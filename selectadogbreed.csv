Affenpinscher,Small & Cute Family & Kid Friendly Smart & Trainable ,3-6 kg,Medium,12-14 years,Short,Medium,Very Low,Medium,Medium,,"Are you a fan of small, quirky looking dogs with a big personality? Then the Affenpinscher may just be perfect for you.    Affenpinschers are cute and naughty, brave at heart and very lively. They love to play with other dogs, kids, pets or anybody/thing that comes their way.    If you are looking for a pet that always steals the show, then this breed could be for you, as they are sure to provide a constant stream of entertainment.    Some countries call Affenpinschers “the little devil dog who wears a moustache”. This breed’s funky looks underline its big personality: the underbite, bushy eyebrows, moustache, flat pushed-up nose and hair around the eyes are just some the quirky features that make up its extravagant looks.    Affenpinschers can be quite stubborn and are not that easy to train. But they love their pack and will stick by you when out on walks. They are fine with living in an apartment or house with a garden, as long as they get walked daily.    To keep the Affenpinscher’s coat looking good and not completely wild requires regular brushing. A trim twice a year is recommended.",
Afghan Hound,Active & Energetic ,26-34 kg,Medium,12-14 years,Short,Medium,high,Low,Medium,,"Afghan Hounds are elegant and majestic looking dogs that are also very fast runners, getting up to speeds of 45km per hour!    These unique looking dogs bear themselves with dignity and pride, but are friendly, good natured and laid back at home. They are happy to relax elegantly on the couch like a sphinx, and can watch TV for hours on end without appearing to move or blink an eye.    But don’t let the laid back, low-key homebody image fool you - once outside, Afghan Hounds change into dynamic, energy-releasing dogs with a strong hunting instinct. In fact, some Afghans have such a strong prey drive that they can hardly be let off the leash. They are fast and need to run, so we recommend taking them for runs or teaching them to run alongside a bicycle.    Afghan hounds excel in dog sports such as lure coursing, which appeal to their hunting instincts. Their free spirit and independence can make them hard to train, so they are not recommended for novice dog owners.    Their fine long hair requires lots of grooming otherwise it will knot and mat very easily. Brushing after each outing is recommended to ensure a silky smooth look.",
Airedale Terrier,Active & Energetic Low Shedding Smart & Trainable ,23-29 kg,Very high,10-14 years,Short,High,average,High,High,,"With an overly long looking snout, small pointy batman ears, short cropped tails and wiry hair, Airedale Terriers might not be everyone’s cup of tea. But don’t judge a book by its cover, because Airedales make fine companion dogs that are great to train and fun to be around.    The Airedale Terrier’s sheer lust for life makes them the perfect companion for any active person who loves sharing adventures with their dogs. They want action and want to use their brainpower, and will follow you around the house and look at you with anticipation of what’s coming next. A simple walk around the block twice a day will not do for this breed…Airedales can quickly turn from a terrier into a terror if their brain and body don’t get a sufficient workout!    Airedales are great as watch, hunting or service dogs as they like to work. Rest assured, with some training, patience and clear boundaries, they can also become very obedient and a true companion.    Airedales are a rather robust breed and do not tend to have a lot of illnesses. They have a great temperament but can be quite stubborn like most terriers. Their wiry coats don’t shed much and therefore brushing is only required every second or third day.    <div></div>",

If you are after a social butterfly, this breed will not match what you are looking for - they can be friendly to strangers or completely ignore them. This behaviour may come across as arrogant, but an Akita simply chooses their friends selectively.    Akitas tend to be very calm around the house and do not usually bark much. They are a strong-willed breed that is recommended for an experienced dog owner, as the handler needs to be confident and consistent in order to earn the dog's respect and trust.    Their calm nature gives them the ability to concentrate and work for a long time. Mental stimulation is a must, paired with lots of daily exercise.    <span>The Akita has had a long and troubled history. It is said that the Akita originated in Japan and</span><span>was originally name the Odate Dog, but the name was changed to the Akita in 1931.</span>The Akita's ancestorsworked on their own or in pairs. This may explain why they are not usually the best choice for multi-dog households or off-leash dog parks.","Where to get my Akitafrom? - Rest of the world    Now that you decided which breed your new dog should be, the question is where to get your new family addition. Have you considered adopting? Adoping a dog is a great way to give a dog a second chance to share its unconditional love.

Alaskan Malamute,Active & Energetic Smart & Trainable ,36-43 kg,Very high,12-16 years,Long,High,Average,High,High,,"Alaskan Malamutes are true pack animals. They need the company of other dogs or people and don't do well being home alone.    They are highly inquisitive - they like to test new objects for their bite resistance and will put their nose into every bag they can find.    Alaskan Malamutes love digging and will turn all the plants in your garden up side down ... but you can't possibly stay mad at them when they bat their beautiful eyes at you with a look of pure innocence!    Be warned, they are highly active and need a minimum of three hours exercise a day ... and a relaxed walk around the neighbourhood simply won't do. We recommend teaching them to run alongside a bike or pull a cart with weight to ensure they get their daily work out.    Alaskan Malamutes have no protecting impulse at all ... they hardly ever bark and might not even react when the doorbell rings or visitors arrive!    Lastly, if you are a clean freak then don't even think about getting an Alaskan Malamute as you will find fur in every inch of your home and car, especially when it's shedding season.",
American Bulldog,Protective & Guarding Chilled Out & Relaxed ,30-59 kg,High,10-15 years,Short,Low,very high,Low,Low,,"American Bulldogs are friendly, affectionate and loving dogs that look tough but have a very sensitive gentle soul. With their very strong build they are often misunderstood, as their looks don’t reflect their gentle temperament.    Being too hard or too strict on this breed can hamper their willingness to learn and please immensely. American Bulldogs might seem brave, and they can be when it is absolutely necessary. But in reality their personality is soft and they don’t do well with being reprimanded. They thrive best on praise and treats with rules and structure to follow.    Bred as a working dog, this breed has high energy levels, needs to be active and have a job to do. They do well at many dog sports including Obedience and Schutzhund, or with almost any work you can give them. Being a bulldog, they can be headstrong by nature and require consistent training and rules.    The bulldog looks and strong build are not for everybody but once you got to experience their soft temperament and kindness you will be sure to fall in love with your American Bulldog!",
American Eskimo Dog,Family & Kid Friendly Active & Energetic ,8-16 kg,Medium,13-15 years,Long,High,low,Medium,Medium,,"American Eskimo Dogs love to play…non-stop. They make great playmates for kids - their energy is almost endless and they will only stop playing when the kids have had enough. Daily walks are a must and any dog sport you have time for would be a great added extra for this breed.    American Eskimos are small and very fluffy but don’t be fooled as they sure do have a loud voice. Their small size could make them seem like good apartment dogs but their desire to bark and alert their owners is likely to upset nearby neighbours. They will be protective of their family and act like they are Rottweilers when strangers come to visit, and it may take them a few minutes to settle down with the new arrival.    American Eskimos also enjoy the outdoors too much to be apartment dogs. They are super fast learners, requiring only a few repetitions to teaching a new skill before they get it. Kids will enjoy this challenge and American Eskimo puppies will be able and willing to become circus dogs, as they love to perform what they have learnt.    American Eskimos shed a lot, and their fluffiness comes with a prize … daily brushing is a must for owners that don’t want a house full of dog hair.",
American Staffordshire Terrier,Active & Energetic Family & Kid Friendly Protective & Guarding ,25-30 kg,Medium,10-12 years,Short,Low,Average,Medium,Medium,,"American Staffordshire Terriers (often called American Staffys or Amstafs) make great family dogs and watch dogs.    Their sweet temper, and kind and gentle nature makes them popular family pets. They are very clingy, affectionate and playful, especially with kids, and will show their owners unconditional loyalty.    American Staffordshire Terriers are a strongly built, muscly breed with a short body and a deep chest. They need to learn to control their power and body mass. Early socialisation is therefore of the utmost importance for this breed.    They enjoy any kind of dog sport. They show great talent as assistance dogs or even search-and-rescue dogs, where they can use their brain and muscle power.",
Australian Cattle Dog,Active & Energetic Protective & Guarding Smart & Trainable ,18-22 kg,Medium,12-15 years,Medium,Low,Average,Very high,Very high,,"Australian Cattle Dogs are also known as Blue or Red Heelers, depending on their colour. If you're after an intelligent, hard-wired working dog that's compact, speedy and very versatile, the Australian Cattle Dog could be perfect for you.    Their temperament is hard to categorise, as they can be anything from soft and cuddly to very dominant and protective. But some characteristics you can be certain of, like their wariness of strangers, their need for lots of action, and their faithfulness to their owners. They may also seem like they never need to sleep!    Bred for jobs like herding, or moving cattle, this breed needs a job to be happy. And they usually need more exercise than just walking - agility, obedience and any other dog sports are recommended.    Training a Cattle Dog isn't hard, but you need to be confidant and set boundaries from the start. It is therefore not an ideal breed for first-time dog owners.",
Australian Kelpie,Active & Energetic Family & Kid Friendly Smart & Trainable ,14-20 kg,Medium,11-15 years,Short,Low,Average,Very high,Very high,,"Australian Kelpies are good-looking working dogs that can also make great family dogs as long as they receive lots of physical and mental stimulation.    Kelpies have a keen outlook on things along with a calm, balanced personality. They are orientated to their owner and the children and will thrive living in a big family. But it's worth keeping in mind that they are herding dogs and may sometimes turn this skill on the kids!    Their energy may at times seem inexhaustible. This energy, paired with their intelligence and natural herding instinct makes them highly suitable for farm work.    Kelpies are easy to train but can try to push boundaries. They are used to thinking for themselves so you won't be able to demand and achieve total obedience. Mental stimulation, paired with lots of daily exercise, is an absolute must for this breed.",

They are eager to please and are ideal dogs for agility, obedience, rally or other sports. They have an alert and caring nature and will be at first reserved towards strangers but will slowly warm to them.    The Aussie's job is herding and over generations of breeding they have become the ultimate working dog. Which means that if you don't give them a job to do, they may just find themselves one. So a usually quiet dog like the Aussie can decide to bark a lot if he finds himself a job as watchdog!    Be warned, these dogs are very quick learners and will quickly outsmart you if you let them. They have the ability to think for themselves and even ifthey seem easy to train, they are not easy to raise. You need to make them understand consequences and give them clear rules. Don't get fooled by their cute cuddly looks. They are not just cute - they're highly intelligent and smart and want their minds to be challenged.",

While most terriers are quite headstrong, the Australian Silky Terrier seems to be one of the easier terrier breeds to train.    At home Silky Terriers are alert but uncomplicated little companions who like to follow you around and make sure all is in order. They tend to think they are bigger then they actually are and take actions into their own hands if they are not shown strong leadership from the start. Some can become very yappy and will feel the need protect their territory.    This breed might be small but they are full of beans and need a lot of exercise – if not, they won’t be happy and will show their frustrations. They are easy to train and will thrive doing training with their owners. There isn’t anything cuter than watching an Australian Silky Terrier doing dog agility sport!    Silkies move fast and are keen to assist in catching mice or other unwanted small animals in the house. They tend not to warm to small children and prefer to ignore them.    To keep the shiny smooth look, your Silky’s coat will need to be brushed daily.",
Australian Terrier,Active & Energetic Low Shedding Smart & Trainable ,5.5-7 kg,Medium,12-15 years,Medium,Medium,Low,High,Very high,,"Some people joke about the 'terrier' name deriving from the word 'terror'. Whatever its origins, to avoid terror fromyour terrier, it is vitally important that you provide them with mental stimulation, daily exercise and good leadership.    Like most other terrier breeds, the Australian Terrier tendsto be bossy and will nudge or bark at you until they get what they want. Don't be fooled by their innocent looks and adorable head tilt - they will take over your household if you let them!    Australian Terriers consider a game of chase to be great fun, and at the park they will want to chase a ball or other dogs around for hours. With their boundless energy, they can also excel in agility or other dog sports.    These balls of fun are more suitable for households with no kids as they tend to be a little bit wary of children and their bossy temperament can be too pushy for some children.",
Basenji,Active & Energetic Low Shedding ,10-12 kg,Medium,12-16 years,Short,Low,low,High,High,,"The name Basenji means “small wild thing from the bush” which refers back to the origins of this breed in central Africa, where they tended to live more alongside than actually with people.    Basenjis are best raised as free spirited, independent dogs. They thrive in a pack living arrangement and do not like to be home alone. It is important not to try to humanise this breed in any way.    Basenjis require long daily walks. Their senses are sharp and their hearing and eyesight compares to that of an eagle. Busy city life can be too stressful for this domesticated but yet wild at heart breed. Their hunting instinct is intense and everything that moves is seen as a potential dinner opportunity. Taking your Basenji off the lead requires a lot of training and control over the dog.    Basenjis are called “barkless dogs” as, due to their flat larynx, they cannot bark. But don’t get over excited, Basenjis simply yodel instead!    Your Basenji will pick up on your mood swings like no other breed, and will tend to mirror your emotional state. Living with a Basenji can best be summarised as living with a wild dog that wants to be part of your pack but is still learning how to fit into civilisation.",

The result is a super cute puppy that has the most expressive and sad looking eyes of any puppy we’ve ever seen. If you are a bit of a softy, those eyes will simply make you forgive anything!    When indoor, Beagliers can be real couch potatoes, and enjoy the comforts of being on your lap and having cuddles all day long. But once outside, the Beagle’s detective nose comes through - and wandering away from their owners is a common trait, along with finding anything even slightly edible in the park. When the fresh air hits their nostrils they quickly turn into action-packed super dogs.    Beagliers have the tendency to love everybody and everything. Cute and adorable, they show a lot of affection, not just to their own family but to everyone they come across. They are playful and gentle and make great family dogs that adjust well to different new situations. They just don’t do well with being left home alone for long hours.",

But no matter what trouble they get into, those sad eyes and cute face will make you forgive them for anything!    Beagles are happiest if they get a couple of walks a day and when not left home alone for too long. They love to cuddle and to snuggle up on their beds inside the house at night. They also enjoy having a job, like playing with the kids or 'protecting' them. Without an activity, they are likely to get bored and may become destructive.

You will be surprised how quickly they pick up new tricks and they will figure out any mind games you give them very quickly.    Their eyes are always observing and when they look at you it feels like they can see right inside you. You may not be able to look back into their eyes though, as they are usually covered with hair! Unless, like most owners of this breed, you decide to clip the hair over their eyes to help them see better.    Bearded Collies have a double coat that is soft and long with a thick undercoat. Their coat should not be trimmed – weekly brushing will keep it shiny, and a bath once in a while will do them good. Dirt, sand or mud will dry and just fall off.",

Bedlington Terriers are, in fact, one of the most active dog breeds in the entire doggy universe!    Living with one is like living with an Olympic athlete who just wants to run and run. If you are thinking of keeping this breed in an apartment, four walks a day are required at a minimum, and a walk doesn’t just mean taking them around the block. For this breed, a walk needs to be a long walk including some off lead-time for play. They love to play and can do so for hours, especially if they find a playmate at the park!    Being originally bred for hunting, they are agile, brave and very dynamic. With their hunting genes, letting them off the leash where there may potentially be wildlife is not a good idea. Their bodies are bursting with energy, but once it is released, they are calm and affectionate dogs.    At the moment this is still a rare breed and not that easy to come across. If you don’t have much time on your hands and don’t like being active, then this breed is not for you. They are great companions and family dogs but can be quite stubborn and will thrive with good, consistent training from the start.    Their coat is thick and requires lots of grooming and brushing.

They have a longer muzzle than their Shepherd cousins and a slightly longer neck. Their long black coat requires regular brushing to keep it beautiful and shiny.    Groenendaels make great watch and guard dogs, and if from good breeding lines, should not show any signs of aggression.

Bloodhound,Active & Energetic ,41-50 kg,Medium,10-12 years,Short,Low,very high,Medium,Medium,,"Bloodhounds are equipped with an excellent sense of smell and were traditionally used to track down prey over long distances. Their sense of smell is so great that they are often used as search and rescue dogs or as cadaver dogs, as they can find a scent even when it seems impossible.    Bloodhounds are calm, friendly and intelligent but can also be quite clingy towards their owners. They tend to fixate on their owners and are quite sensitive to any changes. They can often be a bit unruly and seem to have a mind of their own. Good leadership and clear boundaries are a must for Bloodhounds to become good family dogs.    They are not recommended for first time dog owners as their sense of smell can take them places you don’t want them to be, and obedience training is therefore important.    Bloodhounds not only love to run but also have the ability to run and track a scent at the same time by keeping their noses on the ground. Their ears are very long, and have been bred this way to assist them with scent tracking. When running they seem to flop around like bunny ears.    Brushing is recommended once in a while. Other than that you just need to worry about their desire to exercise and run.",

Boerboels are big loving dogs that have a big heart and are always keen to play. They are brave, dutiful, calm, intelligent and make fantastic guard dogs. They adore and love their family and take their job of protecting them very seriously.    Your Boerboel will be your best friend and will know when you need love and affection. He will be able to sense when you simply don’t like somebody, and will move his whole body between you and the other person without you needing to say a word. His presence and body mass will be enough to warn any intruder to back off.    When you invite people over and introduce them to your Boerboel he will accept them. But he will always stay on guard until the person has left the house. If you ever feel in danger, he will know what to do to make you feel safe. His favorite time is when the entire family is home together and he will lie and rest near you to make sure everybody feels safe.

Border Collie,Active & Energetic Smart & Trainable ,17-20 kg,Medium,13-16 years,Long,Medium,Average,Very high,Very high,,"Border Collies are highly intelligent working dogs that require lots of mental stimulation and a physical outlet. Due to their great looks, warm face and smarts, they are becoming more and more popular as family pets.    Owners of Border Collies need to be prepared to dedicate around 2-3 hours every day to physical and mental exercise. Border Collies are very quick learners and you will often find them doing brilliantly at dog sports like agility, nose work or fly ball. They are eager to please and will be happy to show off all the tricks and skills you teach them.    Border Collies like to be praised for their work and will always give 100%. They don't like any kind of negative feedback and punishment is very hard for them to digest.    Their chase and herding instinct is inbred and needs to be given a controlled outlet. They love chasing balls and would rather drop dead than stop chasing. If not given enough of a workout for their brain, Border Collies can develop behavioural issues like chasing lights and shadows to the point where they put themselves in danger.",
Border Terrier,Active & Energetic Family & Kid Friendly Small & Cute ,5-7 kg,Low,12-15 years,Short,Low,very low,Medium,High,,"Behind a rough shell of thick wiry hair, the Border Terrier is a beautiful, loving family dog that loves to have his pack around him and enjoys adventures with them.    Border Terriers don’t seem to be as boisterous as other terrier breeds and tend to get along well with other dogs and humans. Another positive for this terrier breed is that they hardly shed any fur. But, as with all other terrier breeds, Border Terriers have their own minds and can be quite stubborn. Whilst they are easy to train, they won’t always follow commands when they don’t think it’s the right thing to do. That’s a terrier for you…it’s not that they don’t know, they simply decide for themselves when something is right and when it isn’t.    Border Terriers have a robust build as they were used to hunt, and still are in some parts of the world. They are unlikely to get cold under that thick coat, which doesn’t require much grooming – just a trim once or twice a year.    This breed requires lots of exercise, and if well exercised, they will be a delight to have as calm family members inside the house. Early training and socialisation is recommended, especially if you want to avoid them chasing and hunting down any small animals. They aren’t very good being left at home for long hours on their own.",
Borzoi,Family & Kid Friendly Chilled Out & Relaxed ,34-47 kg,Medium,7-10 years,Long,Medium,high,Low,Low,,"Borzois are aristocratic looking sight hounds from Russia that are amazing runner sand require large spaces to run. To witness their full beauty when running it is best to find a fenced-off area, as once they take on speed not much can stop them.    Borzois are happiest when they can run fast for short periods. At home they are happy to lounge around and relax. They are quite attached to their owners and will follow them around. Because of their strong chasing instincts, it is important to train Borzois from a very young age. If anything moves, their instincts to chase will kick in and you may not be able to stop them…they will chase until they drop!    Having two Borzois is a great idea so they can entertain themselves when you are at work. Borzois like company, preferably 24/7, from either a human or another dog.    This breed is brave and they needed to be as their job in the past was to chase larger animals, like horses, wolves, foxes and rabbits.    Borzois make great family dogs and are relaxed and chilled at home. They need a house with a garden, where you will find them outside sunbathing from time to time.    They have amazing eyesight and if you take them on walks where there is wildlife around, you may find it extremely hard to hold them back. Your Borzoi will spot the wildlife before you and teaching them to come back is of utmost important.",

Boston Terriers are lovable, attentive and easy going. Great with other animals, they adjust easily to new situations. Due to their size and confidence they can be taken everywhere and will happily go with you on any adventure.    They enjoy long walks, but their short noses - which can make breathing a bit more difficult - combined with their heat sensitivity, mean they aren't likely to become extreme athletes.    Boston Terriers might prefer doggy dancing or obedience training as an outlet, where they can use their smarts and charisma to outperform the bigger breeds.    Boston Terriers are very affectionate and might decide to run up to you and give you a face wash at any time ... so be prepared for dog slobber! Their charm and silliness makes it hard to say no. They are likely make you laugh with their funny snorting sounds or begging eyes at the dinner table.    Boston Terriers simply looooove food, and it's easy to teach them great tricks using food as a reward. Who knows, they may even help you load the dishwasher by pre-washing the dishes!",

The true beauty of this breed lies not in their looks but in their temperament.    As a working dog they require plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. With their high willingness to please, they are easy to train, although they don’t do well with learning under pressure and will instantly shut down if yelled at. They are best to train through praise, reward and a good dose of humour.    Bouvier Des Flandres’ are true one person dogs. They will tolerate and love the rest of the family but you are likely to find that they are really attached to one person only. During the day they are happiest by your side and at night you won’t be able to escape either – if they have their way, they will be sharing your bed! They will tolerate being left home alone on some occasions, but not all the time.    Maintenance of their coats is time intense. They requires a 1-hour brush, 2-3 times a week. Grooming every 2-3 months is also a must.",
Boxer,Active & Energetic Family & Kid Friendly Protective & Guarding ,30-32 kg,Very high,10-12 years,Short,Low,Above average,Medium,High,,"If you don't mind the slobber, Boxers can make a perfect family dog.    Willingness to please and obey commands is in their nature, which makes Boxers quite easy to train. They have a calm nature combined with a soft gentle temperament and tend to be gentle with children. However, we recommend early socialisation with children to ensure this is the case.    With a strong tendency to protect their own, Boxers will be devoted and attached to their family. However, they can be quite skeptical and mistrustful towards strangers.    They will usually bark to alert their pack and for this reason we would not recommend this breed as an apartment dog.    Regular exercise is quite important for Boxers but it doesn't have to be over the top. They won't mind if they miss one walk per week.",

These days they are more suited to being family dogs than farm dogs as they love being close to their people. However, they still have the energy of farm dogs and you will need to give them an outlet to let off this energy, preferably through endless play.    Briards need an active lifestyle and keeping them involved in day-to-day activities is a must. This breed has a wonderfully sweet face and an even more beautiful, devoted nature. They are not only friendly and balanced but also make very good watchdogs. They are extremely friendly to children, devoted to their owners, brave and intelligent.    Agility and other dog sports are a must for you to participate in with your Briard. They have also gained more and more popularity as therapy dogs as well as search and rescue dogs. They will wrap you around their little finger with their sweet angel faces, but Briards can also be very stubborn, and a consistent upbringing is highly recommended.    They have a very bubbly personality, which, combined with lots of energy might not be suitable for first time dog owners.    Their coat requires daily brushing otherwise it will get matted easily.",
British Bulldog,Family & Kid Friendly Chilled Out & Relaxed Protective & Guarding ,23-25 kg,Very high,7-10 years,Short,Low,Average,Medium,Low,,"When you think of a British bulldog, think of immense inner calm, which is hard to disturb. Their patience and calmness makes this breed the ideal companion for families with kids. This is especially true if you have a busy family life and can't exercise your dog much.    British Bulldogs don't need much exercise but will enjoy being taken along to your kids' sporting activities or any other activities. They are great for city life as they prefer to cruise around the streets and then go home and lie on the couch with you for some relaxation time.    Although they seem like a very chilled-out breed, they are quite sensible and find unfair treatment very insulting.    Their wrinkles need to be looked after on a daily basis to ensure they are clean and to avoid skin infections. As a result of over-breeding, they tend to have quite a few health issues. Warning, with this breed, it is quite common to spend a fair bit of time at the vet.",

They are quite laid back but alert and like to live life to its fullest. They best suit families with lots of kids to keep them busy and a house with a big garden.    This spaniel is a hunting dog with a very well developed sense of smell that will take him places once his nose catches a scent. Therefore early training of “Come when called” is a must. The Brittany Spaniel is easy to train and keen to work. Compared to other spaniels, they are more independent workers who don’t require much human input to complete a job once they know how.    The Brittany Spaniel is sensitive and especially gentle and respectful towards children and elderly people. He will show off his soft side and be the perfect gentleman. But beware, he can get over-excited with younger children and interactions should always be supervised.    A Brittany Spaniel is perfect for the active family but not a dog for first time dog owners, as you will need to be able to control his hunting desire.    His fur is wavy at the tips, almost like an outgrowing perm, and requires daily brushing and care to avoid it becoming dull.",

They are good companions that bond strongly with their humans, and can be great pets for families or older people.    They adjust well to any lifestyle but don't do well with being left alone at home. They would rather be part of the action - be it sitting for hours at your feet while you work or out at your local café.    Brussels Griffons have quite a unique look and some people say they look like a character out of Star Wars as their heads look over-sized compared to the rest of their body. Their face is quite flat and the thick fur above their eyes looks like eyebrows, which gives their face a human touch. Their fur is wiry at the end, which gives them a shaggy look.    While their unique look may not be for everybody, their easy going nature adapts well in all every situation.",

But their looks don't reflect how sociable they can actually be and how easy going and calm they are towards their family.    Bullmastiffs are quite intelligent and have a courageous personality. Bred and used to be guard dogs, their instincts are to protect their families. This will need to be kept in mind when introducing a Bullmastiff to strangers.    This is not a dog for first time dog owners. Absolute obedience can hardly be expected from Bullmastiffs, as they are quite stubborn and willful and will push boundaries.",
Bull Terrier,Family & Kid Friendly Protective & Guarding ,22-33 kg,Very high,10-14 years,Short,Low,Above average,Medium,Medium,,"Bull Terriers are very loyal and focused on their owners. They thrive on body contact and attention. They love a good play and can easily get overexcited.    Keeping their emotions in check isn't a BullTerrier's strength. They might knock you over from sheer excitement but they don't mean any harm. Don't get put off by their loud hysteric barking, this is just part of the love they have to give!    When you think of work life balance, this breed has it down pat. They are happy with a little bit of action and a nice couch to sleep on, preferably next to a human.

This breed is the perfect companion dog that can adjust to family living or a single household if given a lot of attention and time with their humans.    Cairn Terriers are smart and are fast learners - of good habits as well as the not so good ones. But with a consistent and loving upbringing, as well as a clear understanding of who is in charge, this little dog will thrive as a human companion.    Training should be started early and be regular to make sure your adorable Cairn Terrier puppy doesn’t become a nuisance in your house and the neighbourhood.    Cairn Terriers are very confident dogs and it can easily be “my way or no way” with this breed. Their combination of curiosity and confidence can mean that they are sometimes more interested in pleasing themselves than you. But once they are trained and family rules established, Cairn Terriers can be very obedient and a delight to live with.    This breed is not recommended for novice dog owners, and they require lots of training throughout their lifetime.",

These days they are not used as much for hunting, but have found their way into our homes as a pet.    Some Cane Corsos still have some have an immense prey drive, which needs to be well managed through a capable handler. This breed will be happiest when having lots of space to run around and isn’t made for city living, or for the novice dog owner.

Chesapeake Bay Retriever,Active & Energetic Family & Kid Friendly Smart & Trainable ,30-36 kg,Medium,10-12 years ,Short,Low,high,High,High,,"This breed, which originated in the USA, was traditionally used for hunting geese and ducks. Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are more common in America than in Europe or Australia, so you may have to search for a breeder if you are interested in getting one.    As they are such skilled retrieving working dogs, they are now used for other work, like search and rescue in water. They are not only brave but also show endurance and are built robustly.    Chesapeake Bay Retrievers’ face and head shape looks like that of a Labrador Retriever, but they have wavy hair on some parts of their body and very oily skin. Their undercoat is so thick that water won’t penetrate the skin and they can swim in icy water without getting cold.    As a family dog they are only suitable when given enough stimulation. If they don’t get enough stimulation, they can become over-protective and guarding, especially if they feel the need to run and protect the pack if there are no clear hierarchy structures.    If their position in the family is clear and their work ethic met, they will make friendly, devoted and loving family dogs. However they will not usually be interested in strangers when they want a cuddle (which they often will, as they have that friendly retriever smile from ear to ear).",

The Chihuahua is one of the smallest dog breeds in the world. You wouldn't think so, but they are brave, active, sensible dogs that require lots of exercise. Think of them as a Rottweiler in a tiny body!    Their small size and cute looks make them a popular dog breed, and they are often seen nowadays as a fashion accessory - carried around in handbags and treated like a soft toy.    Unfortunately Chihuahuas do not enjoy this type of treatment. They need a minimum of two hours' exercise a day in order to be happy. If Chihuahuas do not get the exercise they need, they can easily turn into annoying aggressive-sounding barkers.    Chihuahuas can be great apartment dogs, due to their size. They will also sound like a beefy watchdog protecting you and your pack when visitors come to the door!",

This breed can come without fur (‘Hairless’) or with fur (‘Powder Puff’). Hairless Chinese Cresteds - which usually do have some hair on their head, paws and tail - are the more desirable version of the breed.    Chinese Cresteds might look fragile but you’d be surprised how robust these little dogs are. They adapt easily to new situations and aren’t as complicated to look after as their fancy looks may suggest.    They are happy and confident little dogs that will provide lots of pleasure and are sure to provide great entertainment for their owners. Chinese Cresteds are very loyal companions and their favourite place is sure to be by the side of their owners.    They are comedians who love to entertain and play with their families. But Chinese Cresteds will also enjoy hours of cuddling, lying on you like a heat pack and enjoying a scratch behind the ears.    They are more reserved towards strangers and may seem arrogant. But they are simply taking their time to assess the situation and choosing to only give devotion and love to their owners rather than to strangers.    This breed enjoys walks but doesn’t require much exercise at all - playing and doing tricks is more up their alley.

They require strict rules, lots of exercise and can be a bit touchy with other dogs.    Chow Chows have a huge desire for freedom and will push boundaries on a daily basis. This breed is very willful, self-determined and therefore not easy to train. Chow Chows behave like cats in that they prefer to keep some self-autonomy. Despite their looks, they actually don't enjoy snuggling.    Chow Chows like to bond with one person and are the ideal breed for a single-person household. They can be protective and are quite alert. They are wary of strangers and prefer to be left alone when guests come over.    These dogs need a good dose of daily exercise, but don't cope well with heat due to their very thick fluffy coat.",
Clumber Spaniel,Active & Energetic ,32-39 kg,Medium,10-12 years,Medium,Low,high,Low,High,,"    The Clumber Spaniel is a spaniel that was originally used to find and retrieve game birds for hunters. Clumber Spaniels tend to like one person only and have regular mood swings. They can be “Happy as Larry” one minute and the next won’t even look at you. It’s just like living with a teenager…you have no idea what their mood is going to be at any given time!    Because of their mood swings, Clumber Spaniels are not very popular as family dogs. They tend to look rather serious and when guests enter your house will often pretend they don’t exist. They love their one owner and feel happiest if they can be with that person all the time (just not when they are in their moody phase, when they prefer to be left alone).    Clumber Spaniels love to slobber, snore and wheeze - preferably all at the same time. One might think they do it to keep people away, but that’s just standard behaviour for a Clumber Spaniel. They tend to like their food a bit too much and we recommend to watching their waistline to avoid health problems. Their ears and coat need to be looked after regularly.",

Their coats can range from light curly to curly - as there is no breed standard it will depend on how dominant this trait is in the puppy's parents. This hybrid breed also comes in various sizes, depending on the size of the Poodle in the mix.    Spoodles are very friendly dogs that show a lot of patience towards children and adults alike. They can play for hours with their humans and don't mind fetching the ball a hundred times or even retrieving it out of the water. Being in water is something they especially enjoy. New situations and encounters are managed fearlessly and Spoodles tend to adjust easily to any new situation.    They are also easy to train, as they have inherited lots of intelligence from their Poodle side (and good looks from their Cocker side!) ... a match that will make you fall in love with this breed.    Spoodles are great for novice dog owners as long they understand that this hybrid breed needs a good amount of daily exercise. Otherwise you might end up with a chewed table leg or two!",
Cocker Spaniel,Family & Kid Friendly Active & Energetic ,13-15 kg,Medium,12-15 years,Medium,High,Average,High,High,,"The Cocker Spaniel's trademarks are those enormous ears that are almost guaranteed to fall into theirwater bowl. Did you know that you can even buy special bowls to ensure their ears stay dry when drinking?    Cocker Spaniels are affectionate, loyal and energetic dogs. They are great with children, the elderly and other pets, as long as they are socialised and trained from an early age.    They make fantastic family dogs, as they love to play and burn energy that way. To keep them out of trouble, make sure they get plenty of exercise and mental stimulation through some agility, K9 Nose work or other dog sport.    Cocker Spaniels have an excellent sense of smell. You could hold their nose and they would still be able to smell something far, far away that they want to run to and investigate. For this reason they are often used for drug detection services. If you're planning on getting one we suggest you invest in a good a lead and teach them to come back to you!",
Collie (Rough),Family & Kid Friendly Smart & Trainable ,27-34 kg,Medium,14-16 years,Long,High,Average,High,Medium,,"Most of us who watched the 1950s TV series 'Lassie' fell in love with this beautiful breed.    Collies make great family dogs - they are loyal, trainable, obedient, and clingy. But we warn you - owning a Collie is about more than owning a companion dog. Collies want to be a part of every aspect of your life and every activity that you are involved in.    This breed is extremely intelligent and often will only need to see something once to master it. Sometimes this can make it hard for the owners - simple ball throwing and retrieving won't do, as it's too basic. Collies need more advanced jobs to feel truly happy and challenged. They can learn anything but will also teach you a few things along the way.    If they aren't stimulated and get bored, Collies will typically start herding anything that moves, from cars to motorbikes to kids. If you are not up for the challenge give this breed a pass, as they will keep you on your toes.",

They are bigger than other breeds and their coats have very tight small curls all over to protect them from the cold. Curly Coated Retrievers come in black or brown and have brown almond-shaped eyes.    Even though they look just like a curly-haired version of a Labrador, their heads are actually a bit pointier and they don’t have that wide Labrador smile.    Curly Coated Retrievers are also unique in many other ways. This working dog is used for a variety of jobs from hunting to pulling fishing nets out of the water, working as sled dogs or even for herding.    They are true multi-taskers as they are competent at whatever job you decide to put them on and will do it to his best of their abilities. They are also good at guarding and protecting and will eagerly take on the role of family watchdog.    Curly Coated Retrievers prefer one designated handler rather than the entire family to manage their raising and training. They tend to fixate on one person and become their shadow, and thrive praise and acknowledgment from their owner.",
Dachshund (Miniature Smooth Haired),Small & Cute Active & Energetic ,4-5 kg,Medium,14-16 years,Medium,Low,Low,Medium,High,,"Miniature Dachshunds are not only adorably cute, they are also willful little creatures on short legs.    Their very short toothpick legs and their long body give them that waddling look when they walk ... it seems like their tummy is almost rubbing on the floor!    But don't be fooled - they may look small and slow but they are an action packed dog with lots of courage, independence and endurance ... and they can run fast too! With a Miniature Dachshund, daily walks can feel more like a rabbit-sniffing adventure than actually walking.    They love food and tend to gain weight easily. This can cause health problems, but other than that they are a very hardy breed.    Mini Dachshunds are not easy to train as they love to chase and hunt, are stubborn and very smart. Any weakness they sense, they will use to their advantage. And how are you going to say 'no' to that tiny body, puppy eyes and floppy ears anyway?",
Dachshund (Standard),Small & Cute Active & Energetic Smart & Trainable Protective & Guarding ,10-15 kg,Medium,14-16 years,Short,Low,low,Medium,High,,"The Dachshund is one of the oldest breeds around and in past years has really came back into fashion. They are seen around more and more as companion dogs. Standard sized Dachshunds (or really any sized Dachshunds) love their walks. It’s not that important how long the walk is, but more how much time they get to sniff and dig around in the field – that’s what excites them the most. They are adventurers by heart and have no fear. They seem to have non-stop energy, and their outlet is sniffing, digging and chasing. The more the better, and the calmer they will be later at home. Their no fear attitude is demonstrated when you see little Dachshunds with their short legs chasing Great Danes or German Shepherds around the park. Their lack of size doesn’t deter Dachshunds, it seems like they even enjoy the challenge! Some people say ‘When a Dachshund looks in the mirror, he sees a lion.’ We couldn’t agree more.Barking is just like talking for this breed and they are absolute chatterboxes. They love to bark to get your attention, when they hear a noise, to alert you when they want a back scratch, to let you know when they are hungry or just to tell the world that they are there. Being very independent and fearless can make these little guys hard to train. They will take things into their own paws, which can become dangerous at times. They love to cuddle and to curl up on your lap, but will never just be happy doing this as they are working dogs by nature. They like to develop a special bond with their owners and are great for single households where the owner has lots of time on their hands for training and walks.",
Dalmatian,Active & Energetic ,23-25 kg,High,10-13 years,Short,Low,Average,Medium,High,,"This breed found fame through the Disney Movie '101 Dalmatians'. But it is not only the movie that made the breed well known - with their white coat and black (or brown) polka dots, Dalmatians certainly do stand out in any crowd.    This distinctive look along with playfulness, friendliness and lots and lots of energy to burn are the breed's trademarks. Dalmatians are calm and relaxed at home but once out and about, they want to run for hours. If you love jogging, bike or horse riding, they will happily participate.    Dalmatians like a pack structure but their position in the pack needs to be clear. If the rules are not clearly established, they will make their own and can become pushy, wanting to take over the household.    This, coupled with their sheer never-ending energy makes Dalmatians more suitable for experienced dog owners.",

This is not only one of the largest breeds but also one of the oldest, originating in Scotland where they were traditionally used to hunt deer.    These sight hounds grow from very small, cute puppies to giant dogs that will need to learn about their own size. They generally learn this by bumping into things with their long limbs and rear-end. This is all part of learning how to operate their large body.    Deerhounds are gentle giants that are always friendly and calm and tackle everything with dignity. They tend to be more reserved towards people and other dogs. They are not aggressive or distrustful, it’s more as if they know they could hurt them with their power and the size of their body, and would rather stay away to avoid any confrontation.    As a family dog they show great potential, and are patient, loving and very tolerant towards kids. They look for constant participation and want to be amongst the pack, which is sometimes hard to manage because they are so huge. A small apartment or a small house is not going to work for this breed.    Deerhounds’ coats require low maintenance and always look shaggy. It is recommended that you brush them once in a while to keeps thing out of their coats.",

They are very loyal, eager to learn and to please. Being in the Top 10 smartest dog breeds, teaching them a new trick or command is very easy.

The combination of loyalty and protective instinct make Dobermans a great guard dog - if the owner wants to focus on developing this trait.

And then you will find a huge paw on you begging for extra cuddles!They make good guard dogs, and as they have been bred as watchdogs but also for search and rescue missions, they will be quick to take action if they feel their family is in danger. As young dogs they are full of beans and like to jump around and rumble. In middle age they get more lazy and moving seems more like hard work. Older St. Bernards prefer lazing around and enjoy extra cuddles rather than too much action. St. Bernards make a great family dog, but due to their large size they are not recommended for families with small children. They are also not recommended for hot countries or regions because of their very thick coat.",

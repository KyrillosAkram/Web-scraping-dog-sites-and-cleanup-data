They are not purebreds like their Afghan Hound or Labrador Retriever parents.The most common Afador colors include black, brown, gray, red, and fawn.Shedding will definitely occur! Lots of grooming is required to keep the breed's coat in good condition--consider twice weekly brushing to be the minimum.The Afador does much better in colder climates rather than warm ones. Even so, kit your Afador out with a suitable winter coat if temperatures really drop.As an athletic mixed breed, the Afador will love to play fetch and folic in a safe off-leash environment. If you have a fenced-in yard, be warned that this is a dog that can easily leap over a six foot fence, so plan accordingly.Due to the breed's intelligence and stubborn streak, you'll want to make sure that both the dog and your children are properly trained to be around each other from day one.","The Afador is usually described as a medium-sized dog. Although, as is always the case with newer mixed dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 50 to 75 pounds and range in height from 20 to 29 inches. Female Afadors are often noticeably smaller than their male counterparts.","Let's get straight to the point: The Afador is a dog that has a reputation for being very tricky to train. This comes from the breed's innate intelligence, which can also result in a stubborn streak. An experienced dog owner will be better suited to correctly training the Afador. If you have young kids in the house, also beware that the athletic nature of the breed can mean that children might get knocked over or injured during play sessions with the dog.Once properly trained, your Afador will prove to be a super loyal dog. They can perform guard duty and will bark to alert you to the presence of strangers.Afadors also require a strict exercise routine--otherwise there's a chance they'll get used to being lazy and might pick up associated health problems. If you have a large yard, then you'll be better suited to adopting an Afador.","Afadors are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Afghan Hound and Labrador Retriever face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Afadors suffer from include:BloatHip and Elbow DysplasiaSubaortic Stenosis","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Afador's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Aim to provide the breed with around 45 minutes of exercise per day as a minimum. As an athletic mixed breed, the Afador will love to play fetch and folic in a safe off-leash environment. If you have a fenced-in yard, be warned that this is a dog that can easily leap over a six foot fence, so plan accordingly.Beyond exercise, make sure to check your Afador's ears at least once a week. This way, you'll be able to clean them and make sure there's no risk of wax building up. Ask your vet for advice if you're unsure of how best to clean a dog's ears. Clip their nails as needed. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can give you advice on how to do this.","An ideal Afador diet should be formulated for a medium breed with high energy.Afadors need to stick to a healthy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems--especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Afador's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Afador's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","The most common Afador colors include black, brown, gray, red, and fawn.The Afador's coat is medium in length and is usually described as straight with a medium density. Shedding will definitely occur! Lots of grooming is required to keep the breed's coat in good condition--consider twice weekly brushing to be the minimum. Also get ready to undertake regular shampooing sessions. Your vet can help you select an appropriate shampoo to use.The Afador does much better in colder climates rather than warm ones. Even so, kit your Afador out with a suitable winter coat if temperatures really drop.","If you have very young children, the Afador might not be the best match for your family. The breed does much better with older children--not least because Afadors can become quite boisterous during play times. Due to the breed's intelligence and stubborn streak, you'll want to make sure that both the dog and your children are properly trained to be around each other from day one.Most Afadors will be okay living with other animals and pets--but you will need to very quickly let the breed know that cats and rabbits are not to be considered as prey.Ultimately, early socialization pays off--so make sure to reward your Afador for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regime when you bring them home to your family.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Afadors because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Afghan Hound or Labrador Retriever breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well. Here are some rescues you can try:Afghan Hound Rescue of Southern California, Inc.Lucky Lab Rescue & AdoptionYou can also try DogTime's adoption page that lets you search for adoptable dogs by breed and zip code!",not available

Crate training is recommended.While the fur of an Affenpinscher is wiry and is often considered hypoallergenic, this is not to be mistaken with ""non-shedding."" All dogs shed or produce dander.Because of their heritage as ratters, Affenpinschers tend to not do well with rodent pets such as hamsters, ferrets, gerbils, etc. They do, however, tend to get along with fellow dogs in the household and can learn to get along with cats, especially if they're raised with them.Affenpinschers are generally not recommended for households with toddlers or small children--it is not a breed that is naturally inclined to like children. The Affenpinscher is loyal to his adult family members and can be a great companion for a family with older children.The Affenpinscher is a rare breed. Be prepared to spend time on a waiting list if you're interested in acquiring one.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Affenpinschers are 9.5 to 11.5 inches tall and weigh 7 to 9 pounds.,"The Affen is affectionate and curious, always on the alert. He's loyal to his family and will do his tiny best to protect them from harm. It's important to prevent him from taking on dogs ten times his size. He's excitable and can take a while to calm down in the face of anything he views as a threat.Like every dog, Affenpinschers need early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Affen puppy grows up to be a well-rounded, outgoing, friendly dog and stays that way. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Affenpinschers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Affens will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts--the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)--is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Legg-Perthes Disease: Generally a disease of small breeds, this condition--a deformity of the ball of the hip joint--usually appears at 6 to 9 months of age and can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Heart Murmurs: Heart murmurs are caused by a disturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They're an indicator that there may be a disease or condition of the heart that will need to be monitored and treated.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Affens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","The Affenpinscher is an ideal dog for apartment living, especially if you have neighbors who don't mind occasional barking. Short, brisk walks or a suitable length of time in the backyard is enough exercise for this sturdy but only moderately active dog.Because he's so small, the Affenpinscher should be a full-time housedog, with access only to a fully fenced backyard when not supervised. These dogs won't hesitate to confront animals much larger than themselves, an encounter that could result in tragedy.Like many toy breeds, the Affenpinscher can be difficult to housetrain. Be patient and consistent. Crate training is recommended.The key to training an Affenpinscher is to always keep training fun. Use lots of praise and motivation!","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Affenpinscher trim by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Affen, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Shaggy but neat describes the Affenpinscher's desired appearance. He has a thick, rough coat with a harsh texture, approximately one inch long on the body, shorter on the rump and tail, and longer and shaggier on the head (where it contributes to the monkeylike expression), neck, chest, stomach, and legs. The longer fur around the head and shoulders resembles a cape. Affens don't shed much, but their rough coat must be stripped to maintain its characteristic texture.You'll find the Affenpinscher dressed in black, gray, silver, black and tan, or red, which ranges from brownish to an orangey tan. Some red Affenpinschers have black, brown, or white hair mixed in with the red, along with tan furnishings, and some black Affenpinschers have a few white or silver hairs mixed in. The furnishings--the longer hair--may be a bit lighter than the rest of the body. In Europe, Affenpinschers come only in black, sometimes with a light frosting of gray.To maintain the shaggy but neat appearance, brush your Affen weekly with a small slicker brush, then comb him with a metal ""greyhound"" comb. Use your fingers to gently break up any mats or tangles you come across. It can help to spray them with detangler solution first. There's a lot more to trimming and stripping the Affen's coat to achieve his distinctive appearance, but it's easily learned. Your dog's breeder can show you how, or you can find instructions on the Affenpinscher Club of America website. Be patient and persistent while grooming your Affen, and you'll both be happy with the results.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Like most small breeds, Affens have issues with periodontal disease. Brush their teeth several times a week to help remove tartar and bacteria. Daily is best.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Affenpinscher enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Affenpinscher to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Affenpinschers don't like aggressive behavior such as hitting, unwanted squeezing or hugging, or chasing to catch them or cornering them to hold in a lap. If they can't escape, they will defend themselves by growling or snapping. For these reasons, they are not good choices for homes with young children. Often young children don't understand that a cute little Affenpinscher might not want ""love and kisses.""It's a good idea to socialize any puppy to young children, even if he won't be living with them, but you should always supervise their interactions. Never let young children pick up a puppy or small dog. Instead, make them sit on the floor with the dog in their lap. Pay attention to the dog's body language, and put him safely in his crate if he appears to be unhappy or uncomfortable with the child's attention.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Affenpinschers usually get along well with other dogs and cats in the family, but like most toy breeds they are completely unaware of their size and will take on dogs much bigger than themselves. Be prepared to protect them from themselves.",Affenpinschers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may wind up in need of adoption or fostering.Affenpinscher Rescue,"Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Affenpinscher.Affenpinscher Club of America"

Only those who really enjoy grooming, or are willing to pay a professional groomer to do it, should consider an Afghan Hound.The Afghan's natural hunting instinct prompts him to chase prey (the neighbor's cat, your son's rabbit, the third grade class hamster, etc.).The Afghan Hound can be challenging to train due to his independent nature. Training can take a long time and requires patience. House training can be difficult. This breed can continue having accidents in the house up to about six months of age.The Afghan Hound has a low pain tolerance. A minor wound is more bothersome to this breed than to other breeds, and this dog can sometimes seem whiny or babyish.Afghan Hounds are sensitive and high-spirited and do not respond well to rough handling--so be gentle.Although this particular breed is usually good and even loving with children, it is best if the puppy grows up with the children he'll live with and the children are mature enough to understand the importance of being considerate of this dog's sensitive nature.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Males are 27 inches (plus or minus one inch) and about 60 pounds, and females 25 inches (plus or minus one inch) and about 50 pounds.","The Afghan Hound is typically a one-person or one-family dog. Do not look for this hound to eagerly greet your guests. More likely, he will offend them by being indifferent to their presence. While some hounds may bark once or twice when a stranger enters the home, this breed is not known to be a good watchdog.The independent thinking of the Afghan makes it a challenge to train. This hound is generally not motivated by food and does not possess as strong a desire to please as many other breeds (Golden Retriever, for example). Though the Afghan makes a stunning presentation in the show ring, for example, more than one professional handler has been embarrassed in the ring by a refusal to cooperative. Even so, this breed is known for outperforming other breeds when the decision to do so is his own.Rough handling can cause this dog to become withdrawn or mildly antagonistic. Gentle handling, kindness, and patience work best with this breed, along with an understanding that there will be times when the dog simply will not cooperate.","Afghans are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Afghans will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Allergies: Symptoms in the Afghan are the same as in people: sneezing, eye and nasal discharge, itching, hair loss, and lethargy. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Cancer: Symptoms that may indicate canine cancer include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.Juvenile cataracts: The Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF) defines cataracts as a ""partial or complete opacity of the lens,"" and warns this is the leading cause of vision loss in dogs. Depending on the severity, cataracts may sometimes be removed surgically.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. Symptoms include chronic ear infections, bacterial infections of the skin, hair loss, lethargy, and depression. This condition is most commonly treated with medication and diet.","Afghan Hounds prefer being inside with family. They're laid back and calm in the house but are naturally active dogs and need daily exercise, which ideally includes a leash walk or run, plus a free-run in fenced area.High, secure fencing is a must if you plan on keeping your hound in a yard. The Afghan is an adept escape artist and once loose, is truly hard to catch. (Remember, he can outrun horses!) Consistent obedience training is necessary and positive reinforcement methods work best.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

It is very fine in texture, similar to human hair, and thick and silky. On the head is a long, silky topknot. With the exception of the back, the entire body is abundantly covered in hair, even the ears and feet. The hair is short and close along the back and smooth in mature dogs.All solid colors are allowed by the American Kennel Club breed standard (standardized guidelines for the breed), with certain color combinations considered the most pleasing.Grooming is a must for the Afghan. Because the coat is fine, it has a tendency to tangle easily. Regular, even daily, brushing and combing is necessary, as is frequent bathing. Many owners elect to hire a professional groomer to keep the coat in good condition because grooming the Afghan is so time consuming and difficult; it is certainly not a job for beginners, though owners can learn to manage the coat if they are willing to work hard.All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Afghan's ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Afghan may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Afghan's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Irish Setter enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Afghan to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

The Afghan is not likely to want to follow around and play with children. In fact, a child's quick movements and noise level can startle the Afghan. With proper socialization, though, the Afghan can adjust to life in a family with children and be loving and with them.The Afghan tends to most enjoy the company of his own kind--other Afghan Hounds. The Afghan will tolerate, even be indifferent, to other pets in a household. Not surprisingly, the Afghan's hunter's instinct leads him to chase small animals, especially if they run away.","Afghans are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

He will pick up just about anything (socks, underwear, children's toys) to add to his stash of treasures.Being a high-energy working dog, the Airedale Terrier needs daily exercise. In general, the he remains active and full of energy throughout his life. He is not suited to apartment life, and needs a home with a large, fenced yard.Chewing is another favorite Airedale habit. He will chew anything, and should be left in a crate or secure kennel with sturdy toys when you are away from home.The Airedale is an independent dog, but he enjoys being a member of a family. He is happiest when inside with his owners, and is not meant to be a backyard dog.Airedale Terriers are very good with children and are fondly called reliable babysitters. However, children and dogs should never be left unsupervised.Grooming is necessary, so plan on paying a professional groomer or learn to groom your Airedale yourself.Training and socialization is essential to teach the Airedale proper canine manners. If he is not used to other dogs and people, he can be quarrelsome.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Males stand 23 inches tall, and weigh about 50 to 65 pounds. Females are slightly shorter, and weigh 40 to 55 pounds.","The Airedale is a hard-working, independent, and athletic dog with a lot of drive, energy, and stamina. He is prone to digging, chasing, and barking — behaviors that come naturally to terrier breeds. These traits can be frustrating to owners unfamiliar with the Airedale personality.If you are thinking about an Airedale, consider whether you are willing to live with his propensity toward potentially undesirable behaviors — and whether you want to take on the challenges that go along with his independent nature. If you decide you are, you will be delighted with the Airedale's active, fun-loving, even comical attitude.The Airedale is a lively breed, and he needs plenty of activity. Don't leave him alone for long periods of time, or he is likely to become bored, which leads to the aforementioned destructive behaviors. Keep training interesting and fresh — repetitive exercises will become a bore to the Airedale. He is best motivated by treats and other positive reinforcement methods; drill-and-jerk training methods should be avoided.A reliable watchdog, the Airedale takes pride in protecting his family. He can be a fierce guardian, but is friendly with his family and friends.Ultimately, temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Airedale needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Airedale puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Airedales are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Airdale is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Umbilica Hernia: Present at birth, this is an affliction in which abdominal fat or internal organs protrude against the abdominal wall near the umbilicus. If the hernia is small, it can be left untreated. Some small hernias spontaneously close by the time the puppy is 6 months old and some dogs live with small hernias their entire lives without difficulty. Large hernias require surgery, which is often done while the dog is spayed or neutered. Surgery is used to prevent a more serious condition in which an intestine loop drops into the hernia causing life threatening strangulation of the intestine.Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.Hemorrhagic Gastroenteritis: This disorder causes vomiting and diarrhea with either fresh or digested blood. This disorder comes on very quickly, and the cause is unknown. Diagnosing is a process of elimination because many other diseases cause similar symptoms. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis needs prompt medical treatment. Although it run its course within a few days, the dog needs treatment of intravenous fluids to keep hydrated. If the dog becomes dehydrated, his red blood count will continue to rise until the blood becomes thick and slow moving. This can cause another disorder, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and can result in death. The disorder is also treated with antibiotics and anti-ulcer medications.Cancer: Like humans, dogs can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancers, and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically.","The Airedale Terrier is a working dog, and has the energy and stamina that goes with it. He needs regular exercise — at least one walk a day, although two is preferable, coupled with a good romp in the backyard. The Airedale loves to retrieve, play, swim, and goof around. He is a great jogging companion, and in many cases, will tire out his owner.Training and socialization (the process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other dogs and people) are essential for the Airedale, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your Airedale with you to many different places — the pet supply store, outdoor events, long walks in busy parks. (Even if you don't imagine many children will be visiting your home, it is important to expose him early to kids of all ages.) Anywhere there are a lot of people to meet and sights to see is a good place to take an Airedale.Crate training is also strongly recommended with the Airedale Terrier. Not only does it aid in housetraining, it also provides him a safe den in which to settle down and relax. In general, Airedales do very well with most training as long as you remember that they have a mind of their own. Ask him to sit or stay in full sunlight in the middle of the summer and it's very likely he'll decide he'd prefer to do so in the shade.Positive reinforcement is the best way to teach an Airedale. If you approach training with a positive, fun attitude, and you have a lot of patience and flexibility, there's an excellent chance you will have freethinking Airedale who is also well trained.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Airedale in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Airedale, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The handsome coat of the Airedale Terrier has two layers: a topcoat, which is dense and wiry, and an undercoat, which is short and soft. Most Airedales Terriers have a specific coat combination: the majority of the dog is tan (ears, legs, head, underbelly, and occasionally the shoulders) and the back and upper sides are either black or grizzled (black mixed with gray and white). Sometimes there is a speckling of red in the black and a small white star on the chest.The Airedale Terrier is not known for extreme shedding, but he does shed certain times of the year. Regular brushing keeps the coat in good condition (once or twice a week), and periodic bathing as needed (over-bathing is not recommended, as this softens the coarse terrier coat).The family Airedale doesn't have to be trimmed, but most owners do have him groomed by a professional groomer three to four times a year to give him a neat appearance (an untrimmed coat is thick, curly, and unruly). The coat is either trimmed with clippers, by stripping (a process by which the coat is thinned and shortened with a sharp, comb-like tool called a stripping knife), or a combination of both.Paying a professional groomer to groom your Airedale is costly, and should be taken into consideration when selecting this breed. Highly motivated owners can learn how to trim their own dogs, but it's not easy and is time consuming.Brush your Airedale's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Airedale to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The fun-loving Airedale makes a good family pet. In some cases, he may even become protective of the children in the home, but his large size and high activity level may prove too intense for extremely young kids.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Airedale gets along well with other dogs in his household, as long as he is properly socialized and trained. He can be aggressive, however, with strange dogs that he perceives as threatening. And given the Airedale's reputation as a hunter, he is very likely to chase animals he perceives as prey, including cats, rabbits, gerbils, and hamsters.","Airedales are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Airedales in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Airedale rescue.Airedale Club of America Rescue and Adoption CommitteeAiredale Terrier Rescue and Adoption","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Airedale Terrier.Airedale Terrier Club of America"

Find a rescue or shelter that will vaccinate, provide veterinary care, and require applicants to meet dogs to make sure they are a good fit for their potential forever family.The Akita can aggressive with other dogs and is especially prone to same-sex aggression. They'll need socialization training to overcome these tendencies.The Akita is not a good choice for first-time dog owners.Positive socialization and consistent, firm training are essential for the Akita. If he is mishandled or mistreated, they often respond by becoming aggressive.The Akita will chase other pets in the house if not trained properly.The Akita sheds—a lot!Prolonged eye contact is considered a challenge by the Akita, and they may respond aggressively.Training the willful Akita can be challenging and requires understanding, experience, and patience. It's best to work with a trainer familiar with the breed, but be sure to be involved in the training, yourself.",Males stand 26 to 28 inches and weigh 85 to 130 pounds. Females stand 24 to 26 inches and weigh 70 to 110 pounds.,"The Akita is a bold and willful dog, naturally wary of strangers but extremely loyal to their family. They are alert, intelligent, and courageous. They tend to be aggressive toward other dogs, especially those of the same sex. They are best suited to a one-dog household.With family, the Akita is affectionate and playful. They enjoy the companionship of their family and want to participate in daily activities. They're mouthy and enjoy carrying toys and household items around. Despite the common belief that they never bark, they are in fact noisy, known to grumble, moan—and, yes, bark if they believe the situation warrants it.Be aware, the Akita's strong personality can be overwhelming. They are not the dog for a first-time owner, and they are not for the timid. They need an owner who can provide firm, loving discipline.Activity is essential for this active breed. They need plenty of exercise to keep them from becoming bored and, in turn, destructive.The naturally protective Akita has a propensity to become aggressive if allowed, or if they aren't raised properly. Training the Akita is essential, and so is proper socialization from an early age. Keep in mind that this breed is stubborn, so extra patience is necessary to teach them proper canine manners.","Akitas are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain conditions and diseases.Hip dysplasia is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Reputable breeders offer proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Gastric dilatation-volvulus, commonly called bloat, is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Akitas. It is especially a problem if they eat one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid themselves of the excess air in their stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively, and is retching without throwing up. They also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, showing a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Sebaceous adenitis (SA) is a serious problem in Akitas. This genetic condition is difficult to diagnose and often mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed (for unknown reasons) and are eventually destroyed. These glands typically produce sebum, a fatty secretion that helps prevent the skin from drying out. Symptoms usually first occur when the dog is from one to five years old: affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin and hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin and an unpleasant odor, along with secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if she suspects SA and will then discuss a variety of treatment options with you.","The Akita is happiest and does best when living inside with their family. This breed is not hyper, but they do need daily exercise. Thirty minutes to an hour a day is sufficient for an Akita; brisk walks, jogging (for an adult dog over two years of age), and romping in the yard are favorite activities. Visits to a dog park are probably not a good idea, given the Akita's aggressive tendency toward other dogs.Due to this breed's high intelligence, a varied routine is best. What you don't want is a bored Akita. That leads to such behavior problems as barking, digging, chewing, and aggression. Include the Akita with family activities, and don't leave them alone for long periods at a time.A securely fenced yard is important, too, both for the safety of the Akita and for the safety of strangers who may mistakenly come into their turf. While they aren't typically aggressive with visitors if their family is home, all bets are off if their owners aren't around. The Akita is a loyal guardian, and they'll protect against anything they perceive to be a threat.Special care must be taken when raising an Akita puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast. In addition, don't let your Akita puppy run and play on hard surfaces, such as pavement; normal play on grass is fine. Avoid forced jumping or jogging on hard surfaces until the dog is at least two years old and their joints are fully formed (puppy agility classes, with their one-inch jumps, are fine).","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a dayNOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on their size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference—the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Talk to your veterinarian about formulating an appropriate diet for your individual dog.","There are many different colors and color combinations in the American Akita, including black, white, chocolate, a combination of color and white, or brindle. The Akita is double-coated, with the undercoat being very dense and plush; the topcoat is short.Overall, grooming the Akita isn't terribly difficult. But the Akita is a shedder, so frequent vacuuming will be your new lifestyle if you choose this breed. Akita fur will be found on furniture, clothing, dishes, in food, and will form myriad dust bunnies on floors and carpets. Heavier shedding occurs two or three times a year. Weekly brushing helps reduce the amount of hair in your home, and it keeps the plush coat of the Akita healthy.Despite their self-grooming habits, the Akita also needs bathing every three months or so. Of course, more often is okay if your dog rolls in a mud puddle or something smelly. The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe the ears out weekly, using a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner, to prevent problems.As with all breeds, it is important to begin grooming the Akita at an early age. Making grooming a positive and soothing experience will ensure easier handling as your Akita puppy grows into a large, willful adult.","Adults should always supervise interactions between dogs and kids, and this is especially true with this breed. No child could have a more loyal guardian and playmate than an Akita, but a mistreated Akita can become a liability and may even endanger your child's life. It is imperative to teach youngsters to be respectful and kind in all their interactions with dogs. Play between dogs and kids should always be supervised, even with well-trained dogs.That said, the Akita is suitable for families with older children. They should usually live in a one-pet household, however, because they can aggressive toward other dogs and will chase other pets if not trained properly.","Akitas are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Akitas in need of adoption and or fostering and a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Akita rescue organization.Akita Club of America","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Akita.Akita Club of America"

Toy Alaskan Klee Kais are up to 13 inches tall, while miniatures are 13 to 15 inches in height, and standards are 15 to 17 inches. Most Alaskan Klee Kais are between 10 and 15 pounds, though there can be some as small as 5 pounds or as large as 22 pounds.","Alaskan Klee Kais are intelligent, energetic, and loving to their families. They don't much care for strangers and require lifelong socialization training if they are to be friendly to new people. Their wariness of new faces does, however, make them excellent watchdogs.When it comes to training, Alaskan Klee Kais are quick to pick up on basic commands and may even find themselves at the top of the class. They are eager to please and highly food motivated, and they are more than capable of taking on agility training, which can help burn off some of their high energy throughout the day. Once they have at least a good, long walk and a healthy play session, they're usually happy to spend the rest of the day being couch potatoes, but neglect their exercise needs, and they may become bored, anxious, and destructive. Be careful on walks, as these dogs have a high prey drive that may cause them to bolt if they see wildlife.Alaskan Klee Kais love to be the centers of attention in their families, but they will also be vocal when their needs are not being met. Though they do not tend to be overly mouthy and are generally quieter than their Husky forbears, they will bark and whine to express their displeasure, and they can be sensitive.","The Alaskan Klee Kai is considered to be quite a healthy breed with few genetic problems. However, owners should be aware that the breed is predisposed to certain conditions that they should keep an eye out for, including luxating patella, thyroid disease, heart conditions, liver shunts, factor VII deficiency, and cataracts. They may also keep their baby teeth, which can cause problems when adult teeth grow in. They may need to have these teeth removed.","When it comes to Alaskan Klee Kai care, it is very important to make sure their exercise needs are met, as they may become high strung and anxious if they do not have an outlet to burn off energy. Like any dog breed, they require regular teeth brushings, nail clippings, and ear cleanings. You should ask your veterinarian about your dog's specific needs.","Alaskan Klee Kais are high energy dogs that need a diet that will fuel them throughout the day. Although their energetic nature makes their potential for weight gain fairly low, they need to maintain appropriate nutrition to stay healthy. You should consult your veterinarian or a professional nutritionist for insight on how to meet your Alaskan Klee Kais individual dietary needs.","There are three coat colors recognized as breed standards for the Alaskan Klee Kai. These include red and white, black and white, or gray and white, though solid white Alaskan Klee Kais have also been seen. These coats can be standard or full-coat. Both are double coats, meaning there is a short, soft undercoat and a longer, coarser outer coat that protect dogs from extreme weather.Unlike many other breeds, Alaskan Klee Kais do not usually develop a dog odor, and they generally like to groom themselves, so they may not need to bathe as frequently as some other dogs. They will likely need regular brushing during the seasons in which their coats blow out, which happens before summer and winter. During this time, they tend to shed profusely, while they only shed moderately the rest of the year.","The Alaskan Klee Kai is a dedicated family dog that loves its humans, even children. However, they are small dogs, and children that are very young are not always taught how to interact with animals. They may injure or provoke Alaskan Klee Kais to nip. Children should always be supervised when playing with dogs, and the Alaskan Klee Kai is no exception to that rule.Alaskan Klee Kais are usually good with other dogs, especially if they have been socialized early on, though they have a high prey drive. This makes them ill suited for homes that have smaller pets unless they are specifically trained to live with them.","If you wish to rescue or adopt an Alaskan Klee Kai, you should check out Alaskan Klee Kai National Rescue, a group that takes in Alaskan Klee Kais and provides them with foster homes, training, and veterinary care while they wait for forever homes.

Everyone who lives with the dog must be able to properly deal with this and clearly establish all family members are not to be pushed around.Alaskan Malamutes are notorious diggers. Any fencing should be buried so they cannot dig out of their yard.Alaskan Malamutes are a powerful, independent dogs who, if not properly trained or exercised, can become destructive or bored.With early socialization and training, Malamutes can learn to get along with other dogs and indoor cats. They'll view outdoor cats and other small animals as fair game.Their high prey drive can cause a Malamute to stalk and kill small animals, including birds, squirrels, cats and even smaller dogs. They need to be properly socialized and introduced to other companion animals.Alaskan Malamutes shed heavily twice a year. Their thick double coats are not suited for hot climates.Generally a quiet breed, Malamutes rarely bark. They do hold conversations with you, vocally expressing themselves with ""woo woo"" sounds or loud, extensive howls.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a shelter or rescue who provides medical care and vaccinations for their dogs. Meet the dog you're interested in before you adopt to play with them and make sure you like their personality.","Males stand 25 inches high at the shoulder and should weigh about 85 pounds; females tend to stand 23 inches high and weigh about 75 pounds. However, it's not unusual for a well-muscled adult to top 100 pounds. In rare instances, so-called ""giant"" versions top 140 pounds, but the Malamute body is not designed to carry excess weight.","Alaskan Malamutes will win you over with their playful, outgoing dispositions. They greet everyone as a friend—even strangers and first-time house guests—so they don't make good watchdogs, but they are extremely loyal to their family and friends. Malamutes are pack animals, and they enjoy spending time with their human pack, insisting on being included in all activities that their family undertakes. They're not big-time barkers, but they do howl and they're known for making a characteristic ""woo woo"" sound.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. You may wish to adopte the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet a dog before adopting to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up, though that's not always an option if the puppy comes from a shelter or rescue.Like every dog, Alaskan Malamutes need early socialization—exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences—when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Malamute puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking them to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help them polish their social skills.","Malamutes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Malamutes will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Some Malamutes suffer from hip dysplasia , elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, or von Willebrand's disease. Here is some more info on possible conditions you might see in Malamutes:Cataracts: Usually present by 1 to 2 years of age, known as juvenile cataracts. This type of cataract rarely progresses to blindness. Affected animals should not be used for breeding.Chondrodysplasia: This genetic disorder causes puppies to be born with deformities evident in the abnormal shape and length of their limbs. It's commonly referred to as ""dwarfism."" There is now a genetic screening test to determine if the dog carries the gene for this condition.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Hypothyroidism: This condition is often misdiagnosed because tests to evaluate the condition are not specific and can be inaccurate. Hypothyroidism is the result of abnormally low production of the thyroid hormones. Clinical signs vary depending on the severity of each case, but can include dry, coarse, and/or sparse coat, eye discharge, pale mucous membranes, and mental dullness. Hypothyroidism can be managed well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life.Inherited Polyneuropathy: This is generally characterized by a lack of coordination and instability that leads to a labored gait described as a bunny-hopping gait. The condition varies from mild to severe. An affected dog may fall down, walk on the tops of his feet, or his gait may just look a little off. Onset is usually quite sudden with most cases noted at approximately one year of age.Hemeralopia (Day Blindness): This usually begins to show when the puppy is eight weeks old and can be recognized easily by observant owners. Affected dogs bump into or stumble over things. They may be reluctant to come out into sunlight, preferring to stay in shaded areas. They seem to be feeling their way when negotiating steps into the house or disoriented when facing the sun. All these signs of clumsiness disappear at night. Hemeralopia can be managed to help the dog have an acceptable quality of life.","This member of the Working Group of dogs is definitely a task seeker. They thrive on long walks, hikes (while carrying a backpack), skijoring (pulling a person on skis), carting, and sledding. They need to run, play, and generally bounce around a lot. Inadequate exercise will cause the Alaskan Malamute to become bored and destructive. Make sure, however, that the exercise matches the dog's age, health condition, and activity level.Malamutes love to dig. Rather than trying to stop this behavior, your best bet is to accommodate it by giving your Malamute his own place to dig in the yard, such as a sandbox or other area that you don't mind setting aside for them.Blessed with a dense double coat, Alaskan Malamutes can tolerate living outdoors in extremely cold climates. However, they do need adequate shelter and a fenced enclosure, preferably with a roof over it. Because Malamutes have an extremely high pack drive, they are happiest when residing with their pack in the house. They do well living inside a home because they keep their coats clean and are easy to housetrain.Not surprisingly, Malamutes are sensitive to heat. They're Arctic dogs, not designed by nature to live in hot, humid environments. If your Malamute lives in the Sunbelt, be sure to provide them with plenty of shade, fresh water, and air conditioning during the summer, and avoid exercise in the heat of the day.Due to their size, strength, and smarts, it's highly recommended that Malamutes be enrolled in obedience training at a young age before they are large enough and strong enough to outmaneuver—or outwit—their humans.",An Alaskan Malamute diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Malamute and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"The Alaskan Malamute sports a dense double coat. The thick, coarse outer coat, known as the guard coat, should not be soft or long. The undercoat is one to two inches deep. It's oily and woolly to repel wetness and cold.The coat length increases around the shoulders and neck, down the back, over the rump, and in the breeches (the furry covering over the thigh, which resembles pants) and plume of the tail. Speaking of the tail, some display a ""cork-screw"" appearance that enables the dog to place their tail over their nose to keep them warm during cold weather.This breed's coat colors range from light gray to black, sable, and shades of sable to red. The underbelly should be predominantly white along with the feet, parts of the legs, and part of the face markings. The only solid color you'll see is white. Some Malamutes may have an attractive white blaze on the forehead or around the neck.If you share your life with an Alaskan Malamute, expect your vacuum cleaner to get a regular workout and to schedule time for regular brushing sessions. Brushing one to three times weekly helps to keep the coat clean and distribute skin oils. Malamutes shed heavily twice a year, and the hair falls out in large clumps. At that time, frequent brushing with a slicker brush and/or undercoat rake helps keep the flurry of hair under control.One plus for this shedding breed is that the double coat is odorless. In addition, Malamutes have a cat-like tendency to keep their coats clean. Baths are rarely needed, usually one to two a year unless the dog gets into a smelly mess.Brush your Malamute's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding, and your dog may not cooperate the next time they see the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Their ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Malamute to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. Handle their paws frequently—dogs are touchy about their feet—and look inside their mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Malamutes are patient with children and love the attention they get from them, but fast-growing, energetic Alaskan Malamute puppies can easily overpower a young child under age five. In their exuberance, they can knock a child over.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.With early socialization and training, your Malamute should get along well with other dogs. He may chase small animals such as cats unless brought up with them and taught not to. It's vital to properly introduce them to other animals in the household and supervise their interactions. They'll consider outdoor cats and other small animals fair game.","Malamutes are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Malamutes in need of adoption and or fostering and a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Malamute rescue.Alaskan Malamute Assistance League","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Alaskan Malamute.Alaskan Malamute Club of America, Inc."

They are not well-suited for apartment life and prefer a large, fenced-in yard to roam around.Their appearance often gets them confused with the Dogo Argentino, which is a separate breed entirely. They may also be confused with American Pit Bull Terriers, though the American Bulldog tends to be quite a bit larger.American Bulldogs can be suspicious of strangers and territorial, which can make them good watchdogs. They require socialization training so they know how to behave around invited guests.","This breed stands quite a bit taller than the English or French Bulldogs. Adorable American Bulldog puppies will grow to 20 to 28 inches in height and 60 to 120 pounds by the time they reach adulthood.Although these sizes are considered to be standard for the breed, American Bulldogs can be quite a bit larger or smaller.","American Bulldogs are friendly, intelligent, and affectionate, though that affectionate nature often leads them to be territorial and overly suspicious of strangers. This makes them lovely family dogs and watchdogs, even for families with children, but they will need socialization training, especially as puppies to get along with unfamiliar humans or other dogs that stop by for a visit. Luckily, their intelligence makes them highly adaptable and trainable.The American Bulldog is a playful breed that has some high exercise needs, and they do well in families that are able to stay active with lots of walks and play time. They aren't the best breed to be kept in apartments or small spaces that don't allow for them to burn off energy. When they aren't physically or mentally stimulated, they can become destructive and chew on things they aren't supposed to.","The American Bulldog is generally a healthy breed with a life expectancy of 10 to 16 years. Some are predisposed to certain medical conditions such as cataracts, mange, or hypothyroidism. If they suffer from obesity early in life, they may develop hip or elbow dysplasia.The breed is somewhat brachycephalic, meaning they have short snouts. This may make it more difficult for them to tolerate hot weather, especially while exercising. It is important to make sure they have enough water and monitor them and make sure they are not struggling to breathe.","Most of the care that is necessary for the health of an American Bulldog is meeting their needs for exercise and mental stimulation. Failing to do so can result in anxiety, boredom, and destructive behavior. So long as those needs are met, the rest is fairly standard.Maintain normal vet visits, check their ears weekly, keep up with monthly nail clipping and normal dental care. One of the issues you may face is the potential for drooling that is common among bully breeds. You should take care to wipe your dog as needed unless you want a generous amount of slobber all over your home.","An American Bulldog diet should be formulated for a large to giant breed, and their high energy level should be taken into consideration. Their needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood.It is best to ask your veterinarian or professional nutritionist about your dog's specific nutritional requirements. You should discuss with them how to form an appropriate diet for your dog.","American Bulldogs can come in several different colors. Traditionally they are white with patches of brindle, red, or black, but there are quite a few more color variations to the breed in modern times. They may have patterns that include shades of black, red, brindle, brown, or fawn.American Bulldogs usually have black on the nose and the rims of the eyes, but they may also have shades of pink. Their eye color is usually brown. Although these are breed standards, some American Bulldogs have been known to be merle or have coats that contain shades of blue.American Bulldogs have a short coat that sheds moderately throughout the year, and they don't require extensive grooming. Weekly brushing should keep it under control with baths as needed.","As with most breeds, socialization training should begin early for American Bulldogs. So long as they are trained properly, American Bulldogs are great with children and are very loyal to all members of the family. It is also important to train children on how to properly handle and treat animals to avoid incident. Even with properly trained dogs, you should always supervise them when they play with children to make sure things don't get out of hand. American Bulldogs are large animals, and overly energetic play can cause injuries.The same can be said for interactions with other pets. So long as American Bulldogs are socialized and trained, they usually get along with other dogs just fine. Play should be supervised, especially with smaller dogs that can easily get hurt when playing with a large, muscular American Bulldog. Generally, this breed is friendly, but injuries can happen when they are too eager to play rough or don't know their own strength.","If you'd like to adopt an American Bulldog, you can check out American Bulldog Rescue, a non-profit group that specifically tries to find home for dogs of this breed.

They thrive on activity. Plan on keeping your Eskie busy with training classes, games, romps at a dog park, or hikes. A busy Eskie is unlikely to become bored — a state you want to avoid with this breed, because boredom leads to excessive barking, inappropriate chewing, and other annoying behaviors.The Eskie needs to be with his family, so don't plan on leaving him alone for long periods at a time, or he may develop separation anxiety.If you are a confident leader, you'll enjoy life with an Eskie. If you're not, you're apt to have an Eskie that's leading you.Do not trust even a well-trained and well-socialized Eskie with small pets such as birds, hamsters, and gerbils. Chances are, he will succumb to his instincts and give chase.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.","The American Eskimo Dog comes in three sizes: Toy, Miniature, and Standard. Toys stand 9 to 12 inches and weigh about 10 pounds. Miniatures stand 12 to 15 inches and weigh about 20 pounds. Standards stand 15 inches to 19 inches and weigh about 30 pounds.","Not only does the American Eskimo Dog have a winning look, but he's also got a winning personality. He's spunky, clever, plays hard, and loves vigorous exercise. Because he is naturally suspicious of strangers, he makes an excellent watchdog.Eskies must have regular opportunities to vent their energy and use their busy minds. Otherwise, they can be rambunctious and bored, which usually leads to barking and chewing. A bored American Eskimo Dog can wreak havoc on your home and yard.The strong-willed Eskie also needs a confident owner who can take charge in teaching and leading him. He learns quickly, however, so training is fun and highly successful.Don't plan on leaving this breed alone too much. He loves being part of a family and can suffer separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time. When you are away from home, it is wise to leave the Eskie in a crate or kennel, with sturdy chew toys, to keep him occupied and out of trouble until you return home.","Not all American Eskimo Dogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This malady involves the hip joint. If your Eskie has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This family of eye diseases involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Juvenile Cataracts: This condition can be a problem for some relatively young (less than six years old) Eskies. This is thought to be hereditary. When buying an American Eskimo Dog puppy, be sure to ask the breeder if her stock is certified by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation, and ask to see the certificates.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Eskies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","Though he does well just about anywhere, it should comes as no surprise that the American Eskimo Dog loves cold climates. One of the joys of owning an Eskie is watching him play in the snow, which most Eskies love and will play in for hours. Many also enjoy water play.The Eskie does well in a variety of homes, from apartments to large houses with yards — as long as he's an indoor dog. This breed isn't suited for life in the backyard. He's happiest when he's with his family.American Eskimo Dogs need a lot of exercise. They are indeed large dogs in small packages, and they can become destructive if they don't get regular exercise. They do well in busy households because their energy helps them keep up with everyone.Separation anxiety can be a concern for both Eskie and owner. The best way to deal with this problem is to avoid it altogether. Don't leave the dog alone for long periods of time and, when you do leave him, put him in a crate with plenty of sturdy toys to keep him occupied.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Eskie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The white, fluffy American Eskimo Dog has a double coat with a dense undercoat and a longer outer coat. The hair is straight with no curl or wave. He has a pronounced ruff around the neck. His front and rear legs are well feathered, and the fur on his tail is profuse. He is most often pure white, or white and cream.Eskies shed a lot, and they require frequent brushing to cut down on the amount of fur left around the house, and to prevent matting (especially behind the ears). A thorough brushing two or three times a week is advised.Despite his light coloring, the Eskie is amazingly easy to keep clean. Eskie fur contains oil, which prevents dirt from adhering to it. When an Eskie gets dirty, the dirt usually brushes right out as long as the fur is dry.Eskies should only be bathed once every couple of months, depending on how dirty they get. Being bathed too often can cause skin problems, because it tends to make an Eskie's skin dry and irritated. Unless they are very dirty, Eskies rarely have a doggie odor.Their ears should be checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection, then wiped out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with a gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner. Their toenails need trimming at least once a month.","The Eskie is an excellent family dog who's affectionate with everyone, including kids of all ages, other dogs, and cats. Of course, adults should always supervise interactions between kids and dogs; the Eskie's high energy level can be overwhelming to extremely young children, so supervision is especially important.The Eskie does not receive high marks for living in peace with small mammals and birds, which he tends to chase.","American Eskimo Dogs are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you're interested in adopting an Eskie, a rescue group is a good place to start.Heart Bandits, the American Eskimo Dog Rescue","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the American Eskimo.American Eskimo Dog Club of America"

Once he has decided to follow one, you'll have a difficult time calling him off.Foxhounds aren't homebodies and will roam if given the chance.Foxhounds are extremely active and need one to two hours a day of exercise. Take them on long, meandering walks with lots of sniffing time or take them on a run with you.Foxhounds aren't suited to living in cramped quarters; they need a large yard or, better yet, an acre or two.Foxhounds love to eat and easily gain weight if their food intake isn't strictly controlled.Foxhounds can be stubborn and independent, making training a challenge. Obedience training is important, however, to develop a better relationship with your dog and establish your position as leader of the pack.Foxhounds are gentle and tolerant and love children. They enjoy the company of other dogs and can learn to get along with cats if introduced to them at an early age.",Males are 22 inches to 25 inches tall and weigh 45 to 65 pounds; females are 21 inches to 24 inches tall and weigh 40 to 60 pounds.,"While they're mainly sweet and easygoing, American Foxhounds have the independent and stubborn nature that's common to hounds. They've been bred to hunt with very little direction from their human companions, and they don't necessarily see why they should have to do things your way.Foxhounds who've been raised in the company of other dogs, rather than with a human family, can be challenging because they've bonded more with their pack than with people. They'll need more time, attention, and training to help them get used to life as a family dog.Like every dog, Foxhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, dogs, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps a Foxhound puppy grow up to be a friendly, well-rounded dog.","This is typically a healthy breed and isn't known to have any hereditary illnesses. On rare occasions, an American Foxhound may have the following condition:Thrombocytopathy is caused by poorly functioning platelets and results in abnormal or excessive bleeding from minor bumps or cuts. The treatment is based on the cause and severity of condition.","Bred to be a fast hunter who can run for miles, the American Foxhound needs a substantial amount of exercise. If he's not going to be a hunting companion, he'll need daily runs or some other form of exercise to help him burn off his natural energy. He's best suited to a home with a yard — or better yet, an acre or two; he's probably too loud for condo or apartment living.Often raised in outdoor kennels with a pack of dogs, the American Foxhound is used to roughing it, and can live outdoors if he's got a good shelter and another social dog to keep him company. If he's an only dog, however, he should live indoors with his human pack so he won't get lonely.Obedience training is highly recommended to help the independent Foxhound view you as leader of the pack. He won't respond well to punishment-based training, so use treats and praise to reward him for doing as you ask. And ""ask"" is the operative word. Hounds will flat-out ignore you if you try to boss them around. Keep an old Southern adage in mind when training an American Foxhound: you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of a high-quality dog food a day.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Hounds like to eat. To help prevent obesity, measure your Foxhound's food before you serve it and give meals twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. You should be able to see a waist when you look down at him. Do the hands-on test periodically to make sure your dog's in good shape: place your hands over his body, thumbs along the spine and fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel his ribs beneath a layer of muscle. If they're buried beneath rolls of fat, your dog needs more exercise and less food.For more on feeding your American Foxhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","American Foxhounds have a medium-length coat that lies close to the body and has a hard texture, protecting the hound from brush and briars in the field. The coat comes in many colors; as the saying goes, no good hound is a bad color.American Foxhounds are a brush-and-go breed. A once-over with a firm bristle brush once a week removes dirt and distributes the skin oils that keep the coat healthy. You don't need to bathe your Foxhound regularly — only when you notice a strong doggy smell or he's gotten into something grimy.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene. Brush your Foxhound's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog's feet in good condition and protect your legs from getting scratched when your Foxhound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Start getting your Foxhound used to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience, filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy vet exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","American Foxhounds are patient and loving with children, and it's not unusual to hear of a child learning to walk by holding onto the family Foxhound. That said, as with any breed, you should never leave a dog and a young child alone together. They should always be supervised to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling, by either party.Bred for living in large packs, American Foxhounds are always happy to have the company of other dogs. A bored hound will find ways to entertain himself — destructive ways that you won't like — so if no one's home during the day, it's best if he has at least one canine buddy.American Foxhounds can get along well with cats, rabbits, and other pets if they're raised with them in the home.

Confident and keenly aware of their surroundings, they are watchdogs in that they may alert you to the presence of strangers, but that's primarily because they're eager to greet ""their"" guests.While their love of people makes them failures as guard dogs, their courage is unmatched and they will defend their family with their lives.Like every dog, American Pit Bull Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your your puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","American Pit Bull Terriers are generally healthy, but as with all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all American Pit Bulls Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia (HD): This condition is a malformation of the hip joint ball and socket. It can be extremely painful depending on the severity of the condition. Dogs who are going to be bred should have x-rays of their hips done at 2 years of age to ensure they do not have this condition.Allergies: Allergies are quite common in APBT/AmStaffs. Skin allergies are typically caused by such environmental allergens as fleas, grass, pollen, and dust.They can also be food related, but this is less common. Common food allergens include beef, rice, wheat, and corn. Allergies can cause intense itching and discomfort, which means dogs will dig and chew sometimes till they bleed. This is risky because secondary infections can develop in the damaged tissue. To treat allergies, the cause must be identified and removed from the dog's environment if possible. A veterinarian can help you with this, as well as let you know which allergy symptoms can be controlled with medication.Hypothyroidism: This is a dysfunction of the thyroid gland that causes weight gain, poor coat, reproductive problems and other issues. It usually occurs in middle-aged dogs and can be controlled with daily medication that must continue throughout the dog's life.Heart Disease: Heart disease affects these dogs in several forms, with aortic stenosis being most common. Aortic stenosis is a congenital heart defect, meaning it's something the dog is born with. It's an abnormal narrowing of the connection between the left ventricle and the aorta. Some dogs don't have any signs or only minor signs, while others may have little energy or even die suddenly. If your veterinarian hears a heart murmur, a chest x-ray and electrocardiogram can confirm the diagnosis.","Expect to spend about an hour a day walking, playing with or otherwise exercising this dog. While they love people, American Pit Bull Terriers are strong for their size and can be stubborn if left to their own devices. Begin obedience training early and continue it throughout the dog's life. Training is the foundation for a strong relationship with your American Pit Bull Terrier.American Pit Bull Terriers should not be left outside for long because they can't tolerate the cold well. Even regardless the climate, these dogs do best as housedogs. They form strong attachments to their families and will suffer if left alone for long periods.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.To prevent obesity, measure your dog's food and give meals at set times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs beneath a layer of muscle but not see them. If the ribs are buried beneath rolls of fat, your dog needs to go on a diet.For more on feeding your American Pit Bull Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The short coat is shiny and stiff to the touch, and comes in all colors — red, blue, brown, grey, black and white, and brindle, among them.They require little grooming, and have a coat that's easy to keep clean with the occasional bath. Brushing with a stiff brush and wiping down with a cloth will maintain the coat's shine.Brush your dog's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Accustom your American Pit Bull Terrier to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","American Pit Bull Terriers love children, and we don't mean for breakfast. Sturdy, energetic, and tolerant, they are ideal playmates. That said, no dog of any size or breed should ever be left unsupervised with children.When no adult can be there to oversee what's going on, dogs should be crated or kenneled, especially after they reach sexual maturity, when they may begin to test the possibility of becoming ""pack"" leader.Don't allow children to pull on a dog's ears or tail. Teach them never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away.Because of their dog-fighting heritage, some American Pit Bull Terriers retain a tendency to be aggressive with other dogs, but if they are socialized early and trained to know what behavior is expected of them, that aggression can be minimized or overcome, and many are dog- and cat-friendly. Just to be safe, they should always be supervised in the presence of other pets.","You can find American Pit Bulls, and Pit Bulls, and Pit Bull mixes, in just about every shelter in the country.

Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Pugabull diet should be formulated for a medium dog with medium to high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Pugabulls dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Pugabull's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Pugabull coats are often a mix of their American Bulldog and Pug parents' coats and colors.

Some insurance companies won't cover households that have this breed. Check your local laws and insurance policy before you adopt one.American Staffordshire Terriers were used in the barbaric sports of bull-baiting and bear-baiting, and they are still used in illegal dog fighting rings to this day. This contributes to their undeserved reputation as aggressive dogs.The breed is very strong for its size and will pull on leashes when not trained properly.They prefer to have a yard with a strong, high fence so they can run around and burn off energy.The short, smooth coat of the American Staffordshire Terrier is fairly easy to groom, and the breed tends to not have a ""doggy odor,"" which means bathing is only necessary as needed.Although they can be good watchdogs through sheer intimidation, American Staffordshire Terriers are generally very friendly towards humans.","Male American Staffordshire Terriers average about 17 to 19 inches in height, while females tend to be a bit smaller at an average of 16 to 18 inches in height. The average weight for an American Staffordshire Terrier is between 40 and 60 pounds, though some can weigh more or less.","The American Staffordshire Terrier is celebrated as a family dog that loves to be around humans. American Staffordshire Terriers are never happier than when they're spending time with their families, whether its during a vigorous play session, a long walk, or just cuddling up on the couch. In fact, although they have a reputation as being guard dogs, they are likely to greet strangers with lots of licks and affection. It is mostly their muscular build and undeserved reputation as aggressive ""Pit Bulls"" that intimidates intruders and keeps them away. That said, many American Staffordshire Terrier owners claim that dogs of this breed are great judges of character and know people's intent, and they can make excellent watchdogs for that reason. American Staffordshire Terriers are intense dogs that will pull, chew, dig, and bark if they're bored. As strong, athletic dogs, they can be difficult to walk, and they'll pull their walker wherever they go if they're allowed to. They need a confident, assertive trainer who will be able to handle them on a leash, set boundaries, and give them proper mental and physical stimulation. They also require early socialization with humans and other animals. While the breed is naturally friendly to people, they can be confrontational with other dogs when they aren't socialized. American Staffordshire Terriers are intelligent, eager to please, and generally take well to training. They enjoy having a job to do, whether that's acting as a jogging buddy, doing nose work, running agility courses, or performing in other dog sports. A trainer who can meet the physical demands of the American Staffordshire Terrier and keep them busy and under control will have a devoted, affectionate, and obedient companion for life.","The American Staffordshire Terrier is generally a healthy breed, though they are predisposed to a few health problems that you should be on the lookout for. The breed is prone to skin allergies, urinary tract infections, and autoimmune diseases. They may also develop osteoarthritis or spondylosis later in life. Other health problems that American Staffordshire Terriers may develop include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, demodectic mange, cerebellar ataxia, heart disease, and luxating patella.","American Staffordshire Terriers are known to get bad breath, so their teeth should be brushed at least weekly, preferably even more frequently, to prevent bad breath germs from growing. Their nails should be trimmed as needed, which can be difficult as American Staffordshire Terriers tend to not like to have their paws touched. Training them early to be comfortable with touching and grooming will help. Their ears should be checked for wax buildup and debris weekly and cleaned as needed to avoid ear infection or pest infestation. Keep up with regular veterinary checkups and follow your veterinarian's advice for additional at-home care.","American Staffordshire Terriers should be given a diet formulated for a mid-to-large size dog with moderate energy levels. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your American Staffordshire Terrier and what size portions they require. Their needs will change with age, so be sure to make adjustments from puppyhood to adulthood and old age as recommended.","The short, smooth coat of the American Staffordshire Terrier can come in a variety of colors, including blue, fawn, white, black, and red. They can include a mix of white and other colors or a mix of white and brindle. It is considered a fault by the AKC if more than 80 percent of the coat is white. The stiff, glossy hair of the American Staffordshire Terrier sheds heavily twice a year as the seasons change and sheds minimally the rest of the year. It should be brushed at least weekly, which will help capture some of the shedding fur and keep the coat shiny. Bathing is only necessary as needed, which shouldn't be more than a few times a year unless dogs get dirty. Generally, this breed doesn't have much of a ""doggy odor"" and can go without a bath for some time. Overall, American Staffordshire Terriers' grooming needs are fairly low.","American Staffordshire Terriers are known for being loving family dogs, even with children. That said, they are best suited to homes with kids over the age of six. This breed is very muscular and can play rough, which might result in injuries. Young kids like to poke and prod, so it is especially important to train them on how to handle animals. Even with properly trained dogs of any breed, play time with children should always be supervised. American Staffordshire Terriers are not generally fond of other dogs. They were originally bred to fight, and though many breeders have worked to remove these tendencies over the years, the breed can still be standoffish. Meeting other dogs in public can be a hit-or-miss situation with each individual dog. Additionally, American Staffordshire Terriers may see other pets like cats as prey. Early socialization and growing up with other animals can reduce the American Staffordshire Terrier's tendencies to not get along well with other pets, but they may be best suited to one pet households.","If you're interested in an American Staffordshire Terrier, you should check out rescues near you that specialize in Pit Bull breeds.

Give him one to two hours a day of walks, runs, or games of fetch. You can break up exercise periods throughout the day — an hour here, a half hour there. Without it they may express their pent-up energy with recreational barking and excessive chewing.The AWS craves companionship, and if you leave him alone for more than a few hours, he may express his boredom and loneliness in destructive ways. The AWS is best suited for homes where someone's home during the day.American Water Spaniels can be stubborn and manipulative. You must show them that you mean what you say by establishing rules and being consistent in enforcing them.American Water Spaniels like to roam and may leave your yard or your side to go hunting on their own if they're not confined by a fence or restrained by a leash.AWS's may become one-person dogs but will be friendly toward family members. Don't expect them to fawn over visitors or strangers, though.Harsh treatment can make your AWS timid or stubborn. The breed responds best to a gentle touch and training techniques that use rewards for getting it right, rather than punishment for getting it wrong.Some American Water Spaniels are territorial and aggressive with strange dogs, although they get along with other family dogs and pets.They have a natural tendency for chewing, digging, and jumping, but you can overcome these behaviors with training.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Males and females are 15 to 18 inches tall. Females tend to be slightly smaller than males, with females weighing 25 to 40 pounds and males weighing 35 to 45 pounds.","The American Water Spaniel is lively, alert, friendly, and obedient, as long as you provide fair, consistent training and leadership. Without it, he can become stubborn and manipulative. Make sure your training methods use rewards rather than punishment, though; when treated harshly the AWS can become sulky or timid.He likes human companionship and may become a barker if he's home alone and gets bored. This isn't a dog you can leave alone for hours in the backyard. And although he makes a good family dog, he's likely to bond most strongly with whoever gives him the most time and attention.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the AWS needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your AWS puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","American Water Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all American Water Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In American Water Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: A degenerative disease in which the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development. This disease is found in many breeds of dogs, not just the American Water Spaniel.Growth Hormone-Responsive Dermatitis: Causes skin changes due to a lack of growth hormone (somatropin). This hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland and is necessary for hair growth. Affected animals have varying degrees of hair loss but are otherwise healthy. The mode of inheritance is unknown. The condition is more common in male dogs between 1 and 5 years of age, with hair loss starting at puberty. The hair loss is symmetrical over dog's body, and the skin is markedly darker in color due to increased pigmentation. Without treatment, hairlessness and hyper pigmentation will eventually spread over the body except for the head and feet. It can be treated with growth hormone, but this is an expensive treatment and difficult to obtain. Neutering may resolve the condition in male dogs.Pattern Baldness (Saddle Alopecia): This condition causes a gradual, symmetric thinning and loss of hair (alopecia) that usually begins by 6 to 9 months of age and progresses until affected areas are completely bald. Saddle alopecia causes hair loss underneath the neck, on the back of the thighs, and on the tail. Method of inheritance is not known. There is no treatment to cover the hair loss.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. They eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract.Retinal Dysplasia: Retinal Dysplasia is an abnormal development of the retina resulting in retinal folds. This can lead to a variety of vision problems for the dog ranging from a small blind spot to total blindness. It's most commonly seen as a hereditary disease, but a number of environmental factors including trauma can also cause it. There is no known treatment for Retinal Dysplasia but many dogs with it live full lives, their other senses compensating for the visual impairment.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. Contact allergies are also treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder that affects many breeds. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist.Epilepsy: A disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of hormone produced from the thyroid gland, which is found in the neck. The mild symptoms of the disease may be infertility. The more apparent signs of this disease are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels of energy, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires a lifetime of treatment. A dog that is having daily treatment can live a full and happy life.","If he gets lots of exercise and playtime, the American Water Spaniel can do well in smaller living situations such as an apartment or condominium, but he's a country dog at heart, and is happiest when he's got plenty of open space to run off his natural energy.Smart and trainable, the AWS responds best to short, motivational training sessions. Avoid heavy-handed techniques that use punishments for getting it wrong instead of rewards for getting it right — they could make him sulky or withdrawn. And train him yourself rather than sending him off to be tutored by a stranger. He'll work much better for someone he knows and loves.He may chew when his people aren't home, so crate training is a must to keep your possessions safe and your AWS out of the doghouse.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your AWS in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your AWS, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","This is what's known as a double-coated dog. A dense undercoat protects the American Water Spaniel against weather, water, and scratchy underbrush. The outer coat may have uniform waves — called a marcel coat — or tight curls. The amount of curl or wave can vary from one area of the dog's body to another. The forehead is covered with short, smooth hair, and moderate feathering adorns the tail and legs.An AWS coat can be solid liver, brown, or dark chocolate, and will occasionally have a small amount of white on the toes or chest.Some hunters clip the coat to make it easier to remove burrs. Family dogs can be left au naturel, or you may want to trim the coat or shave the ears to neaten the dog's look. The coat is naturally oily to help with water resistance, so be prepared for oily spots on your wall or furniture if the dog rubs up against them.Brush the coat weekly to keep it in good shape.Water Spaniels shed in the spring, but frequent brushing will help keep too much loose hair from piling up on your carpets and furniture. Frequent baths will remove the coat's natural oils and diminish its ability to repel water and keep the dog warm, so bathe him only when he's dirty or smelly and really needs it.All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your AWS's ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your AWS may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your AWS's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your AWS enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your AWS to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The American Water Spaniel is gentle with children. Nonetheless, as with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away.

Untrained and un-socialized Anatolian Shepherds can become overprotective, aggressive, and uncontrollable.Anatolian Shepherds are independent and less eager to please than other breeds. They won't not necessarily wait for instructions but will act if they think their ""flock"" is threatened.Secure fencing is an abolute must.Some Anatolians are champion diggers.As guardians of their territory, some can be barkers, especially at night.Some Anatolians can be dog-aggressive.They shed profusely, especially in the spring.Expect a challenge for leadership at some point with the Anatolian Shepherd. Owners must be willing to exercise pack authority consistently and kindly.Because they are so large, expect high costs for boarding, medications, and food purchases; you'll also need a large vehicle for them.Anatolian Shepherd Dogs are sensitive to anesthesia. Discuss this with your veterinarian before any surgical procedures.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a good shelter or rescue that will vaccinate, provide veterinary care, and require applicants to meet with dogs beforehand to make sure they are a good match.",Males stand 29 inches tall and weigh 110 to 150 pounds. Females stand 27 inches tall and weigh 80 to 120 pounds.,"The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is highly intelligent, independent, and dominant. They think for themselves—a necessary characteristic for a livestock guardian. They're very protective of their family and flock, and they consider themselves to be constantly on duty.Though protective, the Anatolian Shepherd is calm, friendly, and affectionate with their immediate family. They are not friendly with strangers and are very reserved with those outside their family, even if they're friends or relatives of yours.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. If you want to adopt, you may prefer to choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up their littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when they grow up, though that may not be possible if you are adopting from a shelter or rescue.Like every dog, the Anatolian Shepherd needs early socialization—exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences—when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Anatolian Shepherd puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly and taking your dog to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help them polish their social skills.","Anatolian Shepherds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Anatolian Shepherds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.In Anatolian Shepherds, you may see conditions like hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, or von Willebrand's disease. Here is some more information about conditions that may appear in dogs of this breed:Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Demodectic Mange: Also called demodicosis, this malady is caused by the demodex mite. The mite can't be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother can pass this mite to her pups, which usually happens in their first few days of life. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause any problems. If your dog has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, they can develop demodectic mange. This disorder can be localized, occurring as patches of red, scaly, skin with hair loss on the head, neck and forelegs. It's thought of as a puppy disease and often clears up on its own. The generalized form covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. In either case, you should take your dog to the vet for a checkup and treatment. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs who develop generalized demodectic mange, because it carries a genetic link.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Entropion: Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, which usually affects the lower eyelids of both eyes. It is irritating and causes impairment of vision. It generally occurs before a dog turns a year old, but treatment should be held off until the dog reaches adulthood. Treatment consists of multiple surgeries performed over time so that the dog isn't at risk for ectropion, which is a rolling out of the eyelid.","The Anatolian Shepherd is a hardy dog and can adapt to living outdoors, indoors, or both. They do not do well living in a kennel or at the end of a chain, however. They should be kept in a securely fenced yard—a fence at least six feet tall is required for this big breed—not only for their protection, but also for the protection of dogs or people who might inadvertently enter their turf, which they will defend with all their might.Because they are naturally wary of new people, animals, and situations, the Anatolian Shepherd must be socialized right from puppyhood. Obedience training and consistent leadership are also essential, because the Anatolian is so strong-willed. This dog has their own ideas, and they won't cater to their owner's every whim.The Anatolian Shepherd will guard and protect without any protection training; in fact, attack training is not recommended for this breed. Their protective nature grows as they matures; by the time they're about 18 months old, they usually voluntarily take on the role of guardian.",An Anatolian Shepherd Dog diet should be formulated for a large- to giant-sized breed with average energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Anatolian Shepherd and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"The Anatolian Shepherd Dog's coat is short (about an inch long) with a thick undercoat. Sometimes there is feathering on the ears, legs, and tail. Their coat comes in many colors, including pinto, white, and brindle, but fawn with a black mask is common.The Anatolian Shepherd is naturally clean, so they're no big handful in the grooming department. The breed's short coat requires minimal brushing, but you can expect profuse shedding several times year. Extra brushing during those times helps remove dead hair. Minimal bathing, three to four times a year, is all that's needed.Brush your Anatolian Shepherd's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding, and your dog may not cooperate the next time they see the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Their ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Anatolian Shepherd to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. Handle their paws frequently—dogs are touchy about their feet—and look inside their mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Anatolian Shepherd is loving with family, including the children, with whom they're calm and protective. But because of their large size, they're probably better suited to families with older children. They're unlikely to respect young children as leaders, so all interactions between the Anatolian and children should be supervised by responsible adults.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The best chance of the Anatolian Shepherd accepting other dogs and pets is to raise them with them from puppyhood. As they grow, they'll naturally accept them as part of their ""flock.""","Anatolian Shepherds are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Anatolian Shepherds in need of adoption and/or fostering, and a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They are not purebreds like their Corgi or Australian Shepherd parents.Auggies are often tri-colored, but they can also have just two colors or even one. Their coats are typically a combination of black, tan, brown, and white.These dogs shed moderately most of the year, but when the seasons change for winter and summer, they shed quite a bit while growing in their new coats.","Auggies are generally considered medium-sized dogs. This can vary, especially based on the size of the Australian Shepherd--standard or miniature. Also, if this is a second generation Auggie, or if the Corgi is also particularly small, you could even end up with a small dog. However, in general, you are looking at a medium-sized dog.The height of an Auggie is typically between ten and 13 inches, and the weight is generally between 20 and 30 pounds.","Auggies have that great happy-go-lucky, friendly, energetic, ""So excited to see you!"" personality that many people commonly associate with dogs. Spunky and playful, they love being around people and other animals.As with many dogs with high intelligence, the flip side is a bit of stubbornness and strong will--knowing their own mind, per se. However, they are quite trainable, so early training and socialization should help them learn how to work best with your family.Auggies will want to be around their family all the time and see exactly what they're up to--they are highly curious. They will want to ""help"" you with their herding ways, so just be prepared for some nose bumps and other cute guidance. They might also bark a lot--their way of being helpful and alerting you. But again, this can be curbed with early training.Auggies are very affectionate and loyal. They're friendly, but they might be a little shy around strangers, at first.","Both Australian Shepherds and Corgis are pretty healthy breeds, so the Auggie is pretty healthy overall, too. However, there are some health conditions these dogs can be prone to, which is one reason why annual vet check-ups are so important to maintain optimal health.Some of the more common health issues Auggies suffer from include:ObesityEpilepsyDeafnessBlindnessBack problems (the Corgi's long spine and stout body, mixed with a propensity for obesity from over-eating, is the source of spine risks)Urinary stonesJoint dysplasiaDrug sensitivityOther eye problemsDegenerative myelopathyVon Willebrand's DiseaseProgressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)","As with all dogs, keeping up with annual vet check-ups is important to detect any health issues early. Your vet can also help you develop a plan of care to keep your Auggie in prime health.Auggies are extremely active, energetic, curious dogs, and they will need lots of exercise and play. This is great news, because they can also be prone to weight gain, thanks to their Corgi genes, so lots of exercise will help to keep that weight off.Preventing weight gain is especially important for this breed, because the elongated spine and stout legs from their Corgi side--that your Auggie will likely exhibit, to some extent--makes the spine more delicate and easy to injure, especially if carrying around extra weight.In general, checking ears and teeth regularly will keep up your Auggie's best health. Brush their teeth two to three times a week. Clipping nails one to two times per month is also ideal. Besides shedding, Auggies are fairly low-maintenance for their care routine.","An ideal Auggie diet should be formulated for a small- to medium-sized breed with high energy. The Corgi side of the Auggie has a tendency to overeat, leading to obesity, so be careful to give a regimented amount of food. They can also be sensitive to different foods and develop allergies, so take note of your Auggie's stool to see how they react to food.As with all dogs, the Auggie's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Auggie's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Auggies are often tri-colored, but they can also have just two colors or even one. Their coats are typically a combination of black, tan, brown, and white.With dense, long, silky coats, Auggies have a moderate level of shedding during most of the year, but when the seasons change for winter and summer, they shed quite a bit while growing in their new coats. Daily brushing will help avoid tangles and mats in their longer fur, and it will also reduce the amount of hair around your house. Bathing is only needed once every few months.Because their coats change twice a year, they do pretty well in both hot and cold temperatures, but it also means they don't do excellently in either--they are pretty moderate with temperature tolerance, so be sure to watch your dog for signs of discomfort--panting and lethargy in the heat, or shivering in the cold--and take them inside if needed.","Auggies are very friendly dogs who have a naturally protective nature, due to the herding background of both parents. Extremely playful, Auggies are wonderful with children, although it's still important to use common sense when teaching children to avoid hurting the dog--pulling ears, poking eyes, etc.Auggies also get along well with other animals, as long as those animals can put up with the Auggie's natural herding instinct. Auggies may chase and herd, generally with a bump with the nose or using the body to steer the animal or person, including children. This is harmless and shouldn't cause any physical injury, but it may stress out some very small prey animals.Still, it's never a bad idea to supervise interaction between dogs with other animals or children, and even small, prey-sized animals like guinea pigs can get along with herding dogs who are trained and socialized, as you can see in many viral internet videos.As with any dog, early socialization and training are key to your Auggie living up to their full social butterfly potential. This will also help with any stubbornness they may have, though with their intelligence and trainability, this shouldn't be too difficult.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Auggies because they are a mixed breed.

He's apt to chew and tear up items he shouldn't. If you choose to live with an Australian Cattle Dog, be prepared to keep him busy — and tired. If he's tired, he's less likely to get himself into trouble.The Australian Cattle Dog is protective of what he considers his territory, and he'll defend it. He's also reserved (not necessarily unfriendly) with strangers. But he's devoted to his owner and family. Once he bonds, he likes to go wherever his owner goes; in fact, punishment to the Australian Cattle Dog is physical separation from those he loves.He's smart, but at times he can be willful and stubborn. Consistent, positive training helps control his independent streak.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Australian Cattle Dog needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Australian Cattle Dog puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Australian Cattle Dogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Australian Cattle Dogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Australian Cattle Dogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Deafness: This is an inherited condition in the Australian Cattle Dog, but it can be tested for while the puppies are very young. Deaf dogs should not be bred. Research indicates that deafness is color-linked; genes that cause pups to be born white, or with white hairs in the coat that cause a roaning pattern, are linked to deafness. Brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) testing is useful for determining hearing problems, but it's only a tool, not a cure.","The hardworking Australian Cattle dog is best suited to an environment where he gets plenty of physical and mental stimulation. He's not well suited to living in an apartment or being left alone for long periods of time. He's destructive when bored, and he tends to chew — a lot. He needs a home with a securely fenced yard, or a country farm or ranch.If you are considering an Australian Cattle Dog, make sure you can provide him a proper outlet for his natural energy and bright mind. Because he was bred to herd and chase, that's exactly what he will do: herd and chase just about anything, including cars. If you're not a sheep or cattle farmer, consider canine sports. This dog loves the activity and challenges associated with sports.The Australian Cattle Dog needs early socialization and training. Like any dog, he can become timid if he's not properly socialized when young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Australian Cattle Dog grows up to be a well-rounded dog. His propensity to mouth, chew, nip, and bite must be handled carefully. He must be taught not to put his mouth on people, only on appropriate chew items, such as sturdy toys.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Australian Cattle Dog in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Australian Cattle Dog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Australian Cattle Dog's weather-resistant outer coat is short and straight; he has a dense undercoat. The typical Australian Cattle Dog doesn't shed year-round, but instead he ""blows"" his coat once or twice a year (think of a snowstorm). In just a few weeks, the undercoat sheds in clumps.The Australian Cattle Dog's coloring is blue or red speckle. Blue or blue-mottled includes black, blue, or tan markings on the head; partially tan on the forelegs, chest, and throat; and tan on the jaw and hind legs. Sometimes the undercoat is tan with a blue outer coat. Red speckle means red all over, including the undercoat, and sometimes including dark red markings on the head.The Australian Cattle Dog doesn't require much primping, but some grooming is necessary to keep him clean and healthy. Brush him periodically, say four times a month, to distribute oils and remove dirt. When he sheds, though, brush frequently to remove the dead hair. Bathe him as needed — basically when he's really dirty or smells bad.Brush your Australian Cattle Dog's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Australian Cattle Dog to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Australian Cattle Dog is good family dog, but he does best with children if he's raised with them and accepts them early on as members of his household. In such cases, he's very playful and protective. The breed's tendency to be mouthy — even to nip and bite — can be a problem with kids, however. He may want to herd them with sharp nips, or bite when youngsters play too roughly.An adult Australian Cattle Dog who has had little exposure to children will not know how to treat them and may be too rough. Some dogs are suspicious of children; because they don't act like adults, dogs sometimes perceive them as threatening. Most problems can be solved by carefully socializing the Australian Cattle Dog puppy to children, and by teaching him bite inhibition.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Australian Cattle Dog gets along with other dogs in his household, especially if he's been raised with them from puppyhood. However, because he is so devoted to one person in a family, there can be jealousy or squabbles between the Australian Cattle Dog and other dogs.Now, about cats and other small animals that the Australian Cattle Dog usually thinks of as prey: if he is raised with a cat or other animal from the time he's a puppy, he'll probably consider it a member of his houseshold and leave it alone. If not, he's likely to chase, catch, and even kill.","Australian Cattle Dogs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Australian Cattle Dogs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Australian Cattle Dog rescue.Australian Cattle Dog Rescue, Inc.","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Australian Cattle Dog.Australian Cattle Dog Club of America"

Their coats don't need much grooming, though they tend to shed more heavily in spring and may need more brushing at that time.Although Australian Kelpies are typically used for a specific job, they can be loving pets so long as they are well trained and given tasks to do that keep them mentally and physically stimulated.","Australian Kelpies are medium-sized dogs, typically weighing between 25 and 46 pounds. They usually measure 15 to 20 inches at the shoulder. Individuals of the breed may be smaller or larger.","Australian Kelpies have an independent streak that is very beneficial for herding work, but it also means that they need to be mentally challenged, or they may grow bored and engage in destructive behavior. Despite this independent nature, Australian Kelpies should not be left without human company for long, least of all when they are cooped up indoors. They have a sensitive side that doesn't respond well to harsh rebukes or punishment, but a competent trainer that relies on positive reinforcement will find that these dogs are more than smart enough to follow commands, even at long distances. Australian Kelpies are not overly trusting of strangers, and they are very territorial. Although this makes them great watchdogs who will bark at any sign of danger, it also means they need socialization training from an early age, and it may be best for them if neighboring pets are not allowed to wander on the property. They need to learn when it is appropriate to react with suspicion and when to allow guests to approach. Novice owners may find the exercise needs of the Australian Kelpie to be too much to handle. They need several walks, a good run each day, and mental exercises, such as learning new tricks or commands, to stay calm and happy.","The Australian Kelpie's health is generally good. The breed may be genetically predisposed to a few conditions that owners should watch out for, however. These include cryptorchidism, hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy, Collie eye anomaly, and cerebellar abiotrophy, which is a neurological condition that affects movement. These conditions are fairly uncommon, but it is important to stay vigilant and keep up with regular vet visits.","Australian Kelpies require fairly little regular care. Their nails will usually file down naturally as they walk, though they should be checked for damage and trimmed if necessary. Teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Their ears should be checked for signs of debris, parasites, or infection and kept clean. Baths should be given as needed.",An Australian Kelpie diet should be formulated for a mid-sized breed with high energy and intense exercise requirements. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Australian Kelpie and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"Australian Kelpie coats can be short, rough, or smooth and come in several different beautiful colors. They can be black, red, chocolate, black with tan markings, red with tan markings, smokey blue, or fawn. The Australian Kelpie's grooming needs are low to moderate. A brushing or two per week should help remove dead hair and reduce shedding. They often have double coats with the outer coat being more weather-resistant. Australian Kelpies tend to shed more heavily in the spring, so they may need extra brushing during that time.","The natural herding instincts of the Australian Kelpie can make it hard for them to live with small children or other pets, as they have a tendency to nip in order to round up whoever or whatever they feel needs to be herded. Their distrust of strangers may also make things difficult when children have young friends over. However, all of these tendencies can be kept under control and redirected to constructive behaviors with the right training, especially if socialization training begins early in life. If you plan to adopt an Australian Kelpie into your family, make sure you are prepared to give them the training they need to provide everyone with a safe and positive living environment, including your new pup.","If you're interested in adopting an Australian Kelpie into your family, you can check out Rescue Me! Australian Kelpie Rescue's website or find them on Facebook where they regularly post adoptable Australian Kelpies that need homes.

They need a job to do as well, such as daily obedience training or competing in herding and agility trials.Australian Shepherds can be very destructive and bark for long periods if they're not getting the exercise and mental stimulation they need.Aussies will alert bark to warn you if they see or hear something suspicious, and will protect their family and home with a surprising fierceness.Although Australian Shepherds have the reputation for needing wide-open space, they do just fine in cities if they get enough stimulation and exercise. They're not good apartment dogs, though. You'll want at least a small yard to help them get out some of their high energy.This herding dog's pushiness with livestock can carry over into the home and, with a timid or inexperienced owner, he may assume the dominant role in the family. The breed needs a firm and confident owner — Aussies probably aren't a good choice if you've never had a dog before.Australian Shepherds are average shedders, and their coat needs regular maintenance, including weekly brushing to keep it clean and prevent matting, and possibly trimming to keep it looking tidy.Aussies enjoy the company of their family and prefer to stick close to their human pack. They don't do well stuck in the backyard by themselves for long periods.Aussies are by nature standoffish with people they don't know, and unless they have regular exposure to lots of different people — ideally beginning in puppyhood — they can become fearful of strangers. This may lead to biting out of fear and aggression. Give your Aussie lots of contact with friends, family, neighbors, and even strangers to help him polish his social skills.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Slightly longer than he is tall, the Australian Shepherd stands 20 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder for males, 18 to 21 inches for females. On average, males weigh between 50 and 65 pounds, females 40 to 55 pounds.You may see advertisements for dogs called teacup, toy, or miniature Australian Shepherds. Australian Shepherd breeders don't recognize these dogs as true Australian Shepherds. The breed is meant to be a functional working dog capable of herding tough stock for miles in rough country or snowdrifts, and it has no smaller size varieties.","Bred to be pushy with livestock, Australian Shepherds can and will take the dominant role in the home if you don't give them firm and confident leadership. This makes them a poor choice for first-time or timid owners.Like many herding dogs, Australian Shepherds are by nature loyal to their family but standoffish with strangers. They need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young.Socialization helps ensure that your Aussie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.

Not all Aussies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Aussies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn't fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain.Epilepsy: The Australian Shepherd can suffer from epilepsy, which is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be treated with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder.Deafness: Deafness is fairly common in this breed and can pose many challenges. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but usually deafness cannot be cured. Living with and training a deaf dog requires patience and time, but there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier. If your Aussie is diagnosed with hearing loss or total deafness, take the time to evaluate if you have the patience, time, and ability to care for the animal. Regardless of your decision, it is best to notify the breeder.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable Aussie breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog's eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia.Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA): Collie Eye Anomaly is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and is diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. There is no treatment for CEA, but as noted above, blind dogs can get around very well using their other senses. It is important to remember that this condition is a genetic abnormality, and your breeder should be notified if your puppy has the condition. It is also important to spay or neuter your dog to prevent the gene from being passed to a new generation of puppies.Persistent Pupillary Membranes (PPM): Persistent Pupillary Membranes are strands of tissue in the eye, remnants of the fetal membrane that nourished the lenses of the eyes before birth. They normally disappear by the time a puppy is 4 or 5 weeks old, but sometimes they persist. The strands can stretch from iris to iris, iris to lens, or cornea to iris, and sometimes they are found in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye. For many dogs, the strands do not cause any problems and generally they break down by 8 weeks of age. If the strands do not break down, they can lead to cataracts or cause corneal opacities. Eye drops prescribed by your veterinarian can help break them down.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.Drug Sensitivity: Sensitivity to certain drugs is commonly seen in herding breeds, including Australian Shepherds and Collies. It is caused by a mutation of the Multidrug Resistance Gene (MDR1), which produces a protein called P-glycoprotein. This protein works as a pump to remove toxic substances from the body to prevent the harmful effects of the toxins. In dogs who show Drug Sensitivity, that gene does not function, resulting in toxicity. Dogs with this mutated gene can be sensitive to Ivermectin, a medicine commonly used in anti-parasitic products such as heartworm preventives, as well as other drugs, including chemotherapy drugs. Signs of this sensitivity range from tremors, depression, seizures, incoordination, hypersalivation, coma, and even death. There is no known treatment but there is a new genetic test that can identify dogs with this nonfunctioning gene. All Australian Shepherds should be screened.Cancer: Dogs, like humans, can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancer and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, the tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically.Nasal Solar Dermatitis: Also known as Collie-nose, this condition generally occurs in dogs who have little or no pigment in their nose and is not restricted to Collies. Dogs who are super-sensitive to sunlight develop lesions on the nose and occasionally around the eyelids, ranging from light pink lesions to ulcerating lesions. The condition may be difficult to diagnose at first because several other diseases can cause the same lesions. If your Aussie is diagnosed with Collie nose, keep him out of direct sunlight, and apply doggie sunscreen when he goes outside. The most effective way to manage the condition is to tattoo the dog's nose black so the ink serves as a shield against sunlight.Detached Retina: An injury to the face can cause the retina to become detached from its underlying supportive tissues. A detached retina can lead to visual impairment or even blindness. There is no treatment for a detached retina, but many dogs live full lives with visual impairments.","If you've got a yard, make sure you've also got a secure fence that your Aussie can't dig under or jump over. Underground electronic fencing won't work for this breed: Your Aussie's desire to go out and herd something will overcome any concern he might have about getting a mild shock. For the same reason, walk him on leash unless you're willing to train him to resist his urges.Your Aussie needs a half hour to an hour of stimulating activity every day, such as a run, a Frisbee game, or obedience or agility exercises. When you're not playing with your dog, puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes are a great way to keep that active mind occupied.Puppies don't need as much hard exercise as adults, and in fact, you shouldn't let them run them on hard surfaces such as concrete or let them do a lot of jumping until they're at least a year old. It could stress their still developing skeletal system and cause future joint problems.The Aussie habit of nipping and chasing is excellent for herding sheep but bad manners when it's applied to humans and other pets. Obedience class can help you curb your Aussie's herding behavior, and they help satisfy his need for mental stimulation and work, too.Aussies respond well to training methods that use positive reinforcement — rewards such as praise, play, and food — and are usually happy to take commands from their trainer. They just want to know who's in charge so they can do a good job for them.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Aussies in cold climates have a heavier undercoat than those who live in sunnier areas.Straight or wavy hair covers the body, with short, smooth hair on the head and ears, the front of the forelegs, and below the heels (known as the hocks in dog terms). Moderate feathering, or a longer fringe of hair, covers the back of the forelegs and the britches — the pantaloon-like fur on the upper part of the hind legs. There's long, profuse hair — which is especially thick and full in males — on the neck and chest.Australian Shepherds come in several colors: blue merle, red merle, red, tri-color (white, black, and tan), and black. A merle coat has a patchwork of dark blotches against a lighter background, so a blue merle dog has black patches on gray and a red merle dog has red patches on beige. Merles tend to become darker with age.If you're wondering whether the Australian Shepherd sheds, the answer is yes. The breed sheds year-round, but more heavily during spring as he loses his winter coat.Brush the Aussie's coat weekly, perhaps more often during shedding season, to prevent matting. Before you start brushing, spritz the coat with a dog hair conditioner diluted with water to detangle. Then, using a slicker brush, stroke in the direction the hair grows, being sure to get all the way down to the skin — don't just run it over the top of the coat. An undercoat rake is also handy for removing excess hair. Mats are common behind the ears, and you may need to work through them with a stripping comb. You can find any of these grooming tools in a good pet supply store.If you keep him brushed, your Aussie should need a bath only when he's dirty, which probably won't be more than a few times a year. Use a shampoo made for dogs to avoid drying out his skin and coat.Grooming sessions are a good time to check your dog's overall condition. Before you start brushing, check your dog for sores, rashes, dry skin, or signs of infection such as inflammation or tenderness. Check eyes for goopy discharge and ears for foreign objects such as burrs or foxtails. The coat should look shiny, not dull. A dull coat could indicate a need for a better diet or more frequent grooming.Trim nails on a regular basis to prevent painful splintering. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they're too long.You may also want to keep your Aussie looking tidy by trimming the hair on and around the ears, on the feet and between the toes, and around the tail area. If you're uncomfortable handling anything but the grooming basics, try a professional groomer.","Australian Shepherds are herding dogs and many consider kids part of their ""flock,"" so you'll need to teach your Aussie that chasing and nipping at kids to herd them isn't allowed. Once they learn this lesson, Aussies make wonderful companions for families with kids.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.They can get along with other pets, too, although they may try to herd them. This may not go over too well, especially with cats.

Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.",Both males and females stand 10 to 11 inches tall and weigh 14 to 16 pounds.,"The Aussie is a fun-loving, upbeat dog who makes a great companion for any individual or family who wants to share his energetic lifestyle. Devoted to his owners, he's happiest when he's part of daily family life. He likes to be in the house, playing with the kids, following you room to room, or shouldering his way to the front door when you greet a friend. He is clever and should be easy to train — as long as you keep him busy and never, ever bore him.","Australian Terriers are generally healthy but, like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain conditions and diseases.Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Legg-perthes causes a deformity of the hip joint ball. It starts with a decrease in the blood supply to the head of the femur bone, until the bone eventually dies off, collapses, and becomes deformed. The result is arthritis or inflammation of the hip joint. It's unclear what causes legg-perthes, but it may be inherited or related to injury. Treatment includes rest, physical therapy, and surgically removing the deformed femoral head and neck. Dogs generally do well after the surgery, and many suffer only minor lameness, particularly during weather changes.Diabetes mellitus prevents the body from regulating blood sugar levels properly. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate for the lack of glucose reaching the body's cells — but he will lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin.Allergies. Aussies can be prone to allergies (though they are common to dogs in general). There are three main types: food allergies, contact allergies (caused by a reaction to topical substances such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals), and inhalant allergies (caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew). Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Australian Terriers, it is imperative to do your research to find Aussies of good breeding, with a multitude of health tests in the breeding program to ensure you get the healthiest possible dog that you can.","The Aussie enjoys the company of his human companions and does best when living in the house, not left to his own devices in the yard — which he will dig up like a gopher if given the chance. Your flowerbeds might stand a chance if you can train him to dig only in one designated spot in the yard, but don't bet on it. Chances are he'll make up his own mind about the best digging areas.You'll be better off if you supervise him closely when he's in the yard. Don't leave him alone too long or he'll be overcome by temptation, and your tidy landscaping will be only a memory. You must also fence your backyard to live amicably with your Aussie, who will take off after any cat, rat, or rabbit he sees if he's not confined or supervised on a leash.Since all dogs in the Terrier group tend to be bossy and aggressive around other dogs, proper socialization of your Aussie puppy is a must. Regular obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is not only fun but is essential with this breed. Keep in mind, though, that the Aussie is a quick study — don't bore him by practicing the same lessons over and over.In fact, you may find that your intelligent Aussie is the type who loves progressively challenging levels of obedience classes and agility training. Motivation is key: the task at hand must be challenging and fun, and you must offer an irresistible incentive, such as treats, toys, or verbal praise. You don't work for free, and neither does the Aussie.Begin crate training when he's a puppy. This will help you housetrain him, and it provides him with a welcome refuge as well as a familiar means of safe travel when he's in the car.The spirited Aussie needs plenty of exercise — ideally, several brisk walks a day. He remains active well into his golden years.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup dry food a day.Unlike some small breeds, the Aussie is not a fussy eater. He has a hearty appetite, though he doesn't usually overeat. For more on feeding your Australian Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.","The Aussie's shaggy coat is rough to the touch, with a soft undercoat. About two inches in length over most of the body, it is longer on the chest and head. It comes in three color types: blue and tan (tan body with a blue saddle), sandy, and red.The Aussie sheds minimally, and it's easy to groom him. Brush him once a week, trim his toenails once a month, and bathe him as needed — usually every three months or so, unless he has rolled in a scent that only a dog could love. Frequent bathing isn't recommended because it softens the coarse terrier coat. While a soft coat isn't harmful to any dog and is fine for a pet, it does detract from a show Aussie's physical appearance.Check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.","The Aussie makes a wonderful family pet, well suited to families with kids. He loves to play but, like all dogs, should be properly socialized and supervised around very young children. He prefers to be with his people and can become destructive when left alone too long. He also has a penchant for chasing cats and small animals, so he isn't best suited to homes with rabbits, mice, or hamsters. However, with patient training, the Aussie can be taught to respect and leave alone the animals he lives with — but only those he lives with. He will eagerly chase the neighbor's cat or a squirrel at a park.","Australian Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and you may find Australian Terriers in need of adoption and or fostering.Australian Terrier Rescue","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Australian Terrier.Australian Terrier Club of America, Inc."

Basenjis survived for thousand of years by being independent thinkers. They see no need to obey humans. Positive training can work to an extent, but they will pick and choose when to obey.Basenjis have a strong prey drive and cannot be trusted off leash unless in a well-fenced area.Basenjis are escape artists. They will use a chain link fence as a ladder, jump up and climb over a wood fence, or bolt out open doors.Basenjis have a great deal of energy. If not provided with outlets for this they will become destructive or find other ways to burn off energy. Crating is recommended when not supervised.Basenjis consider themselves family. They cannot be left in a yard with food and water. They require a great deal of time and attention.They do not do well in homes with other small pets, as their instinct to chase may take over. If raised with cats they can do well but they're not recommended for homes with hamsters, gerbils, rats, mice, guinea pigs, birds, or ferrets.Basenjis are stubborn, and you could end up with a confused and aggressive Basenji if you try to overcome his stubbornness with force.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Males stand 17 inches at the shoulder and weigh about 24 pounds, females 16 inches and 22 pounds.","The Basenji is a hound. That means he's intelligent and independent, but also affectionate and alert. He's a sighthound, which means that motion catches his eye, and he'll chase whatever he sees that moves — cats, squirrels, rabbits. He's not the kind of dog who will obey commands instantly. He has to think about them and decide if he really wants to do what you've asked.Patience and a sense of humor are essential to living with a Basenji. He will chew up or eat whatever's left in his reach, and he's quite capable of putting together a plan to achieve whatever it is he wants, whether that's to get up on the kitchen counter or break into the pantry where the dog biscuits are stored. He can be aloof with strangers, and he shouldn't be trusted around cats or other small animals unless he's been raised with them and you're sure he recognizes them as family members. That recognition won't apply to cats or small animals he sees outdoors, however. They're fair game.Basenjis need early socialization and training. Like any dog, they can become timid if they are not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Basenji puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling your young Basenji in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking your Basenji to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.Train him with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Basenji who's treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Basenjis will develop selective hearing if there's something more exciting to pay attention to.","Basenjis are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Basenjis will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Basenjis, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Fanconi Syndrome: Fanconi syndrome is a kidney disease that affects the normal processing of sugars and proteins. The dog urinates away the protein he needs to survive. Signs include excessive thirst, excessive urination, and elevated levels of glucose in the urine. It's usually diagnosed in dogs that are 4 to 7 years old. Fanconi syndrome used to be considered fatal, but a new way to manage the disease has increased the life expectancy of dogs with this condition. There is no cure. There is also no test to determine if a dog is a carrier. Treatment is not necessarily expensive, but it is time-consuming as it involves giving your dog up to 30 pills daily. A reputable breeder should be able to show you which dogs in his bloodline have produced dogs with Fanconi Syndrome and which have not.Immunoproliferative Systemic Intestinal Disease: Commonly known as malabsorption, this condition is similar to irritable bowel disease in humans. Dogs ISID seem to have a permanent allergic reaction to the food they eat. Affected dogs will have chronic loose stools and difficulty with weight gain. Treatment includes minimizing stress, changing the diet often, and use of drugs to decrease histamine reaction. This condition has become far less common in Basenjis than in the past.Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency (Hemolytic Anemia): This is a genetic condition in which affected Basenjis have two defective genes for the production of pyruvate kinase, an enzyme required to maintain healthy red blood cells. Basenjis with this disease usually don't live much beyond their second birthday.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog's fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life.Persistent Pupillary Membrane (PPM): Persistent Pupillary Membranes are strands of tissue in the eye, remnants of the fetal membrane that nourished the lenses of the eyes before birth. They normally disappear by the time a puppy is 4 or 5 weeks old, but sometimes they persist. The strands can stretch from iris to iris, iris to lens, or cornea to iris, and sometimes they are found in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye. For many dogs, the strands do not cause any problems and generally they break down by 8 weeks of age. If the strands do not break down, they can lead to cataracts or cause corneal opacities. Eye drops prescribed by your veterinarian can help break them down.Coloboma: Coloboma is the common name to describe a gap or hole in the eye structure. The gap can occur anywhere in the eye, usually at the bottom of the eye. The condition is thought to be inherited, but no pattern has been established. Effects of the condition can be mild or severe depending on the size and location of the hole. Affected puppies must be spayed or neutered so they don't pass on the condition.Progressive Retinal Atrophy(PRA): Once a minor concern in Basenjis it has recently become more of a problem. PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Umbilical Hernia: Umbilical hernia is present at birth where abdominal fat or internal organs protrude against the abdominal wall near the umbilicus. If the hernia is small, it can be left without treatment. Some small hernias spontaneously close by the time the puppy is 6 months old and some dogs have lived with small hernias their entire lives without difficulty. Large hernias require surgery, which is often done when the dog is being spayed or neutered. Surgery is used to prevent a more serious condition where an intestine loop drops into the hernia causing life threatening ""strangulation"" of the intestine.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as letting a puppy gain too much weight too quickly or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. That's why it's sometimes diagnosed in puppies whose parents were free of the disease.","The Basenji is a hunting dog and needs daily exercise. Some Basenjis do fine with a daily walk, while others require more enthusiastic forms of exercise. Basenjis raised with children often will spend their time wearing each other out.The Basenji is not a dog who can be left unattended in the backyard. He's an accomplished escape artist, and an unwatched Basenji will soon become a missing Basenji. If you can provide him with a couple of 30-minute walks or play sessions every day, he's well suited to apartment or condo life. Always keep your Basenji on leash unless you're in a securely fenced area, and don't count on any type of fence to keep him confined. He'll use chain link as a ladder, and a wood fence is a deterrent only if you think to put the smooth side facing the yard where the dog is and then top it with an electric wire.Another feline characteristic of the Basenji is his dislike of rain. Expect him to be grumpy if you walk him when it's wet out. The only time he might enjoy getting wet is on a really hot day.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.With his lightly built body, often likened to that of a deer, the Basenji is ill suited to carry excess weight. In other words, don't let him get fat. Keep your Basenji's physique sleek by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. Giving him plenty of daily exercise should do the rest. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can't feel the ribs, he needs a little less food and a lot more exercise.For more on feeding your Basenji, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Basenji wears a short, fine coat of rich chestnut red, black, tricolor (black and chestnut), or brindle (black stripes on a chestnut background), all with white feet, chest, and tail tip. He may also have white on his legs, a white blaze running up the center of his face between his eyes, or a white collar — a white marking around his neck. You'll always see more of his primary color than white. His markings stand out clearly and never look muddy.The Basenji is cat-like in his grooming habits and keeps himself very clean. He shouldn't need a bath more than every few months. Basenjis shed — all dogs do — but the hair is so short and fine that it is not as noticeable as some other dogs' shedding fur is.Brush your Basenji's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Basenji enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Basenji to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Basenjis aren't known for being especially fond of children, but with their high energy level, they can be good companions for older children. If they're going to be around kids, it's best if they're raised with them from puppyhood. An adult Basenji who's unfamiliar with children is most suited to a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.A Basenji shouldn't be trusted around cats or other small animals unless he's been raised with them and you're sure he recognizes them as family members. That recognition won't apply to cats or small animals he sees outdoors, however. They're fair game.","Basenjis are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Basenjis in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They are not purebreds like their Basset Hound or Labrador Retriever parents.Bassadors can come in a variety of colors and patterns. If they have a yellow Lab parent, their coat may contain more yellow. If they have a black Lab parent, their coat may turn out more black. They may also have colors from their Basset Hound parent, including white, brown, and black.Many Bassadors have thick coats that protect them in cold or hot weather, though they tend to shed a lot.The Bassador temperament can vary a lot depending on whether they take after their Lab or Basset Hound parent more. Generally, they are sociable and loving.Bassadors tend to have high prey drives. They may chase after smaller pets, though with proper training, socialization, and slow introductions, they can get along with other animals.","As the Bassador is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Basset Hound and Labrador Retriever parents, you can expect Bassadors to be on the medium- to large-side.Most Bassadors weigh in between 45 to 70 pounds, and they range in height from 13 to 20 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be larger or smaller.","Bassador enthusiasts often describe their Basset Hound/Labrador Retriever mixes as excellent companion animals. They absolutely love to be around their favorite humans, and they do not tolerate being left home alone for long stretches of time.Generally, the Bassador is outgoing and friendly. If your Bassador has more Basset Hound in them than Labrador Retriever, however, they might be a little more guarded around strangers. Of course, early socialization and training can help make any Bassador more sociable.Both the Labrador Retriever and the Basset Hound have relatively strong prey drives. If you have cats or any other animals in the house, it may take training for them and your Bassador to be friendly with each other.The Bassador's higher prey drive also means they will do pretty much anything to follow a scent, and that includes digging under a fence or tugging on their leash. Of course, proper training can help curb any unwanted prey drive-related behaviors.","The Bassador breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Basset Hound and Labrador Retriever also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Bassadors suffer from include:Hip dysplasiaBack injuriesGlaucomaBloat","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Bassador's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Bassadors are prone to weight gain, and their energy levels can vary from dog to dog; some have the higher energy of a Labrador Retriever, while others prefer to take it slower like a Basset Hound. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Longer-eared Bassadors will need extra care taken for their ears to prevent infection. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be loudly clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this. Also be sure to brush your Bassador's teeth daily.Your main concern when it comes to your Bassador's health will be regulating their weight. Basset Hounds love to munch, and both the Labrador Retriever and the Basset Hound are prone to weight gain if they do not receive the adequate amount of exercise.","An ideal Bassador diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Bassador's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Bassador's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make aspecific recommendation.","Bassador coats are often a mix of their Labrador Retriever and Basset Hound parents' coats and colors. Commonly, if mixed with a Yellow Labrador Retriever, the Bassador has a predominantly white coat with patches of black, brown, or yellow. If bred with a Black Labrador Retriever, your Bassador could be a mix of brown, black, white, and yellow.Bassadors' coats are thick, short, and dense. You can expect a lot of shedding from your Bassador. Bassadors are also prone to getting stinky quickly, so regular bathing is required. If your Bassador has a wrinkly face, you will also have to make sure to completely dry and clean the wrinkles.Since Bassadors have short, thick coats, and they are fairly capable of tolerating hot and cold weather. They can become somewhat easily overheated due to their coat, though, so be sure to keep your Bassador cool on extremely hot days.","Bassadors can make amazing family pets if they inherit the outgoing nature of the Labrador Retriever. Still, it is important to make sure any children are taught how to interact with your Bassador to make sure everyone--your Bassador included--stays safe.Since they do have a higher prey drive, Bassadors may be prone to chasing other pets, such as cats. A slow introduction and monitored socialization should help your Bassador get along with the other animals in your home. As the Bassador demands a lot of attention, they also may prefer to be the sole pet of the household.Still, many Bassadors get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Bassadors because they are a mixed breed.

Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long—usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Basset Fauve de Bretagne's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Basset Fauve de Bretagne diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. If they do not receive their daily exercise, like all dog breeds, they will gain weight if overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their number of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Basset Fauve de Bretagne's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs—including weight, energy, and health—to make a specific recommendation.","Basset Fauve de Bretagne coats are almost a ""wash-and-wear"" type that is coarse and wiry. The main colors of the Basset Fauve de Bretagne are fawn, wheaten, and red wheaten.Their coats are wiry, dense, and harsh to the touch. These pups are not a good choice for those with allergies. The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a good choice if you don't have the time, skill, or money to take care of a high maintenance dog.Because they tend to have dense coats, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne do well in some colder climates. Make sure to cut their hair if you live in a hotter environment.","The Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a small to medium sized dog breed, so they can easily be injured by overly excited children. Though they can get along with children of all ages, make sure kids know how to handle smaller dog breeds gently. For younger children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. That said, the Basset Fauve de Bretagne aren't naturally fond of each other animals and may prefer to be the solo pet in the household.Still, many Basset Fauve de Bretagne get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.","Because the Basset Fauve de Bretagne is a somewhat rare breed, it may be difficult to find a breed-specific rescue. However, you can always check with your local shelter, and you may want to try a rescue that caters to all types of dogs.

Crate training is recommended.If they catch an interesting scent, Basset Hounds may try to follow it, no matter how much danger it poses to them. Keep your Basset on leash when outside and not in a fenced yard. Also, take him to obedience class and be sure he responds well to the Come command. Use gentleness and patience to train him. Hounds of all types typically think for themselves and don't respond well to harsh training techniques.One of the primary reasons that Basset Hounds are given up to rescue or for adoption is that they ""drool too much."" Because of the loose skin around their mouths, they also tend to make quite a mess when they drink. If you're a fastidious housekeeper who can't stand drool, a Basset Hound is not the best choice for you.Basset Hounds often have flatulence. If this problem seems excessive, talk to your vet. A change in diet may help.Obesity is a real problem for Basset Hounds. They love to eat and will overeat if given the chance. If they put on too much weight, they can begin to have joint and back problems. Portion out food relative to your Basset's condition, not by the recommendation on the bag or can.Because Basset Hounds are prone to bloat (a potentially fatal condition), it's better to feed them two or three smaller meals a day rather than one large meal a day. Don't allow your Basset to exercise too strenuously after eating, and watch him for about an hour after eating to make sure he's okay.Your Basset's long ears need to be checked and cleaned each week to help prevent ear infections. You may find that you need to wash the ear flaps even more often, because they can drag in puddles and pick up dirt as they drag the ground.Basset Hounds can howl loudly, especially if they are left along for long periods of time.Even though your Basset Hound is strong and amazingly agile for having such short legs, it's best to discourage him from jumping, for example, out of a car. Pick him up and support his back to ensure he doesn't get hurt.Basset puppies can suffer from joint problems as they grow. Try not to allow your puppy to overdo things when he plays and discourage him from jumping on and off furniture.With two-thirds of their body weight in the front of their bodies, Basset Hounds are not great swimmers. Don't allow your Basset Hound to fall into a swimming pool because he can quickly get into trouble.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Basset Hounds stand no more than 14 inches at the shoulder and weigh 50 to 65 pounds. They truly are big dogs with short legs. It's not easy to lift an adult Basset Hound, so take that into account before you acquire one for a home with lots of stairs. Will you be able to get the dog in and out easily if he's sick or old and needs to be carried?","The mild-mannered Basset is too laid-back to ever be sharp-tempered. He gets along with everyone, kids and other animals included, and the only thing that gets him really excited is a good scent trail. He's calm indoors but alert enough that he makes an excellent watchdog. Like all hounds, he can be stubborn when it comes to training and responds best to positive methods such as food rewards and food rewards. Bassets are pack dogs and will be unhappy if left alone all day. The company of another dog is helpful.Like every dog, Basset Hounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Basset puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Basset Hounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Basset Hounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Basset Hounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV): Also called bloat or gastric torsion. This is a life-threatening condition that can affect deep-chested dogs like Basset Hounds, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and the type of food might also be factors in bloat. It is more common among older dogs, but can occur at any age. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it's recommended that dogs who develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.Von Willebrand's Disease: This is a hereditary disorder that can cause mild to moderately severe bleeding and a prolonged bleeding time. If you suspect that your Basset has von Willebrand's disease, ask your vet to do a blood test and take necessary precautions before any surgical procedure.Panosteitis (also called Wandering or Transient Lameness): This is an elusive ailment that is sometimes seen in young Basset Hounds. Its primary sign is sudden lameness and puppies usually outgrow it by the age of two years with no long-term problems. The lameness can be slight or severe. Many vets are not aware of this problem in Basset Hounds and may misdiagnose it as elbow dysplasia, hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, or even more serious disorders. If misdiagnosed, the vet may want to do surgery on your dog that isn't needed. If signs occur, ask for a second opinion from an orthopedic specialist before allowing surgery to be performed.Glaucoma: Basset Hounds are prone to glaucoma, a condition in which pressure builds up inside the eye. It can lead to blindness if not detected and treated early. If you notice your Basset Hound squinting, tearing, or rubbing at his eyes, or if the eye or eyes appear to be red or bulging, take him to the vet immediately for a checkup. Glaucoma can cause damage to the retina and optic nerve in a matter of hours, so a trip to the emergency room can definitely be warranted.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Thrombopathia: This is another blood platelet disorder that is sometimes found in Basset Hounds. Like von Willebrand's, thrombopathia affects the ability of the blood to clot.Eyelid and Eyelash Problems: Bassets are prone to ectropion (a turning out of the eyelids), resulting in a dry cornea, and entropion (a turning in of the eyelids), causing lashes to dig into the surface of the eye. Your vet should be able to determine if your Basset has either of these problems and can correct the problem surgically if needed.Intervertebral Disc Disease: Basset Hounds are especially prone to having back problems. This may be due to genetics, moving the wrong way, or falling or jumping on or off furniture. Signs of a back problem include an inability to raise up on the rear legs, paralysis, and sometimes loss of bowel and bladder control. It's important to always support your Basset Hound's back and rear when holding him. If a problem occurs, treatment may consist of anything from crate confinement with anti-inflammatory medications to surgery to remove the discs that are causing the problem or even confining the dog to a doggie wheelchair. Some owners have found that they can help ward off problems by taking their Basset Hounds to chiropractors that have experience in working with dogs.Ear Infections: Because the Basset's long ears don't allow sufficient circulation of air to the inside of the ear, infections can develop. Ward them off by cleaning your Basset's ears every week and taking him to the vet if his ears smell bad or seem inflamed.Obesity: Obesity is a serious problem for long-backed breeds like Bassets. Although your Basset Hound is likely to be a ""chow hound"" and look at you pleadingly for more, find out how much you should feed him to maintain a healthy weight and stick to it for his own good.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia occurs commonly in Basset Hounds. Many factors, including genetics, environment, and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Bassets may be able to lead normal, healthy lives, but some might require surgery to get around easily. This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Cherry Eye: This is a condition in which the gland beneath the third eyelid protrudes and looks rather like a cherry in the corner of the eye. Your vet may need to remove the gland.","Basset Hounds are usually calm dogs that do well even in small houses and apartments. They should live indoors with their family, ideally with access to a yard. They're not suited to living outdoors in extreme heat or cold.Bassets are inactive indoors, happy to lie in the sun all day, but they'll enjoy a long and meandering walk with lots of sniffing time. Don't be tempted to let your Basset become a couch potato. Bassets are prone to obesity, and too much weight can stress their joints.When Bassets are outdoors, they should be in a fenced yard or on leash so they don't wander off after an interesting scent. Until he's a year old, discourage your Basset puppy from jumping on and off furniture and going up and down stairs, which puts extra stress on his front legs and back and can injure his joints. You may need to help a Basset of any age in and out of the car. He's not a very good jumper. Consider getting him a ramp or steps.Bassets can be independent, with a mind of their own. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Basset who's treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Bassets will develop selective hearing if there's something more exciting to pay attention to.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dog food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Bassets like to eat and are prone to obesity. Keep your Basset Hound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time.If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Basset Hound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Basset Hounds have smooth, short hair that repels dirt and water. The coat is dense enough to protect them in all sorts of weather. The skin is loose and elastic, giving the Basset his classic droopy hound dog appearance.The Basset Hound breed standard — a written description of how a breed looks and acts — allows all hound colors, but the most common colors are tri-color (tan, black, and white), black and white, brown and white, or red and white. Lemon and white is acceptable, but rarely seen.Because the standard says that any recognizable hound color is acceptable, blue Basset Hounds (actually gray) may be seen, but that coloration is undesirable because it's the result of a recessive gene that has been associated with numerous genetic problems, such as periscoping intestines, skin allergies, and food allergies.Except for cleaning their ears and facial wrinkles and wiping up the drool they leave behind, Basset Hounds are easy to groom. Their short coats repel dirt and water. They rarely need baths (unless they have rolled in something particularly stinky), and a good rubdown with a bristle brush, a coarse cloth, or a hound glove is all that's needed to keep their coats in good condition. Basset Hounds shed all year around, but if you brush them weekly, this shouldn't be a problem.Basset Hound ears are long and drag the ground, so they can get very dirty. Ear infections are also an issue because air doesn't circulate well in the inner ear. Clean the interior of your Basset Hound's ears at least once a week with a solution recommended by your vet, wipe down the outside of the ears to remove any dirt, clean out the facial wrinkles with a damp cloth and thoroughly dry them, and check his large paws for sores between the toes.Brush your Basset's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Basset enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Basset to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Bassets are fond of children and get along well with them. If anything, you'll need to protect your Basset from being ridden or otherwise tormented by them.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Being pack dogs, Bassets enjoy the company of other dogs and can also get along fine with cats, especially if they're introduced at an early age.","Basset Hounds are often purchased without any clear understandingof what goes into owning one.

Some people say it can take up to a year to fully housetrain some Beagles. Crate training is absolutely recommended.Beagles can get bored if left alone in a house too long. If left in a backyard, Beagles will start finding ways to amuse themselves, usually by howling, digging, or trying to escape.The most common reason Beagles are turned over to rescue groups is because either their owners or their owners' neighbors got tired of their baying. Be sure that you are prepared to work with your dog to control excessive barking and howling.Beagles are targets for thieves who would steal them and perhaps sell them to research laboratories for use in experiments. Supervise your Beagle when he is outdoors and be sure to have him microchipped!Since they are scenthounds, Beagles will wander off if they catch an enticing smell in the air. Their noses control their brains, and if they smell something interesting, nothing else exists in their world.Although they are loving and gentle, Beagles can have an independent, stubborn streak. Obedience training is recommended, but be sure the instructor of the class understands hound personality and favors using food as a reward (which few Beagles can resist).Do you remember how the famous cartoon Beagle Snoopy worried about his food bowl? Beagles are ""chow hounds"" and will overeat if given a chance. Monitor the amount of food you give them and be sure to keep your cupboards closed and your trashcans secured. Otherwise, your Beagle will sniff out the foods he likes the best.In regards to food, your Beagle probably will take its food bowl pretty seriously. Teach children to respect your Beagle while it is eating, and not to approach it or tease it with food.Beagles are not good protection or guard dogs because they're usually friendly to everyone they meet.","The American Kennel Club recognizes two varieties of Beagle. The 13-inch variety is for hounds that don't exceed 13 inches in height at the shoulder, and the 15-inch variety is for hounds that stand 13 inches to 15 inches at the shoulder. Depending on their height, Beagles weigh between 18 and 30 pounds.","Beagles are gentle, sweet, and funny. They will make you laugh, but that's when they're not making you cry because of their often naughty behavior. Beagle people spend a lot of time trying to outthink their dogs, and they often must resort to food rewards to lure the Beagle into a state of temporary obedience.Like every dog, the Beagle needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Beagle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Not all Beagles will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Intervertebral Disk Disease: The spinal cord is surrounded by the vertebral column, and between the bones of the vertebral column are intervertebral discs that work as shock absorbers and allow normal movement of the vertebrae. The discs are made of two layers, an outer fibrous layer and an inner jelly-like layer. Intervertebral disc disease occurs when the jelly like inner layer protrudes into the spinal canal and pushes against the spinal cord. Compression of the spinal cord may be minimal, causing neck or back pain, or it can be severe, causing loss of sensation, paralysis, and lack of bowel or bladder control. The damage done by the spinal compression may be irreversible. Treatment is based on several factors, including location, severity, and length of time between injury and treatment. Confining the dog may be of some use, but surgery is often needed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. Surgery is not always successful.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Cherry Eye: This is a condition in which the gland under the third eyelid protrudes and looks rather like a cherry in the corner of the eye. Your vet may need to remove the gland.Glaucoma: This is a painful disease in which pressure in the eye becomes abnormally high. Eyes are constantly producing and draining a fluid called aqueous humor — if the fluid doesn't drain correctly, the pressure inside the eye increases causing damage to the optic nerve and resulting in vision loss and blindness. There are two types. Primary glaucoma, which is hereditary, and secondary glaucoma which is a result of inflammation, a tumor, or injury. Glaucoma generally affects one eye first, which will be red, teary, squinty, and appear painful. A dilated pupil won't react to light, and the front of the eye will have a whitish, almost blue cloudiness. Vision loss and eventually blindness will result, sometimes even with treatment (surgery or medication, depending on the case).Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog's eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia.Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. Epilepsy can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Beagle Dwarfism: This is a condition where the dog is smaller than normal. This condition may or may not be accompanied by other physical abnormalities, such as extremely short legs.Chinese Beagle Syndrome (CBS): This is a condition that is characterized by a wide skull and slanted eyes. The dog grows normally otherwise. Quite often, dogs with CBS have heart problems and toe abnormalities.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Beagles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","A fenced backyard is a necessity with a scenthound such as a Beagle. When outside, your Beagle should be on lead in unconfined areas, or securely confined and supervised. He's a wanderer by nature, so in case he escapes — a common occurrence with Beagles — be sure he's microchipped and wearing identification tags on his collar so he can be returned to you.Some people prefer to use an underground electronic fence, but this type of enclosure doesn't prevent other animals from coming into your yard. Besides, if a scent is enticing enough your Beagle will be more than willing to risk a momentary shock to follow it.Like all dogs, Beagles benefit from obedience training. Positive reinforcement techniques work best because Beagles will simply switch off when treated harshly. Most Beagles are more than happy to do anything for a tasty treat.Adolescent Beagles are full of energy and need a lot of opportunities to work it all off. They love to go for walks with their family, or, even better, a good run across a field to hunt down rabbits (not recommended unless you have trained your dog to come back to you). They'll enjoy jogging with you, but wait until they're 18 months or older before starting them on a repetitive exercise like this.When mature, a Beagle can become fairly lazy, content to lie about the house all day, getting up for meals and perhaps an occasional scratching of the ears. Since this is a breed prone to obesity, don't let this happen.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Beagles are food thieves. These dogs will raid your pantry and garbage daily if given the chance, and they're willing to eat until they pop. Keep yours in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.Also, dole out treats sparingly. Your Beagle will be just as happy to get a bite-size training treat as a bigger biscuit.For more on feeding your Beagle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The breed standard for Beagles says ""any hound color"" is acceptable. The most common color for Beagles is tricolor with a black saddle (the area across the back), white legs, chest, belly, and a white tip on the tail, and tan on the head and around the saddle.The second most common color combination is red and white in an Irish spotting pattern on the face, neck, legs and tip of the tail. Whatever their color, they typically have a white tip on their tails so hunters can see them when they're hunting in tall grass.Beagles have a smooth, dense double coat that is resistant to rain. They should be brushed with a medium-bristle brush or a hound glove (a rubber mitt with nubs on the palm area) at least once a week to loosen and remove dead hair and encourage new hair growth.Beagles shed, but because their hair is short, it isn't too noticeable. Their coats tend to get thicker in the winter, so they shed more in the spring. They are clean dogs (unless, of course, they've found something appealingly stinky to roll in) and generally don't require frequent baths.Since Beagles are drop-eared dogs, air doesn't circulate well inside their ears and they can get infections. Check their ears at least every two weeks for signs of infection or waxy buildup. Check them also if you notice your Beagle shaking his head a lot or scratching at his ears. Never allow water or oils to enter his ears.Brush your Beagle's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Beagle to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Beagles bond with everyone in the family, especially children. They can be rambunctious when playing, however, so they need to be properly socialized and supervised with very young children. In addition, Beagles tend to be ""mouthy,"" grabbing things, including your or your child's hand, with their mouths to play. They do this in fun and can be trained not to do this.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Because of their pack dog heritage, Beagles enjoy company and don't like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat will help meet their companionship needs.",Beagles are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Discuss this with your veterinarian to decide whether a daily preventive is a better choice.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",A Bearded Collie male stands 21 to 22 inches at the shoulder; females 20 to 21 inches at the shoulder. Weight ranges from 45 to 55 pounds.,"A Beardie is smart, resourceful, and confident. His bouncy, bubbly personality makes him fun to be with, but when it comes to training he can be an independent thinker who likes to have his own way. He's a boisterous playmate for children and has a sense of humor that makes him a joy to be around.When choosing a Beardie puppy, remember that temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Temperament varies in individual dogs. Some Beardies are sweet and quiet, while others are loud and enthusiastic. Tell the breeder what you're looking for in a dog, and she can help you choose the puppy that will fit your personality and lifestyle.Always meet at least one of the parents (usually the mother is the one who's available) to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.","Bearded Collies are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Beardies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're buying or living with a Beardie.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Persistent Pupillary Membrane (PPM): Persistent Pupillary Membranes are strands of tissue in the eye, remnants of the fetal membrane that nourished the lenses of the eyes before birth. They normally disappear by the time a puppy is 4 or 5 weeks old, but sometimes they persist. The strands can stretch from iris to iris, iris to lens, or cornea to iris, and sometimes they are found in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye. For many dogs, the strands do not cause any problems and generally they break down by 8 weeks of age. If the strands do not break down, they can lead to cataracts or cause corneal opacities. Eye drops prescribed by your veterinarian can help break them down.","The Beardie is an indoor/outdoor dog. He needs to live inside with his people with access to a yard or fenced acreage where he can run. He's not suited to apartment life. Beardies enjoy being with their people, whether they're indoors or outdoors. They'll be satisfied with a couple of half-hour walks or play sessions with a ball daily.Obedience training is a must if you are going to establish order and discipline in your dog's life. Make learning fun, and teach them with positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise. Bearded Collies do not learn under abusive or harsh conditions. Begin training early and you will obtain excellent results. To ensure that he doesn't accidentally knock over a toddler or older person, teach him to sit for attention.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dog food a day, divided into two meals.

The coat falls naturally to either side without need of a part. Long hair on the cheeks, lower lips, and under the chin forms the beard for which he is known.All Bearded Collies are born black, blue, brown, or fawn, with or without white markings. Some carry a fading gene, and as they mature, the coat lightens, darkening again slightly after one year of age. A puppy born black may become any shade of gray from black to slate to silver. The dogs that are born brown will lighten from chocolate to sandy, and the blues and fawns show shades from dark to light. Dogs without the fading gene stay the color they were when they were born. The white only occurs as a blaze on the face, on the head, on the tip of the tail, on the chest, legs, feet, and around the neck. Tan markings occasionally appear on the eyebrows, inside the ears, on the cheeks, under the root of the tail and on the legs where the white joins the main color.The Beardie's long double coat requires weekly brushing with a bristle or pin brush to remove tangles and mats and reduce shedding. Mist the coat with a conditioning spray before brushing to reduce static and keep the hairs from breaking. If you run across any mats or tangles, spray them with some anti-tangle spray and work them out with your fingers until you can run a comb through the hair smoothly. Completely brushing the coat takes half an hour to an hour each week. Bathing can be done as needed.As your Beardie puppy matures from 9 to 18 months of age, his soft puppy coat will start to come out. Brush him two or three times a week to help remove it and prevent mats. Once his adult coat has come in, brushing him weekly will be plenty.Beardies shed heavily once a year for two to four weeks, and you'll probably want to brush more frequently during this time to keep the level of loose hair under control.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Beardie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Nails should be trimmed regularly to keep them short. Your Beardie's nails may need to be trimmed weekly or only monthly; each dog is different. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog's feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your bouncy Beardie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Beardie to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Full of bounce, humor, and energy, Beardies are excellent playmates for kids. Of course, it's important to teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Beardies get along well with other dogs and cats if they're introduced to them early, although they can be possessive of their toys. ""Mine, all mine"" is their motto. They always enjoy a game of chase, so they do best with cats that stand their ground rather than turn tail and run.","Beardies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

Weight ranges from 17 to 23 pounds and should be proportionate to height.","Alert, energetic, and intelligent, the Bedlington is an excellent companion and watchdog. He enjoys being the center of attention and likes to entertain his people. He can be aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex and will chase small furry animals.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Bedlingtons need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bedlington puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Bedlington Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Bedlingtons will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Bedlingtons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Copper Toxicosis: This hereditary disease is caused by failure of the liver to expel dietary copper, leading to a buildup in the body resulting in illness and death. It is an autosomal recessive trait; affected dogs must inherit a gene from both parents to be symptomatic. If they inherit a gene from only one parent, they will be a carrier. The recent development of a DNA test makes it possible to screen for affected dogs and carriers and remove them from the gene pool.Patellar Luxation: This is a dislocation of the kneecap (patella) and is sometimes referred to as slipped stifles. It can be from injury or congenital (present at birth). Patellar Luxation can be mild with little or no symptoms or severe with intense pain and limping. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog's eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then removing them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia.Renal Cortical Hypoplasia: This condition occurs when the cortex of one or both of the kidneys develops abnormally. The dog will develop kidney failure. First signs of kidney failure are increased thirst that causes an increase in urination. There is no cure; the treatment consists of managing the signs and trying to prevent additional damage to the kidneys.Retinal Dysplasia: This is a developmental malformation of the retina that the dog is born with. Most cases are mild and there is no detectable loss in vision. Veterinary ophthalmologists can do tests to determine if puppies are affected when they are 7 to 12 weeks old. Retinal dysplasia shouldn't affect a dog's ability to function as a companion, but affected dogs shouldn't be bred.","Bedlington Terriers are a hardy breed with moderate activity levels. They are capable of running at high speeds, so a safely fenced area is important. They are not suited to living outdoors. They are small enough to be appropriate for an apartment as long as they have a safe place to exercise.Exercise for the Bedlington can mean a nice walk or a vigorous game of fetch. He can jog with you or go on a hike. You can also train him for agility, obedience, or tracking. He's quiet in the home, happy to relax on the sofa with you.The Bedlington is intelligent, and that intelligence makes him only moderately easy to train. He does best when you can persuade him that doing what you want is really his idea or benefits him in some way. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Harsh words and physical force will not work with this breed, as they will only bring out his stubborn streak and begin a battle of wills that you will probably lose.Like all dogs, Bedlington puppies can be destructive. Crate them to prevent them from getting into trouble if you're not around to supervise.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

It feels crisp but not wiry and has a tendency to curl, especially on the head and face. It doesn't shed much. The coat of a Bedlington trimmed for the show ring is no longer than one inch on the body, with the hair on the legs slightly longer.We tend to think of him as white, but the Bedlington comes in several colors and combinations: blue, sandy, liver, blue and tan, sandy and tan, and liver and tan. In bi-colors, the tan markings are found on the legs, chest, under the tail, inside the hindquarters and over each eye. Bedlington puppies are dark when they're born and lighten as they mature. The topknot (a tuft of longer hair on top of the head) of all adults should be lighter than the body color.Unlike many terrier breeds, the Bedlington's coat doesn't need to be stripped. You'll need to comb him at least once a week. You can take him to a professional groomer for his lamb clip, or your Bedlington's breeder can show you how to clip him yourself. The face must be hand-scissored to achieve the unique appearance.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Bedlington's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long.

He's probably best suited to homes with older children. While a Bedlington will tolerate a certain amount of rough handling, he will set limits when things get too rough, and he doesn't understand that a child's skin isn't as tough as another dog's.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Bedlingtons can get along with other dogs, especially if they're raised with them, but they may be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex. And like most terriers, they might not start a fight, but they won't back down from one. Bedlingtons can be fierce fighters if aroused, so be cautious when introducing them to new canine companions, especially other adults of the same sex. Male Bedlingtons especially will persist in a fight until major damage is done. A Bedlington might learn to get along with your indoor cat if he's raised with him, but outdoor cats and other animals will be fair game for him to chase.",Bedlington Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Training should be fun, consistent, and positive.Because of their intelligence, high energy, and other characteristics, Malinois are not recommended for inexperienced dog owners.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males are 24 to 26 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 60 to 80 pounds. Females are 22 to 24 inches tall and weigh 40 to 60 pounds.,"This is an outstanding working dog who is confident and protective in any situation. He's affectionate with family members but reserved toward strangers until he takes their measure. The watchdog abilities of the Malinois are excellent. He protects his people and property with only as much force as is required. Shyness and aggression are never appropriate in this breed.That said, temperament doesn't just happen. It's affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Malinois need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Malinois puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Belgian Malinois are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Malinois will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Malinois, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA). This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Elbow Dysplasia. This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain.Anesthesia Sensitivity. Belgian Malinois are very sensitive to anesthesia. They have a higher than average rate of death when put under anesthesia because of their muscle to fat ratio. Be sure your vet understands this sensitivity before allowing your Malinois to have surgery or even have its teeth cleaned.","Belgian Malinois can do well in small quarters if they receive enough exercise. They prefer cool climates but adapt well to warmer environments. They do best when they are allowed to be a part of the family and are able to live indoors at least part of the time.If possible, provide your Malinois with some off-leash exercise in a fenced area in addition to long walks or jogging. Malinois need about 20 minutes of activity three or four times a day, and a leisurely walk won't satisfy them. They're built for action. If you like to hike or jog, your Belgian Malinois will be happy to be by your side. Consider training him to compete in obedience or agility. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you keep him active. Don't be surprised if he runs in large circles in your yard; it's a remnant of his herding heritage.Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes, daily half-mile walks, and playtime in the yard will meet their needs. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he's a year old, your Malinois pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as asphalt and concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.Malinois are sensitive and highly trainable. Be firm, calm, and consistent with them. Anger and physical force are counterproductive.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Malinois, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Malinois have short, straight hair that feels hard to the touch. The hard topcoat and dense undercoat provide weather resistance for a dog that was bred to work outdoors in all conditions. The hair is slightly longer around the neck, forming a sort of mini-mane.The coat is typically fawn- to mahogany-colored with a black mask on the face, black ears, and black tips on the hairs. Fawn-colored Malinois sometimes have a tiny bit of white on the tips of their toes or a small white spot on the chest.The short, smooth coat of the Malinois is easy to groom. Brush it weekly with a firm bristle brush, and bathe only when necessary. Malinois shed year-round, more heavily in the spring and fall.Brush your Malinois' teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog's feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Malinois enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Malinois to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Well-socialized Malinois are good with children, especially if they are raised with them, but because of their herding heritage they may have a tendency to nip at their heels and try to herd them when playing. You must teach your Malinois that this behavior is unacceptable. An adult Malinois who's unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Malinois can be aggressive toward other dogs and cats unless they're brought up with them from puppyhood. If you want your Malinois to get along with other animals you must start early and reward them for appropriate behavior. If your Malinois hasn't been socialized to other animals, it's your responsibility to keep him under control in their presence.","Belgian Malinois are often purchased without any clear understandingof what goes into owning one.

He's described as always in motion when not under command. His observation skills make him an excellent watchdog, but his herding heritage makes him naturally distrustful of strangers. If he isn't properly trained and socialized this distrust can lead to aggressive behavior. A well-socialized and trained Belgian Sheepdog is a confident protector of his people and property and doesn't attack without cause. He's affectionate and friendly with people he knows, especially family members. He's also demanding of their time and attention. This breed does not like to be left alone; he wants to be doing things with the family. He requires plenty of mental stimulation in the form of training and play, especially with puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes, as well as interactive play such as fetch games.This ideal Belgian Sheepdog temperament doesn't just happen.

Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Belgian Sheepdog has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye.

There are many different types of cancer and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, the tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy and some are treated both surgically and medically.Anesthesia Sensitivity: Some Belgian Sheepdogs appear to be sensitive to anesthesia. It is important to alert your veterinarian to this possibility so he or she can follow the same anesthetic protocols that are used with sighthounds, including a pre-anesthesia physical exam and lab work, obtaining a current weight, careful administration of anesthesia, and monitoring the dog's vital signs during and after surgery.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.","The Belgian Sheepdog is an indoor/outdoor dog. He should live indoors with the family but needs access to a securely fenced yard that will prevent him from escaping to chase passing cyclists, joggers, and cars.If possible, provide your Belgian Sheepdog with some off-leash exercise in a fenced area in addition to long walks or jogging. He needs at least an hour of activity daily, which can be broken up into two or three exercise or play sessions. He enjoys playing Frisbee and other retrieving games. If you like to hike or jog, your Belgian Sheepdog will be happy to be by your side. Consider training him to compete in obedience, tracking, or agility. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you keep him busy.

These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.While the Belgian Sheepdog is smart and highly trainable, he is an independent thinker. To succeed in training him, you'll need to earn his trust and respect without the use of anger, intimidation, or physical force. For all his confidence and strength, the Belgian Sheepdog is sensitive, and his temperament can be damaged, sometimes irreparably, by harsh corrections. He does best with a combination of firm, fair, consistent rules and rewards for correct behavior.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The topcoat is abundant with long, straight hair that's moderately harsh to the touch, never wiry or silky. The soft, dense undercoat provides protection from the weather and varies in thickness depending on the climate in which the Belgian Sheepdog lives.The hair is short on the head, outside the ears, and on the front part of the legs. Tufts of hair protect the opening of the ear. The hair on the rest of the body is long and includes long and abundant hair — called a collarette — around the neck, which is most noticeable in males; a fringe of long hair running down the back of the front legs and back of the thighs, and long, heavy, abundant hair on the tail. As in most species, the male is more ornamental than the female.The ideal Belgian Sheepdog is completely black or black with a bit of white between the pads of the feet, on the tips of the hind toes, or a small patch or strip on the forechest. You may also see a bit of frost on the chin or muzzle. White on the tips of the front toes is considered a fault according to the breed standard, but of course it doesn't affect the Belgian Sheepdog's abilities as a companion or working dog.Expect to spend 15 to 20 minutes per week brushing out that coat to remove dead hair and prevent mats or tangles. If you do this, you shouldn't have a lot of loose hair flying around your house, especially if you supplement the weekly brushing with a quick daily brushing of a minute or two. Grooming tools that will come in handy include a medium-size pin brush for long hair, a wire slicker brush for use on puppies and on areas of the body with shorter hair, a grooming rake for removing shedding hair, and a mat comb for removing the occasional mat that forms behind the ears or in the areas where the legs join the body.Like most double-coated dogs, Belgian Sheepdogs shed year-round with at least one heavy shed per year depending on the climate in which they live and how much coat they have. To get the shedding period over with more quickly, give a warm bath or two to help release the coat and brush more frequently. Some people save the fur and have it spun into yarn and made into sweaters or other items of clothing.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care.

If your Belgian Tervuren has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.","The Belgian Tervuren is an indoor/outdoor dog. He should live indoors with the family but needs access to a securely fenced yard that will prevent him from escaping to chase passing cyclists, joggers, and cars.If possible, provide your Belgian Tervuren with some off-leash exercise in a fenced area in addition to long walks or jogging. He needs at least an hour of activity daily, which can be broken up into two or three exercise or play sessions. If you like to hike or jog, your Tervuren will be happy to be by your side. Consider training him to compete in obedience, tracking, or agility. It doesn't really matter what you do as long as you keep him active. Don't be surprised if he runs in large circles in your yard; it's a remnant of his herding heritage.Introduce puppies to exercise gradually. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization; add 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he's a year old, your Terv pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as asphalt and concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.Belgian Tervuren are sensitive and highly trainable. Be firm, calm, and consistent with them. Anger and physical force are counterproductive. Use positive training techniques, rewarding them with praise, play, or treats when they perform commands correctly or do anything you like — even if you didn't ask them to.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Belgian Turvuren, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Belgian Tervuren is a double-coated breed. The topcoat is abundant with long, straight hair that's moderately harsh to the touch, never wiry or silky. The soft, dense undercoat provides protection from the weather and varies in thickness depending on the climate in which the Terv lives. The hair is short on the head, outside the ears, and on the front part of the legs. Tufts of hair protect the opening of the ear. The hair on the rest of the body is long and includes sort of a mini-mane — called a collarette — around the neck, which is most noticeable in males; and a fringe of long hair down the back of the front legs and back of the thighs and on the tail. As in most species, the male is more ornamental than the female.The strong, rich color of the Belgian Tervuren coat ranges from fawn to russet mahogany with a black overlay. The lighter guard hairs are tipped with black. The chest is black or black and gray, the face has a black mask, the ears are black, and the tail usually has a dark or black tip. It's normal for Belgian Tervuren, especially males, to become darker with age, usually on the shoulders, back, and rib area. In either sex, a good coat never looks washed out or appears predominantly cream or gray in color, although you'll find cream, light beige, or gray on the underside of the tail, body, and back of the thighs. The tips of the toes may be white.Like most double-coated dogs, Tervs shed year-round. Males usually have one heavy shed per year, while females shed between each heat cycle. Expect to spend 15 to 20 minutes per week brushing out that coat to remove dead hair and prevent mats or tangles. If you do this, you shouldn't have a lot of loose hair flying around your house, especially if you supplement the weekly brushing with a quick daily brushing of a minute or two.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Terv's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog's feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Terv enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Terv to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Well-socialized Tervs are good with children, especially if they are raised with them, but because of their herding heritage they may have a tendency to nip at their heels and try to herd them when playing. You must teach your Terv that this behavior is unacceptable. An adult Tervuren who's unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Tervs get along best with other dogs and cats when they're brought up with them from puppyhood. Sometimes they become best friends with cats and other animals and will protect them as they would members of their flock, and sometimes they all come to an agreement of mutual indifference. Tervs do have a chase instinct, however, and even if they don't chase ""their"" cats, they may be unable to resist chasing cats or other animals that intrude in their yards. If you want your Terv to get along with other animals you must start early and reward them for appropriate behavior. If your Terv hasn't been socialized to other animals, it's your responsibility to keep him under control in their presence.","Belgian Tervuren are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Tervs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Terv rescue.Belgian Tervuren Rescue Inc.","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Belgian Tervuren.American Belgian Tervuren Club, Inc."

Tiny Bernedoodles tend to live longer than standard.,"Because they are a mixed breed, Bernedoodles tend to have fewer health problems than either Poodles or Bernese Mountain Dogs.Breeding of Bernedoodles began in 2003 with the sole purpose of creating a great companion dog, not a dog that would perform well in shows or just look cute.They may be stubborn as puppies, but that usually fades with age, and their intelligence makes them very trainable for patient owners.Bernedoodles are usually hypoallergenic and shed very little.Though they are generally good with children and other dogs, early socialization is always helpful in making sure they stay calm and comfortable in new situations.Bernedoodles can vary greatly in appearance depending on which traits they receive from each parent.They are equally happy playing outside as they are cuddling up with their favorite humans.Bernedoodles crave attention and are best suited to a home where they are not left alone for long periods of time.","There are three sizes of Bernedoodle: tiny, miniature, and standard. These result from the size of the Poodle parent, which can be toy, mini, or standard size. The Tiny Bernedoodle stands at 12 to 17 inches tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 10 to 24 pounds. The Miniature Bernedoodle stands at 18 to 22 inches tall and weighs 25 to 49 pounds. The Standard Bernedoodle stands at 23 to 29 inches and weigh 70 to 90 pounds. Males are generally larger than females.","Bernedoodles seem to get many of the best personality traits from the Bernese Mountain Dog and Poodle breeds. Exactly which traits they inherit from their parents can differ a bit, though, and individual personalities of dogs within the breed vary. Bernedoodles tend to be highly intelligent, hardworking when necessary, loyal, and just a bit goofy. They are good with children and other dogs, provided they have been well socialized.Some Bernedoodles inherit the Bernese Mountain Dog's stubbornness, which may make them difficult to train, however this trait tends to fade away as puppies become adolescent dogs. Once they begin training, their intelligence helps them pick up commands more easily than other dogs. Bernedoodles may also inherit the Bernese's apprehension around strangers, so socialization is important, especially at a young age.Bernedoodles can have high energy levels and crave attention and at least moderate exercise. They do best in homes where they are not left alone for long periods of time. Tiny and Miniature Bernedoodles do better with apartment and city life than Standard Bernedoodles. They'll need at least a nice, long daily walk to burn off energy. Generally, they want nothing more than to be with their humans and are just as ready to go outside and play with them as they are to join them on the couch for cuddles.","Bernedoodles tend to be healthier dogs than either of their parents. Inbreeding has left many purebred dogs open to genetically inherited diseases and conditions, but cross-breeding reduces that risk. Because the breed hasn't been around for very long, information about health concerns for Bernedoodles is somewhat limited. The instances of cancer in the Bernedoodle seem to be lower than those of the Bernese Mountain Dog.There are, however, some conditions that Bernedoodles may be predisposed to, including hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, eye problems, and skin issues such as allergies and hot spots. All breeds may be affected by any number of health concerns, but the Bernedoodle is generally a healthy breed.","Tiny and Miniature Bernedoodles are more suited to apartment life, while Standard Bernedoodles do better with a nice yard to run around. Generally, this breed doesn't require much personal space, and as long as their moderate needs for physical and mental stimulation are met, they shouldn't be too destructive. They love being around their humans, so the less time they spend alone, the better.Like Poodles, Bernedoodles are quite intelligent, which means they can learn bad habits just as easily as good ones. It is important to keep up with training. Early socialization and exposure to other dogs and humans is always a good idea and will help keep them well-behaved when meeting new people or pets.","The appropriate amount to feed a Bernedoodle depends on their size, age, and activity level, which means it is highly individualized. Standard Bernedoodles may be voracious eaters that will gulp down whatever you put in front of them, so you'll have to take care to monitor their food intake and weight while providing them with plenty of physical activity. You should ask your veterinarian for dietary recommendations that suit your particular dog.","Bernedoodle coats can vary and look more Poodle-like or more closely resemble the Bernese Mountain Dog. Usually they have wavy, curly coats that don't shed much, which can help make them more suitable for people with allergies to dander. Sometimes Bernedoodles can have straighter coats, which shed more and are less hypoallergenic. The thickness of their coat helps this breed thrive in cool temperatures while providing them a fair amount of protection from the heat of summer months, as well.The color of Bernedoodle coats have quite a range. Some are pure black, others are black and white, and others are black and brown. Sometimes Bernedoodles are tri-colored with patches of black, white, and brown. They may even have other colors, as well. The most popular coat colors and markings for people seeking a Bernedoodle tend to resemble the tri-colored Bernese Mountain Dog.The curlier the Bernedoodle's coat is, the harder it is to groom. Because they shed less, they need to be brushed more often to prevent their coat from getting matted. Some Bernedoodle owners brush their dog's coat daily and treat it as a bonding experience, which this breed tends to love. Their coat must also be trimmed every few months, depending on how quickly it grows.","Bernedoodles are excellent for families with children, though it is always important to make sure children are instructed on how to properly treat animals, especially with Tiny and Miniature Bernedoodles that may be injured more easily. This breed is affectionate and loves to play, and they absolutely adore spending time with their families.Bernedoodles usually do well with other dogs, but it is important to begin socialization at an early age and keep up with it to make sure they are comfortable around new animals.","Bernedoodles are somewhat rare in shelters and rescue groups, but there are rescues that cater to Poodle mixes, and you can always keep an eye on your local shelters to see what new dogs come in.Poo-Mix Rescue may help you find a dog you're looking for, or you can try searching our database of adoptable dogs here.",not available

Currently, the life span of a Bernese Mountain Dog is comparatively short, about six to eight years, though in recent years, the life expectancy has gone up to about ten years. This may be due to more responsible breeding and regard for genetic conditions.Because of the Berner's popularity, some people have bred dogs of lesser quality in order to sell the puppies to unsuspecting buyers. Often these dogs are bought at auction and little is known about their health history. Do not support irresponsible breeding practices. It is best to get your dog from a shelter or rescue instead of giving money to those who would breed without regard for the dogs' health.Veterinary care can be costly because of the health problems in the breed.Berners shed profusely, especially in the spring and fall. If shedding drives you crazy, this may not be the right breed for you.The Berner likes to be with family. They're likely to develop annoying behavior problems, such as barking, digging, or chewing, if he's isolated from people and their activities.When Berners are mature, they are large dogs who like to have a job to do. For those reasons, it's wise—and fun—to begin obedience training early.Although they're very gentle with children, Berners sometimes accidentally knock over a small child or toddler.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.","Males, on average, stand 25 to 28 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 80 to 115 pounds. Females stand 23 to 26 inches tall and weigh 70 to 95 pounds. Individuals of the breed may be smaller or larger.","The Berner is an affectionate, intelligent, and alert dog. They're also gentle, calm, and tolerant. They like to be with family and thrive when included in family activities. Their large size is one of his most notable features, and of course early training is essential to teach them how to behave properly in the house and with people. Slow to mature, they reach adult size long before they reache mental maturity.The Berner is protective of family, though aren't usually aggressive. They can be aloof with strangers and generally a bit shy, so exposing the Berner puppy to a wide variety of people, animals, and situations is important.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them.Always meet and spend time with a dog you intend to adopt to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when they grow up, though that isn't always an option if you adopt from a shelter or rescue.Like every dog, the Berner needs early socialization—exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences—when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Berner puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly and taking your pup to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help polish their social skills.","Berners sometimes have health issues due to irresponsible breeding. Not all Berners will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.With Berners, you should talk to your vet about checking for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease. Here's more info about a few conditions to look out for.Cancer: Various forms of cancer afflict a large number of Bernese Mountain Dogs and can cause early death. Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that don't heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease common to large-breed dogs. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Portosystemic Shunt (PSS): This is a congenital abnormality in which blood vessels allow blood to bypass the liver. As a result, the blood is not cleansed by the liver as it should be. Symptoms, which usually appear before two years of age, can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Surgery is usually the best option.Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.Panosteitis: Commonly called pano, this condition causes self-limiting lameness. At about five to 12 months of age, the dog may start to limp first on one leg, then on another—then the limping will stop. There are usually no long-term effects. Rest and restricted activity may be necessary for a while if the dog is in pain. The best thing that you can do for your Berner is to feed them a high-quality dog food that doesn't have too much calcium or too high a percentage of protein, which some believe may cause pano. Ask your vet for his recommendations.Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Bernese Mountain Dogs. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. It occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to expel the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. They also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.","Berners are not suited to apartment or condo life. A home with a large, securely fenced yard is the best choice. Because the Berner is a working dog, they have plenty of energy. In addition to yard play, they need a minimum of 30 minutes of vigorous exercise every day; three times that amount keeps this sturdy dog in top condition.With their thick, handsome coat, the Berner is a natural fit for cold climates. They love to play in the snow. Conversely, with his black coat and large size, they're prone to heat stroke. Don't allow them to exercise strenuously when it's extremely hot; limit exercise to early mornings or evenings, when it's cooler. Keep them cool during the heat of the day, either inside with fans or air-conditioning or outside in the shade.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Berner puppy. Like many large-breed dogs, Berners grow rapidly between the ages of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders and injury. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.Additionally, don't let the Berner puppy run and play on hard surfaces (such as pavement), jump excessively, or pull heavy loads until they're at least two years old and their joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes, with their one-inch jumps.",A Bernese Mountain Dog diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Bernese Mountain Dog and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"The Berner coat is gorgeous: a thick double coat with a longer outer coat and a wooly undercoat. Characteristically tricolored, the majority of the Berner's body is covered with jet-black hair with rich rust and bright white. There's usually a white marking on the chest that looks like an inverted cross, a white blaze between the eyes, and white on the tip of the tail.Beauty has a price, though, and in this case it's that the Berner is a shedder. They shed moderately all year and heavily in the spring and fall. Brushing several times a week helps reduce the amount of hair around the house and keeps the coat clean and tangle-free. Periodic bathing, every three months or so, will maintain their neat appearance.Brush your Berner's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding, and your dog may not cooperate the next time they see the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.The ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Berner to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. Handle their paws frequently—dogs are touchy about their feet—and look inside their mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Berner is an excellent family pet, and they're usually gentle and affectionate with children who are kind and careful with animals. Being so large, they can inadvertently bump or knock over very young or small children.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Berner gets along with other pets well, though the greater the size difference, the more supervision and training required to keep everyone safe.","Berners are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Crate training is recommended.Bichons don't like to be left alone for long periods of time.Bichon Frise puppies are tiny and should only be handled by children under careful adult supervision.Bichons are intelligent and cunning. To help your Bichon be the best companion possible, obedience training is recommended.Grooming is a must! Be prepared to pay for professional grooming. Highly motivated owners can learn the technique, but it isn't easy and requires a lot of time.Bichons can be prone to skin problems and allergies.Because they're cute and small, you might be tempted to overprotect your Bichon Frise. This is a mistake and can lead to your dog becoming spoiled, shy, and fearful. Be watchful for dangerous situations, but teach your Bichon confidence by acting confident about his ability to cope with people, other animals, and situations.To get a healthy Bichon, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males and females stand about 9 to 11 inches tall and weigh 7 to 12 pounds.,"A cheerful attitude is the outstanding trait of the Bichon's personality. This dog loves to be loved, enjoys being the center of attention, and is adept at charming his family, neighbors, groomer, or veterinarian with his winning personality.The Bichon has a playful, independent streak, but that doesn't mean he likes to be alone. In fact, this breed hates being alone and commonly suffers from separation anxiety if left alone for many hours. In such situations, Bichons may become destructive, chewing and tearing up anything in sight. Obviously the Bichon is not a breed of choice for people who are away from home for long periods of time (indeed, no dog is).The highly intelligent Bichon needs to be taught proper canine manners, so it's essential to sign up for obedience training, beginning with puppy classes. Bichons are quick studies, so taking them to such classes can be very satisfying. They're also good at tricks and some canine sports.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Bichon needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bichon puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Bichons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Bichons will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Bichons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Bladder Problems: Bladder stones and bladder infections: are not uncommon in this breed. Many factors can cause bladder stones, including excessive protein, magnesium, and phosphorus in the diet or long periods of time between urination. Bladder infections can be traced to bacterial or viral infections. If your Bichon needs to urinate frequently, has bloody urine, or seems to have difficulty urinating and loss of appetite, take him to the vet for a checkup.Allergies: Allergies can afflict Bichons due to several different causes, including contact allergies and food allergies. Bichons are well known for being sensitive to fleabites as well. If your Bichon is scratching, licking at his paws, or rubbing his face often, suspect that he has an allergy and have him checked by your vet.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Vaccination Sensitivity: Some Bichons are affected by this sensitivity, and many suffer even from routine vaccinations. Symptoms usually include hives, facial swelling, soreness, and lethargy. In rare instances, a vaccine-sensitive dog will develop complications or even die. Watch your Bichon carefully for a few hours after he's been vaccinated, and call the vet if you notice anything unusual.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Juvenile Cataracts: Cataracts sometimes develop in relatively young (less than six years old) Bichons. This is thought to be hereditary. When buying a Bichon puppy, be sure to ask if the breeder her breeding stock is certified by the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF), and ask to see the certificates yourself.","Bichons are active dogs but do well as apartment dwellers with proper exercise and play — and they live to play. Don't leave your Bichon alone for long periods of time. To prevent destructive behavior, the wise owner leaves the Bichon in a crate when leaving the house for even a short time.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Bichon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.Bichons, like many small breeds, are prone to urolithiasis (stones in the urinary tract). Diet is an important part of treating and managing this condition; therapeutic diets and increased water intake can help prevent and control it.For more on feeding your Bichon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Bichon Frise is a double-coated breed, always white. The soft and dense undercoat and course outer coat combine to create a soft but substantial texture. The coat stands away from the body, giving it a powder-puff appearance. The most popular trim for a Bichon follows the lines of the dog's body, leaving the coat long enough to give him the signature ""poufy"" look.Bichons have a reputation for not shedding, which isn't exactly true. All creatures with hair shed. With double-coated Bichons, however, the shed hair is caught up in the undercoat instead of falling to the floor. If this dead hair isn't removed by brushing or combing, it can form mats and tangles, which can lead to skin problems if left unattended.Grooming a Bichon is not for cowards: this is a high-maintenance breed. You'll need to allot considerable time for grooming and bathing: you should brush him at least twice a week or more, and you'll need to bathe him whenever he gets dirty in order to keep that white coat clean. Be sure to make sure the coat is free of mats and tangles before bathing, or the mats will tighten and become nearly impossible to remove.You should check your Bichon's ears often to make sure they're clean. Sometimes it's necessary to pluck out the hair that grows in the ear canal (which a groomer can do if you don't feel comfortable with the job). If you notice a buildup of wax, redness, or a foul odor, or if you dog is scratching his ears and shaking his head, take him to the vet to be sure he doesn't have an ear infection.Most Bichon owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every four to six weeks for a bath, brush, haircut, nail trimming, and ear cleaning. If you want to learn how to groom your Bichon yourself, check out the many good grooming books and videos on the market for instructions.Keeping a Bichon's face clean and trimmed is important for health as well as looks. Mucus and discharge from the eyes tend to accumulate in the hair that grows around the eyes, and eye problems can result if you don't clean the area regularly.Tearstains are common, as a result of eye problems or even food allergies. Because Bichons are prone to a number of eye diseases, it's best to have your vet check your dog if tearstaining becomes a problem. Bichons are prone to blocked or small tear ducts, eyelashes that grow toward the eyeball, or eyelids that turn inward and cause the lashes to rub against the eye. Your vet will be able to determine if any of these conditions, or something else, is causing tearstains.Brush your Bichon's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Bichon to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Bichons are good family dogs and wonderful companions for children. They enjoy palling around with kids, joining in their games or sitting in their laps. They're very tolerant of the noise and commotion associated with children.As with every breed, however, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Bichon enjoys the company of other dogs, as long as he receives his fair share of attention from his owner. With proper introductions and training, the Bichon can get along with cats and other animals.","Bichons are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Bichons in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They can generally fit any household type, from singles to senior citizens and families with children of all ages.","As the Biewer Terrier is a descendant of the Yorkshire Terrier, they might be predisposed to some of the same health conditions their forebears face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems the Biewer Terrier suffers from include:GI tract sensitivityBouts of diarrheaFrequent discolored or soft stoolDental issues","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Biewer Terrier's veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine specific for your dog breed that will keep them healthy.The Biewer Terrier is a naturally active breed that requires regular daily exercise to work off their excess energy. Without enough exercise of some form, however, this breed is likely to develop behavioral problems such as digging and chewing.These pups also have long coats which will require daily brushing to prevent matting and tangled fur. You can also choose to shorten their coat which would reduce the need for brushing.Their nails should be trimmed regularly with a nail clipper or grinder to avoid overgrowth, splitting and cracking. Their ears should be checked regularly to avoid a buildup of wax and debris, which can result in an infection.Teeth should be brushed regularly. As a small breed, these dogs may be more prone to dental issues. Your vet can help you form a brushing routine and give you further instructions on dental care at home.","An ideal Biewer Terrier diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. If overfed, these pups might have a tendency to gain weight. Stick to a regular feeding schedule with few treats in between.Because they are a smaller breed, their GI system might be a little more sensitive than most dogs. Make sure to feed them high quality foods.As with all dogs, the Biewer Terrier's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Biewer Terrier's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","As the Biewer Terrier are descendants of the Yorkshire Terrier, their coats might be similar, but their colorization will different.

The face is typically black and tan with symmetrical coloring.These pups typically have long coats though you can also choose to shorten the coat to reduce the need for daily brushing. The Biewer Terrier is also considered hypoallergenic. Because of their small size and soft coat, they are quite easy to groom. If you decide to keep their coat long, daily brushing is required.The Biewer Terrier is small in stature which does not make them ideal for extreme conditions and weather, regardless of their coat. Their long coat might be helpful during the winter months, with a haircut to shorten when summer rolls around.","The Biewer Terrier is a small dog so they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Though they can get along with small children, it’s best to make sure they learn and understand early how to properly approach and play with a small dog. These pups can get along with virtually everyone including adults, older kids, and senior citizens. The Biewer Terrier can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, the Biewer Terrier needs time to socialize in order to feel comfortable.

They can go for miles before looking up and realizing that home is nowhere to be found.Makes a good jogging or running companion but is also more than satisfied with 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise, and walks that allow for plenty of sniffing time.This breed does well with children, but is active and bouncy when young.Easily gains weight if given the chance.Can be stubborn and independent, making training a challenge.A bored Coonhound is a noisy, destructive Coonhound. He needs lots human companionship and training.Obedience training is highly recommended and likely to lead to a closer relationship with your dog.Never buy a Black and Tan Coonhound from a puppy broker or pet store. Reputable breeders do not sell to middlemen or retailers, and there are no guarantees as to whether the puppy had healthy parents. Interview breeders thoroughly, and make sure the puppy's parents have been screened for genetic diseases pertinent to that breed. Ask breeders about the health issues they've encountered in their dogs, and don't believe anyone who claims that her dogs never have any health problems. Ask for references so you can contact other puppy buyers to see if they're happy with their Coonhound. Doing your homework may save you a lot of heartbreak later.","The largest of the six coonhound breeds, Black and Tans range in weight from 75 to 100 pounds. Males stand 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder, females 23 to 25 inches.","This working scenthound was bred to work closely with other hounds, so he knows how to go along and get along with canine pals. With people he doesn't know, he might be reserved but never shy or vicious.He can be headstrong and likes to have his own way, but with firm, consistent, patient training the Black and Tan Coonhound is a well-mannered companion, albeit one who's slow to mature. Expect to have a fun-loving puppy on your hands for at least three years.At home he's an easygoing friend, but put him on a scent trail and he's as serious as a heart attack. This compulsion to follow his nose means you won't ever want to have him off leash unless you're in an enclosed area.","As with all breeds, the Black and Tan Coonhound can be prone to certain health conditions.Following are some conditions that can affect Black and Tan Coonhounds:Hip Dysplasia (HD): This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Cataracts. A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Note: Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least two years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed.Both parents should have health clearances, documentation that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Black and Tan Coonhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better) and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site.Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than two years of age. That's because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it's often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.","Being a pack dog, the Black and Tan Coonhound is among the few breeds who can adjust to kennel life and even live outdoors — if it's not too cold, he's with another social dog, and he's given warm, dry shelter. But if he's an only dog, he should live indoors with his human pack so he doesn't get lonely.If you do keep him outside, make it during the day only and bring him in at night. He'll need a large fenced yard since hounds are the original ""travelin' man"" and will roam for miles if they catch whiff of an interesting scent. A fence keeps your Black and Tan Coonhound safely at home.Note: An underground electronic fencing isn't strong enough to contain him.Because of his tendency to wander, it's essential that a Coonhound be tattooed and microchipped and always wear a collar with identification tags.Coonhounds are big enough to countersurf, and they'll eat anything you leave within reach. Put the garbage up high, and don't leave pies, bread, roasts, or any other goodies cooling on the counter, or they'll be gone when you turn your head.It is important to crate train your Coonhound puppy. Puppies explore, get into things they shouldn't, and chew stuff that can harm them. It can be expensive both to fix and replace destroyed items, not to mention the vet bills. Crate training ensures not only the safety of your puppy but that of your belongings.While they're mainly sweet and easygoing, Black and Tan Coonhounds have the independent and stubborn nature common to hounds. They've been bred to work on their own, and don't necessarily see why they should have to do things your way. On the plus side, they generally housetrain quickly.Obedience training is highly recommended, but don't count on perfect compliance. This is a dog who enjoys putting his own spin on obedience commands. Use treats and positive reinforcement techniques to persuade your Black and Tan that he wants to do as you ask.And ""ask"" is the operative word. Hounds will flat-out ignore you if you try to boss them around.

One brushing per week should get the job done.The breed is incredibly loyal to its human family, especially children, though its tendency to play rough may make it ill suited for very young children.There are several different breeders of Black Mouth Curs who may produce differences in size, coat, and personality traits.Black Mouth Curs require a trainer that is able to maintain a firm hand, but these dogs are highly sensitive and do not respond to harsh rebukes. Training sessions should be thorough and productive, yet short enough to keep the dog's attention. This breed is not the best choice for inexperienced owners.The Black Mouth Cur is energetic and requires a yard to run and burn off energy, as well as a bare minimum of one long walk per day. Anything less may result in boredom and destructive behavior. Black Mouth Curs are not apartment dogs.Black Mouth Curs are considered to be generally healthy dogs and are less prone to several of the conditions that plague other purebreds, though they do have some genetic predispositions that owners should be aware of and watch out for.In the novel Old Yeller, the titular dog is a Black Mouth Cur, though the dog who played Old Yeller in the 1957 film adaptation was a Labrador Retriever and Mastiff mix named Spike.","There can be much variation in size when it comes to Black Mouth Curs depending on breeding, and dogs within the same litter can be of different sizes, as well. Males tend to be larger, weighing in on average between 40 and 95 pounds, while females tend to range from 35 to 80 pounds. The breed is usually 16 inches in height or taller. Sometimes the purpose for which the dog has been bred factors into their size. Tree dogs range from 35 to 50 pounds, while herding dogs can weigh over 100 pounds.","The history of the Black Mouth Cur has had a heavy influence on which traits have been kept in the breed. Settlers needed a dog that could suit all of their needs, rather than focusing on a specific task. Black Mouth Curs are known to be courageous and never back down from a fight, which was useful in warding off predators of the American south, including wildcats, bears, and other animals. They have retained this fearlessness to modern times.Settlers also needed a dog that would be intelligent that could help them hunt for food and valuable pelts. They needed a dog that would be a loyal and dedicated family companion so that it would protect the homestead. They needed a dog that would be strong and able to handle life in the rugged frontier. All of these traits remain with the modern Black Mouth Cur.They were also bred to have a high energy level appropriate for long days of hard work, so it is important for Black Mouth Curs to get a good deal of exercise. They don't do well in apartments or sitting on a couch all day. A yard to run around and at least one long walk per day are essential, as anything less can lead to boredom, anxiety, and destructive behavior.When it comes to training, the Black Mouth Cur can be stubborn, but an overly harsh approach does not work for this sensitive breed. They need a trainer who will be firm and lay down the law, but also won't raise their voice in anger or frustration. Black Mouth Curs are eager to please, but they will also get bored if training sessions are too long or repetitive, and their attention may drift. Short, focused training sessions are best.","The Black Mouth Cur is considered to be a generally healthy breed with fewer of the genetic problems that tend to affect other breeds and a lifespan that usually goes well into its teens. Still, there are a few conditions that they are predisposed to. Owners should watch out for these conditions throughout their dogs' lives. Some of the conditions that might affect Black Mouth Curs include ear infections, epilepsy, mange, hip dysplasia, and cataracts.","It is important to care for a Black Mouth Cur's ears, as they can trap dirt, water, and debris, leading to ear infections and other complications. This is especially true of dogs that like to play outdoors in water or in humid areas. Frequent, thorough ear cleanings are a must to prevent infection. They should also regularly have their eyes and bone health checked during routine vet visits to spot signs of cataracts, hip dysplasia, or other eye and skeletal conditions. Their teeth should be brushed regularly and professionally cleaned as needed. Your veterinarian can advise you further on what kind of care you should provide for your Black Mouth Cur.","A healthy diet for a Black Mouth Cur can vary depending on the dog's size and the activities they participate in throughout the day. Working dogs that hunt or round up livestock, for example, need food that will provide them with adequate energy while they are performing their daily tasks. Dogs that stay at home and get moderate exercise have different needs. Typically, Black Mouth Curs need two quality meals per day.Your veterinarian should be able to help you determine an appropriate diet for your Black Mouth Cur based on their size and energy requirements. Make sure they get balanced meals, and you may wish to consult a nutritionist to advise you on what to feed your dog.","The appearance of Black Mouth Curs can vary depending on breeding, and even individuals of the same litter can look very different. Their coats are short and can either be course or fine. They can be red, yellow, black, brown, or brindle. Most have some black fur on their muzzle, the trademark that gives the breed its name, but not all of them do. Some may have the appearance of a mask around their face and eyes. Patches of white may appear on the face, chest, legs, or tail. Their eyes may be green, yellow, or brown.Black Mouth Cur coats shed moderately throughout the year and a bit more heavily before winter and summer. Generally, they need very little care. One brushing per week should be fine, and many Black Mouth Curs can go their whole lives without having their coats professionally groomed. They will need regular nail trimmings, and it's important to keep their face and ears clean, especially where there are folds in the skin as these places can harbor bacteria, parasites, or debris.","The breed can be friendly to other dogs, especially if socialization training begins early. This is necessary because Black Mouth Curs can be territorial and respond to strangers or other dogs with aggression if they feel that they or their families are threatened. They are usually fine with another resident dog, though their high prey drive makes them unsuitable for homes with smaller pets, such as cats, rabbits, hamsters, etc.Black Mouth Curs need human interaction and companionship, and they are great with families and kids. As with all dogs, children should be supervised when playing with Black Mouth Curs, as they like to roughhouse and may not know that they need to be gentler with youngsters. It is important to teach children how to interact with dogs appropriately, as well, to avoid injuring them during play.","If you wish to rescue and adopt a Black Mouth Cur, you can check out this website that lists available Black Mouth Curs by state, or you can check out our adoption page that lets you search by zip code and breed for any kind of dog that you're interested in.",not available

Their job as your companion could be competing in agility, obedience, Schutzhund, or various canine sports.Black Russian Terriers need at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. They are intelligent and powerful, and exercise provides a needed outlet. A Black Russian can manage in an apartment with sufficient outdoor exercise. A fenced yard is best for the Blackie living in a house.They do bark and shed, but not very much.Blackies enjoy the company of their families and prefer to stick close to their human pack. They don't do well stuck in the backyard by themselves.The sometimes stubborn Blackie needs firm training as soon as you get them home so that they won't try to establish themselves as the leader of the pack.Blackies are by nature aloof with people they don't know, and unless they have regular exposure to lots of different people--ideally beginning in puppyhood--they can become overly protective of you around strangers.

Purposely designed to guard and protect, Blackies could become dangerous without their famous emotional stability.Highly intelligent, Blackies take well to firm direction and need a job to perform, so training is easy. Start early to offset a potential sense of overprotection. Blackies love children and will guard those in their circle. They're house dogs and need to feel like part of the family--they aren't not suited to life in the backyard. Blackies need almost constant attention and guidance, and they'll become withdrawn if you don't give them enough.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them.Meeting the parent dogs, siblings, or other blood relatives can helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when they grow up, but it's no guarantee.Like every dog, the Black Russian Terrier needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Blackie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. The more properly socialized Blackies are, the better they are with other dogs, although some will only enjoy other canine companions who live in their household.Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking them to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help them polish their social skills.","Blackies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Blackies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Here are a few conditions you and your vet should keep an eye out for:Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Black Russian Terrier is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.","Your Blackie needs daily exercise and mental stimulation, at least half an hour each day, including walks, runs, disc games, obedience, or agility.Hanging out alone in the back yard is not exercise; even if that's what you intended, your Blackie will just spend the time at the door waiting to be let back in. They have a great need for human contact, so they're always happier when you're hanging out with them. When you're not playing with your companion, puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes are a great way to keep that active mind occupied.The Blackie can live in an apartment as long as they have adequate exercise. In a single-family dwelling, they should have a fenced yard.Puppies don't need as much hard exercise as adults, and, in fact, you shouldn't let them run on hard surfaces such as concrete or let them do a lot of jumping until they're at least a year to eighteen months old. Otherwise large-breed pups like the Blackie may stress their still-developing skeletal systems, which can cause future joint problems.Obedience classes can help you curb your Blackie's behavior, as they help satisfy his need for mental stimulation and work. They'll respond well to training methods that use positive reinforcement--rewards such as praise, play, and food--and is likely to happily take commands from their trainer. They just need to know who's in charge.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Blackie doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things they shouldn't. A crate is also a place where they can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Blackie accept confinement if they ever need to be boarded or hospitalized.Your Blackie doesn't want to spend all day in a crate, however. It's not a jail, and they shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when they're sleeping at night. Blackies are people-oriented dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives alone or in a crate.","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on their size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Blackie in good shape by measuring their food and feeding them twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether they're overweight, give them the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at them. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on their back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, they need less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Blackie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Blackies have black coats, but a sprinkling of gray hair can sometimes be seen, even in puppies. They have a double coat, and the outer coat is coarse, with the undercoat soft and thick. It varies in length from 1.5 to 4 inches. Blackies have a tousled coat, although some might be tempted to call it wiry or curly.Brushing is a weekly event for Blackies: they need regular and frequent maintenance to prevent matting. To brush that coat, you'll want a slicker brush, an undercoat rake, and a stripping comb. You can find any of these grooming tools in a good pet supply store. Blackies don't shed a lot, but those dogs with longer coats may leave little clumps of hair everywhere unless brushed regularly.The eyebrows, moustache, and beard can be left alone and aren't trimmed. Show grooming for Blackies is a fairly involved task, but if your companion isn't showing in conformation, the coat can be clipped twice a year for manageability. You can clip your companion yourself; it takes a little practice but it's not difficult.If you keep them brushed, your Blackie should need a bath only when they're dirty. Use a shampoo made for dogs to avoid drying out their skin and coat. The Blackie beard soaks up water which they can then spray liberally around the house, so the beard may need a little extra attention during grooming.Brush your Blackie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding--and your dog may not cooperate the next time they see the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Their ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Blackie to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. Handle their paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside their mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Despite their impressive size, Blackies are great with children and will protect them. Females seem more willing to play with children than the males, but both sexes treat children with whom they are raised with gentleness and respect. Don't forget, however, that Blackies are large and active companions, and extremely young children may be accidentally knocked over or injured by a playful and energetic dog of this size. Use caution with very young children.Blackies who have not been exposed to children from puppyhood may not be as tolerant--something to consider if you're looking to add an older or rescue dog to your household.Either way, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Make sure your Blackie is well socialized as a puppy and adult so that they don't become overprotective of their family and property.Male Black Russians don't do well with other dominant dogs. Many of them aren't suited to dog parks for this reason. At home, they do best with other canine companions who were already established in the house. They will be fine with non-dominant or small dogs, as well as cats, horses, rabbits, and other pets.","Blackies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Blackies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Blackie rescue.Black Russian Terrier Club of America, Inc.","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Black Russian Terrier.Black Russian Terrier Club of America"

Bloodhounds are working dogs and need long daily walks or runs.Bloodhounds are not suited for apartment living. They do best in a home with a large fenced yard.Bloodhounds are pack dogs and will enjoy the company of other dogs. A cat will do in a pinch.Bloodhounds slobber and shed. Keep baby wipes or hand towels on hand throughout the house, and brush them weekly or more often if needed.Bloodhounds love and are extremely tolerant with them. Teach children how to treat a Bloodhound properly and supervise play between them. Bloodhounds may be too large for toddlers; they can knock them down with a single swipe of the tail.Bloodhounds need a fenced yard. This is not an option but a necessity. If they come across an interesting scent, they will follow it, head down, nose to the ground, eyes covered by their wonderful ears, oblivious to traffic and other dangers.For the same reason you need a fenced yard, you need to walk a Bloodhound on leash.Known for their stubbornness, Bloodhounds need an owner who is firm, loving, and consistent. A Bloodhound who is mistreated or feels he is mistreated will pout and hide. Bloodhounds do well with positive reinforcement training.Bloodhounds are prone to recurring ear infections. Routinely check their ears and clean them on a regular basis.Bloodhounds will chew and swallow the most unimaginable items, from rocks and plants to batteries and TV remotes.When they're not following a trail, Bloodhounds prefer to live indoors with the family.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",The male Bloodhound stands 25 to 27 inches tall and weighs 90 to 110 pounds; females are 23 to 25 inches and 80 to 100 pounds.,"The dignified Bloodhound is a study in contradictions. He's docile yet stubborn, determined but not quarrelsome, affectionate but somewhat shy with people he doesn't know. When it comes to training, he's sensitive to kindness or correction, but he still wants to do things his way.He can sniff out the slightest hint of a trail, but as a watchdog or guard dog, he's poor, given his love of people. Some Bloodhounds can be vocal, barking up a storm when they're excited. Others are nice and quiet.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Bloodhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bloodhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start.

Not all Bloodhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Bloodhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or weight management or anti-inflammatory medication to control the pain.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog's fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life.Ectropion: Ectropion is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritation and infection. If ectropion is severe, it can be corrected surgically.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Bloodhound has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if needed when the dog matures.Epilepsy: This seizure disorder, which can be hereditary, acquired, or of unknown cause, can be managed with medication, but it can't be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disease.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Fold Dermatitis: This skin infection is caused by friction or trapped moisture in the folds of the skin. The signs of fold dermatitis are redness, sores, and odor, usually on the tail, face, lips, vulvar folds, and any fold on the body. The treatment for Fold Dermatitis can vary depending on the area that is affected but it can include surgical removal of the folds or amputation of the tail in the case of fold dermatitis on the tail. It can also include topical ointments, antibiotics. The best means of treatment is to properly maintain your dog's coat and subsequent folds to prevent the condition.","Bloodhounds should be indoor/outdoor dogs who have frequent interaction with their people. They are best suited to homes with large fenced yards. Many are escape artists and require fences at least six feet high. Underground electronic fences will not contain a Bloodhound. His desire to follow a scent is far stronger than the fear of a momentary shock.It was once said that Bloodhound people always have one arm that's longer than the other. That's because this breed is a strong puller, thanks to his nose dragging him forward as he follows a trail. Your Bloodhound can learn to walk nicely on a leash, and he must be leashed when outside the yard to prevent him from taking off to find the source of an interesting smell.Bloodhounds need long daily walks and are capable of going for miles. If you live in the country or enjoy hiking, this is the breed for you. They can make great jogging buddies. You may also wish to train your Bloodhound for search and rescue work or tracking tests.Like all breeds, a Bloodhound puppy's exercise should be limited until he reaches physical maturity. The rule of thumb is 5 minutes for every month of age; therefore, a 3-month-old puppy should be exercised for only 15 minutes a day, a 4-month-old for 20 minutes, and so on. Know your dog's signs of fatigue.Bloodhound puppies are nosy, curious, and into everything. Crate training is highly recommended. Not only will it keep them out of trouble and save your belongings from destruction, it's an excellent aid to housetraining. This breed is easily housetrained, but a crate will help him learn to control his bladder and bowels.Your adult Bloodhound is just the right height to go counter-surfing, so keep food well out of reach. A swipe of his long, tapering tail can clear a coffee table. You might want to put breakables elsewhere.Bloodhounds of all ages are chewers and will chew on anything that smells good or looks interesting. Be diligent in letting your Bloodhound know what's okay to chew and what isn't. He still might eat your lawn furniture, but if you've provided him with plenty of chew toys and exercise, he's somewhat less likely to do so.When it comes to training, Bloodhounds are highly intelligent but independent, with a ""What's in it for me?"" attitude. Be consistent in what you permit or don't permit, or your Bloodhound will constantly test whether you really mean what you say. Be patient and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise and food rewards.Keep training sessions short, about 15 minutes, and always end them when your Bloodhound has done something well and you can praise him for it. Give firm but gentle corrections, never harsh verbal or physical punishment. Most important, remember this bit of advice: Never tell a Bloodhound what to do, ask him.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 8 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.Bloodhounds are messy eaters, so you may want to tuck the ears into a snood before mealtime. Choose water dishes with a narrow diameter to help keep the ears from dragging in them.Bloodhounds are prone to gastric torsion, also known as bloat. Factors that contribute to bloat include eating a large meal and then drinking large amounts of water, heavy exercise directly before or after a meal, giving food in raised feeding dishes, and stress. Keep these things in mind when you feed your Bloodhound.For more on feeding your Bloodhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Bloodhound's coat is loose and thin to the touch. Around the neck and head, it hangs in deep folds. As the head hangs down, the skin falls into loose, pendulous ridges and folds, especially over the forehead and sides of the face. These wrinkles, combined with the loose, pendulous skin beneath the neck and throat (known as the dewlap) and the long, sweeping ears, help funnel scent from the ground up to the Bloodhound's nose and hold it there.Bloodhound colors are black and tan, liver and tan, and red. The darker colors are sometimes interspersed with lighter or badger-colored hair (a mixture of white, gray, brown, and black) or flecked with white. You may see a small amount of white on the chest, feet, and tail tip, known as the stern.Brush your Bloodhound weekly, or more often if you prefer, with a rubber hound mitt. He sheds seasonally, and during that time you may want to use a shedding blade to remove excess hair. Remember that his skin is thin and be gentle.Clean his wrinkles daily to prevent bacterial infections. Wipe them out with a damp washcloth and then dry them thoroughly. Do the same for the flews (the hanging part of the upper lip) after every meal.A Bloodhound's ears seem to be specially designed for trapping dirt and breeding yeast and bacteria, making them prone to infection. Clean them weekly with a solution recommended by your veterinarian. Hold the ear up so you can see the ear canal. Squeeze in a large amount of ear cleaner, lower the ear flap, and gently massage the liquid into the ear. You will hear a swooshing sound, and your Bloodhound will probably moan with pleasure.Now take a cotton ball and wipe the debris outward from the outer ear canal. (Don't insert it any further than the first knuckle of your finger.) Let the dog shake his head and repeat the wipedown with a clean cotton ball. Every time your Bloodhound shakes his head, it pulls out more debris from deep within the ear canal. Repeat the wiping until the cotton ball is no longer dirty. Never dig around in the ears with a cotton swab; you could easily damage them.If your Bloodhound's ears develop an infection despite your best efforts, have your veterinarian test the dog to determine the cause of the infection. Then he or she can prescribe the most effective antibiotic to clear it up.The Bloodhound's need for ear care can be a big deterrent for some prospective owners and is something you should take into consideration. If you don't have time to properly care for a Bloodhound, including the time it takes to ensure clean ears, then this breed may not be for you.The only other grooming a Bloodhound needs is dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Bloodhound's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Bloodhound to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

That said, they are large, active dogs and can accidentally knock a toddler down with a swipe of the tail. They're best suited to homes with older children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.In general, Bloodhounds are quite friendly with other dogs, although a few have issues with small dogs.

Still, full recognition may be many years off or never come at all.Blue Lacys are very intelligent and respond well to training, but they need an assertive trainer who can lay down the law without being overly punitive.This breed is hardworking and does best when given a task. They are capable of hunting, herding, agility training, watchdog work, or even search and rescue.Mental and physical stimulation are must-haves. Blue Lacys need multiple runs and walks per day to burn off their energy. They appreciate having open space to run around, rather than small apartments.","The Blue Lacy tends to be between 17 and 25 inches in height at the shoulder. On average, males are larger than females and weigh between 35 to 55 pounds, while females usually weigh between 25 and 45 pounds. Individuals of  the breed may be larger or smaller, as well.","The combination of intelligence and high energy that make up the Blue Lacy dog breed's personality can either cause them to be well-trained working dogs or destructive forces of nature depending on how much mental and physical stimulation they get. Blue Lacys cannot be cooped up for long, and when they get bored, they'll make their own fun in whatever way they can, even if it means chewing or digging in things they aren't supposed to. They will need long runs each day, and probably additional exercise. Training goes a long way, and Blue Lacys respond to firm, positive training very well, though they are sensitive and will not respond well to yelling or punishment. Training is a must for Blue Lacys, and socialization must begin early to overcome their natural prey drive and territorial nature. If they are not socialized early, Blue Lacys can be standoffish to strangers and downright aggressive to other pets and animals. They are, however, very kind and protective toward their families, even children, and you'd have a difficult time finding a better watchdog. Because they were bred to help hunt and tree small game, they do have a tendency to bark, and it can take a while to get them to quiet down once they get going. They should not be left alone for long periods of time. When properly exercised and trained, the Blue Lacy makes an excellent family companion that is very loyal and loving. They do best when they have a job where they can spend their physical and mental energy. When they have something to do that provides them with an adequate challenge, Blue Lacys are calm, sweet members of the household.","The Blue Lacy is generally a healthy and hardy breed, though they are sometimes genetically prone to a few health conditions. Blue Lacys are known to occasionally suffer from hip or elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and food allergies. They may also develop skin conditions, and though it is rare, some may be born with color dilution alopecia, a condition that can cause hair loss in patches or over the entire body.","Care for Blue Lacys is fairly standard. Their nails should be trimmed monthly or as needed to prevent overgrowth. Their teeth should be brushed regularly, and you should ask your veterinarian about dental care for your individual dog. Their ears should be checked often for debris, ticks, parasites, or signs of illness and cleaned as needed.",A Blue Lacy diet should be formulated for a mid-sized breed with high energy and intense exercise requirements. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Blue Lacy and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"The Blue Lacy can come in three color varieties, despite their name. ""Blues"" range from gray to almost black. ""Reds"" can be anywhere between a light, cream color to a reddish-brown, rust color. ""Tris"" are tri-colored and have a blue base coat with red markings and white along the belly, chin, or paws. Their coat colors tend to make their yellow or amber eyes stand out beautifully.The Blue Lacy's coat is short and smooth. There is not much, if any, undercoat. Blue Lacys shed an average amount, though the shedding is more heavy seasonally. They require little grooming. A weekly brushing should suffice, and they should be bathed as needed.","Blue Lacys are generally good with children and are not usually aggressive. They are loyal family dogs and very protective of their humans. However, they do have high energy levels and can sometimes be known to play rough. For that reason, they may not be suited for homes with very young children that can be easily knocked over or accidentally hurt during rough play.Blue Lacys have a high prey drive, which can make them dangerous around small animals and other pets. They are usually fine if they are raised alongside other animals and recognize them to be family. They can also be tolerant of other dogs if they are socialized from a very young age. That said, it may be best if there are no other small animals or pets in the home, and owners would do well to make sure that neighboring pets do not enter the Blue Lacys territory, as their instincts may take over and lead to an incident.","If you are interested in adopting a Blue Lacy dog, you can check out Texas Lacy Rehome Group on Facebook, which is a group that regularly posts about adoptable Blue Lacy dogs that need to find good homes.

Boerboel,2,1,1,3,2,3,4,3,4,4,2,2,4,3,4,4,4,3,5,3,2,4,3,3,3,4,3,4,4,4,Working Dogs,22 to 28 inches,110 to 200 pounds,10 to 12 years,"The Boerboel is a massive dog and incredibly muscular. They weigh as much as Great Danes, even though they are significantly shorter in stature.There is much speculation about which breeds were bred together to make the modern Boerboel, but their exact ancestry is not well known.Dutch settlers brought dogs to South Africa to defend farms from big cats and other wildlife. Only the strongest dogs were able to survive the harsh climate and conditions in South Africa, and they became some of the ancestors of the modern Boerboel.After the World Wars, breeding wasn't regulated, and the Boerboel almost completely disappeared. It has made a resurgence after breed enthusiasts began an effort to restore the Boerboel in the 1980s.Boerboels are known to be especially loving and protective of their human children. They are excellent guardians, though they can be overprotective.The Boerboel has minimal grooming needs and few health concerns, though their need for training and socialization makes them a poor choice for novice owners.Since Boerboels have been revived in South Africa, they have grown in popularity and have been exported around the world. Even so, they are still considered to be a more rare breed.Although they average between 110 and 200 pounds, it is not unheard of for Boerboels to weigh well over 200 pounds.The Boerboel is considered to be the most agile of the Mastiff type dogs.Socialization is necessary for Boerboels, as they can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially those of the same sex and breed.","Boerboels are large dogs with males averaging 24 to 28 inches in height at the shoulder, while females tend to be between 22 and 25 inches in height. Boerboels usually weigh between 110 and 200 pounds, though some can be larger or smaller.","Boerboels are playful, intelligent, and eager to please. They are happiest when given a job to do, whether it's tough farm work, guard dog duty, or preparing for a competition where they can show off their agility and strength. This breed loves human family members, even children, though they are quite overprotective at times. The same instincts that make them good watchdogs and protectors can also make them fiercely territorial and aggressive if they aren't trained or socialized properly. When having guests over, it is important for a family member to introduce them to the resident Boerboel so the dog doesn't feel threatened. Usually Boerboels are welcoming of guests that they've met and trust, though they may still be on their guard. When it comes to training, Boerboels tend to be dominant and require an assertive trainer who will use positive reinforcement and set boundaries without being harsh. This is not a dog for first time owners. Patient, consistent training should be accompanied by early socialization to prevent aggression, and Boerboels should get plenty of mental and physical stimulation, as they can get bored and anxious, which will lead to destructive behavior. Long walks, vigorous play sessions, and challenging devices like puzzle feeders can all help them get the activity they need. Being a large dog breed with moderate exercise demands, Boerboels require space, so an apartment is not their ideal environment. They do best in a home with a backyard and a high, durable fence that will give them plenty of space to safely run around. While these dogs are not for novices, they will reward the right owners by being adoring family companions that will defend their homes and humans at all costs.","The Boerboel is generally considered to be a healthy breed with few known hereditary conditions. There are, however, a few ailments that they are predisposed to and may develop over the course of their lives. They may suffer from hip or elbow dysplasia, heart disease, conditions that affect the eyelids, vaginal hyperplasia, and bloat. Rarely, they may also suffer from juvenile epilepsy. If you see signs of any of these conditions in your Boerboel, you should consult your veterinarian immediately.","The Boerboel's main need when it comes to care is to be mentally and physically stimulated through exercise and play. Beyond that, regular care is fairly simple. Their nails should be trimmed about once every two weeks, and their teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Boerboels' ears should be checked for debris and wax buildup weekly and cleaned as needed to avoid infection or infestation by pests.",A Boerboel diet should be formulated for a large to giant breed with moderate to high exercise requirements. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Boerboel and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"Boerboels have short, straight overcoats that are smooth and shiny, which cover their soft, dense undercoats. They can be shades of red, fawn, brown, brindle, or black. Some have spots of white on their coat, especially around the neck, face, and paws, though it is considered a fault if more than 30 percent of the coat is white. Many Boerboels have dark markings around their eyes, mouths, and noses, and some have dark patches around their paws. The coat sheds an average amount and doesn't require much care. Weekly brushing and monthly baths should help catch the shedding fur and keep the coat healthy.","Boerboels love their human families and are especially known for being protectors of their children. That said, they are large, playful dogs and may knock over a child by accident if things get out of hand. Children should be trained on how to interact with animals to avoid incident, as well. No poking and prodding, no matter how trained and docile a Boerboel may be. As with any dog, play time should be supervised. The Boerboel's natural protective instinct may also be an issue when children have playmates over, as the Boerboel may interpret play as aggression and defend its family. That said, this is a breed that is known for absolutely adoring the human children within the family, and you couldn't ask for a better kid protector than a gigantic, agile Boerboel. When it comes to other dogs, Boerboels do well with animals that they have been raised with and live in the same household, but they can be quite territorial and standoffish with unfamiliar dogs. They can also become competitive and aggressive with other Boerboels of the same sex. Early socialization can help keep the breed's confrontational instincts in check, but they may be best suited to a home where they are the only dog.","If you're interested in adopting a Boerboel, you can check out U.S.A.

They are not purebreds like their Boston Terrier or Beagle parents.While one of the most predominant colors Bolgen Terriers come in is brindle, they can also be brindle and white, black and white, brown and white, and rarely tri-colored.Bolgen Terriers usually have short coats and are not considered allergy friendly, though their coats are very easy to groom.Because of their pack dog heritage, Boglen Terriers enjoy company and don't like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat may help meet their companionship needs.Boglen Terriers have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.They tend to only be vocal when a doorbell rings or they spot something outside but rarely howl like their Beagle parent.","As with all mixes, the pups may take on one parent's size more so than the other, but the Boglen is considered a small breed dog just like its parents. Most Boglens weigh in at ten to 40 pounds and range in height from twelve to 17 inches.Since both parent breeds tend to become overweight easily, you should discuss with your veterinarian what the appropriate weight is for your dog's size.","Many Boglen Terrier lovers describe these dogs' personalities as ""playful."" Although they are the size of your average lap dog, their high energy levels mean they'd probably prefer a game of fetch to a cuddle session. Make sure you have a secure yard as they are prone to wandering off.Boglen Terriers are gentle, sweet, and funny. They will make you laugh with their non-stop antics and silly behavior.Especially being part Beagle, these dogs can often times be stubborn and very scent driven, meaning it is not a good idea to keep your Boglen off leash. Patience is necessary when training begins and as stated before, they are extremely food driven which makes training easier. Boglen Terrier people spend a lot of time trying to out-think their dogs, and they often must resort to food rewards to lure them into a state of temporary obedience.Both parent breeds are intelligent, quick learners, and eager to please, so training these dogs will be easy as long as you are firm and consistent.Like every dog, the Boglen Terrier needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Boglen Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.The outgoing nature of the Boglen makes it a perfect dog for someone who is active and can give the pup plenty of attention. They adore kids and make excellent family dogs that will be able to keep up with the energy of a child. They'll enjoy a game of fetch just as much as an interactive brain stimulating toy or a long walk with their owner.Since these dogs get so attached to their owners, they are often not best left alone for very extended periods of time as they can be destructive if not kept busy. The best way to prevent this is to start young with getting your puppy used to your routine, especially if owners work all day.These dogs are notorious for their loyalty and, despite their size, make excellent watch dogs. They are not considered yappy but will let their owner know if a stranger is at the door.","The Boglen breed is a generally very hardy dog that has had several health problems lessened by being crossbred. For example, the Boston Terrier has a short snout and bulging eyes. The elongated snout from the Beagle helps ease breathing issues and with eyes more like a Beagle's, they are less prone to a condition called Cherry-eye.The Boglen Terrier breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Beagle and Boston Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Boglen Terriers suffer from include:Ear InfectionsObesityDry SkinSkin AllergiesInverterbral Disk DiseaseHip DysplasiaCataractsPatellar Luxation","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Boglen Terrier's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Boglen Terriers are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in. Luckily, their high energy levels make it easier for them to keep off extra weight with appropriate exercise.The ears of a Boglen are often floppy, so it is important that owners check and clean the ears daily to prevent infections. Check their ears for debris and pests and clean them as recommended by your vet. This breed is prone to ear infections. If your dog develops a pungent aroma, chances are they may have an ear infection and may require a trip to the vet.Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this if it's too difficult to do by yourself.Your main concern when it comes to your Boglen Terrier's care will be maintaining their oral health. The length of the Boglen's snout may differ among each dog, but in general, the teeth of small breed dogs are known to be prone to dental issues, and it's best to start to brush your pup's teeth when they are young to get them used to it.As they grow, you should brush their teeth daily. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly. Dental chews are also helpful. Please note, if your dog eats their dental chew in under ten minutes, it may not be very helpful for cleaning their teeth.","An ideal Boglen Terrier diet should be formulated for a small, active breed. Beagles and Boston Terriers are notorious for being very food driven and tend to become overweight quite easily, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and limit treats.As with all dogs, the Boglen Terrier's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Boglen Terrier's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Boglen Terrier coats are often a mix of their Beagle and Boston Terrier parents' coats and colors. While one of the most predominant colors they come in is brindle, they can also be brindle and white, black and white, brown and white, and rarely tri-colored.They usually have short coats and are not considered allergy friendly, though their coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do.One very common issue with short, smooth-coated breeds is that they tend to get dry skin rather easily. Boglens are considered light shedders due to their short fine hair, but excessive shedding may occur in stressful situations.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Boglen Terriers aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog. While their short coat can keep them cool in the heat, you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.","Boglen Terriers bond with everyone in the family, especially children. They can be rambunctious when playing, however, so they need to be properly socialized and supervised with very young children.In addition, Boglens may be ""mouthy,"" grabbing things, including your or your child's hand, with their mouths to play. They do this in fun and can be trained not to do this. Sometimes when puppies are teething, children need to understand that nibbles from a pup aren't aggressive towards them. These dogs love kids and will quickly bond and become excellent playmates.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Because of their pack dog heritage, Boglen Terriers enjoy company and don't like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat may help meet their companionship needs. Boglens generally get along with other dogs, as well as cats, as long as they are socialized young.Of course, personalities may clash but several Boglen owners say their dogs get along well with any size breed. One owner DogTime spoke with said her Boglen will often challenge larger breed dogs. Boglens are highly social animals and certainly won't mind sharing the household with other pets and children as well.Every dog's personality is different, so the real key to getting your pup used to different situations is early training and socialization. Make sure to expose them to other dogs, cats, children, and strangers when they are young so they will be highly adaptable.Learn more about this awesome mixed breed by reading about their parents, the Beagle and Boston Terrier.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Boglen Terriers because they are a mixed breed.

Otherwise he'll invent his own games — and he can become a problem to live with.The Border Collie will herd anything that moves, including children, cars, people on bikes, cats, and squirrels. He can become a real problem if he's allowed to roam in a neighborhood; a securely fenced yard is essential.The noisy play of young children can stimulate the Border Collie's herding instinct and cause him to nip, nudge, and bark.To prevent shyness, the Border Collie must be well socialized.The Border Collie doesn't usually roam, but his curiosity and intelligence can lead him to become an escape artist.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 19 to 22 inches tall and weigh 35 to 45 pounds. Females stand 18 to 21 inches and weigh 30 to 40 pounds.,"Quite simply, the Border Collie is a dynamo. His personality is characteristically alert, energetic, hardworking, and smart. He learns quickly — so quickly that it's sometimes difficult to keep him challenged.This breed likes to be busy. In fact, he must be busy or he becomes bored, which leads to annoying behavior, such as barking, digging, or chasing cars. He's not a dog to lie quietly on the front porch while you sip a glass of lemonade; he thrives on activity. Remember, he was bred to run and work all day herding sheep.The Border Collie is also renowned for being highly sensitive to his handler's every cue, from a whistle to a hand signal to a raised eyebrow.Of course, the Border Collie isn't perfect. He can be strong-minded and independent, and his compulsion to herd can become misdirected. In the absence of sheep, or some kind of job, he is apt to gather and chase children, cars, or pets.He can also become fearful or shy if he isn't properly socialized as a puppy. Puppy classes and plenty of exposure to a variety of people, places, and things help the sensitive Border Collie gain confidence.","Border Collies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Border Collies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Border Collies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. Epilepsy can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Collie Eye Anomaly: This is an inherited condition that causes changes and abnormalities in the eye, which can sometimes lead to blindness. These changes can include choroidal hypoplasia (an abnormal development of the choroids), coloboma (a defect in the optic disc), staphyloma (a thinning of the sclera), and retinal detachment. Collie eye anomaly usually occurs by the time the dog is two years old. There is no treatment for the condition.Allergies: There are three main types of allergies in dogs: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.","While the Border Collie is a highly adaptable dog, he's best suited to an environment that gives him some elbow room: a city home with a securely fenced yard, or a country farm or ranch. Because he has a propensity to herd and chase, he must be protected from his not-so-bright instinct to chase cars.Regardless of the environment, he requires a great deal of mental and physical stimulation every day, and he needs an owner who is willing and able to provide that. This can be a great burden to owners who don't know what they're getting into. If you're considering a Border Collie, make sure you can provide him with a proper outlet for his natural energy and bright mind. If you don't have a farm with sheep, dog sports are a good alternative.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Border Collie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Border Collie breed boasts two varieties of coat: rough and smooth. Both are double coats, with a coarser outer coat and soft undercoat. The rough variety is medium length with feathering on the legs, chest, and belly. The smooth variety is short all over, usually coarser in texture than the rough variety, and feathering is minimal.His coat is most often black with a white blaze on the face, neck, feet, legs, and tail tip, with or without tan. However, he may be any bicolor, tricolor, merle, or solid color except white.The hardworking Border Collie isn't prissy, and he doesn't need excessive grooming to keep him looking good. His weather-resistant double coat needs weekly brushing to keep coat oils well distributed, and to prevent matting in the rough variety. More frequent brushing during shedding season is a good idea to minimize hair shed around the house (he sheds seasonally). Bathe only as needed — about every four months or when he's really dirty or smells terrible.Brush your Border Collie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once a month if needed, and check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Border Collie is a good family dog, as long as he is raised properly and receives training when he's young. He gets along with children and other pets, though his instinct to herd will cause him to nip, chase, and bark at kids (especially very young children) and animals if his herding instincts aren't otherwise directed.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.","Border Collies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Border Collies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Border Collie rescue.Border Collie Society of America","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Border Collie.Border Collie Society of America"

When left to their own devices, they can be noisy and destructive.These escape artists will find the way out of a fenced yard if given the time and opportunity. They've been known to climb over and dig under fences, and once they get out they have little street sense to keep them from dashing out in front of cars.Border Terriers have a high threshold for pain. If your dog's sick, the only sign may be a behavioral change, such as the dog becoming withdrawn or quiet.Border Terriers have a natural instinct to dig. Rather than fighting it, give your Border Terrier a place of his own to dig or put his digging drive to work with fun games.Border Terriers are active and bouncy. They love jumping up on people to greet them.The Border Terrier's coat needs weekly brushing and periodic stripping — removing the dead hair by hand or with a stripping tool — to maintain its trademark rough texture.Border Terriers love to chew. Some will grow out of chewing inappropriate items such as furniture and shoes, but others enjoy chewing throughout their lives. Giving them plenty of appropriate chew toys is the best way to avoid expensive replacements and unnecessary vet bills.Border Terriers aren't yappy, but they'll bark to alert you of anything unusual, and they can become nuisance barkers if they get bored.Border Terriers have a high prey drive and will chase, attack, and even kill neighborhood cats, squirrels or other small animals. They'll also go after small pets such as rabbits, mice, or gerbils. Because of their tendency to chase, make sure your yard is securely fenced, and don't let your Border off leash in an unfenced area.Border Terriers do well with other dogs and with family cats if the cat is raised with the Border Terrier or lived in the home before the Border Terrier.Border Terriers can make excellent companions for kids, but they can be rambunctious, especially when young, and can unintentionally hurt small children.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.",The Border Terrier is built to be big enough to keep up with hunters on horseback and small enough to squeeze into tight spaces. Males weigh 13 to 15.5 pounds; females 11.5 to 14 pounds. They stand 10 to 11 inches.,"Considering that they're terriers, Borders are pretty good-tempered, affectionate, obedient, and easily trained. They're highly intelligent and quickly learn the cues that signal you're going outside for a walk or to the office, when it's mealtime, and what you like and don't like them to chew.They're not so affectionate with other small animals. When it comes to going after prey (even if you don't keep them as hunting dogs), they're fearless and relentless.Like every dog, Border Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Border Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Border Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can get certain health conditions. Not all Border Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Border Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur: Hip Dysplasia is a condition in which the femur doesn't fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs who have hip dysplasia shouldn't be bred. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. Medication or surgery can help. Heart defects of various kinds can affect Border Terriers, the most common of which is pulmonic stenosis, a narrowing of the valve that separates the right chamber of the heart from the lungs. If your Border Terrier has a heart murmur, it may indicate that he has a heart condition that will need to be monitored and treated. Heart murmurs are caused by a disturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They're graded on their loudness, with one being very soft and six being very loud. If disease is evident, as diagnosed through x-rays and an echocardiogram, the dog may require medication, a special diet, and a reduction in the amount of exercise he gets. The best way to avoid heart defects is to check that the breeder has not used dogs with heart defects in her breeding program. Malocclusions, meaning the dog's jaws don't fit together correctly, are sometimes found in Border Terriers. There are three different types of incorrect bites. An overshot bite is when the upper jaw extends past the lower jaw. This causes difficulties in grasping; in more severe cases, the lower teeth can bite into the roof of the mouth, causing serious injuries. An undershot bite is when the lower jaw extends out past the upper jaw. Although it is standard in some breeds, it can cause difficulties in Border Terriers and may need to be corrected with surgery. The last type of incorrect bite is wry mouth, a twisting of the mouth caused when one side grows more quickly than the other. It causes difficulties with eating and grasping. In some cases, puppies grow out of these incorrect bites, but if the bite hasn't become normal by the time the puppy is 10 months old, it may need to be corrected surgically. If this is the case, wait until the puppy has finished growing. Corrective surgeries can include tooth extraction, crown height reductions, or the use of spacers. Dogs with incorrect bites, even if the bite is corrected surgically, should not be used for breeding. Seizures can be caused by a number of factors and can occur at any time. Signs of a seizure include sudden trembling or shaking, sudden urination, stiffness, staring, slight muscle spasms, or a loss of consciousness. Seizures aren't curable, but they can be successfully managed with medication. Patellar Luxation, also known as ""slipped stifles,"" is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair. Hypothyroidism occurs when the body can't maintain sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. Signs include weight gain, thinning coat, dry skin, slow heart rate, and sensitivity to cold. As hypothyroidism is a progressive condition, if you notice any of these signs, have your dog checked by your vet. Hypothyroidism is easily managed with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. Because this is a disease of middle age, asking the breeder about the thyroid status of your puppy's grandparents may give you a better idea of whether the problem occurs in the breeder's lines. Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not removed. When the neutering takes place, a small incision is made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner.","Border Terriers are family dogs and should live indoors with their people, not tied out in the backyard — although they do enjoy having access to a yard. Just make sure the fence is high and secure — these dogs can be expert escape artists.They'll enjoy at least a half hour of exercise daily, such as a walk on leash, off-leash play in a fenced area, or a good game of fetch. Without enough exercise, Border Terriers are prone to weight gain and boredom. Boredom can lead to destructive behavior and lots of barking.Border Terriers can be a trainer's mixed blessing. On one hand, they're eager to please and intelligent. They quickly learn house rules and other important dog etiquette such as housetraining, walking on leash, and greeting people politely (although they may never give up the habit of jumping up).When it comes to more advanced training, the real challenges begin. Border Terriers were developed to be independent because, during foxhunts, they had to work at a distance from their handlers. This trait is still strong in the breed, and although they may listen to a command, they'll decide for themselves when to obey it.Even so, use a light touch; they're sensitive and respond poorly to harsh training techniques, which will break their spirit. To train your Border Terrier, look for a trainer who understands the terrier mentality and uses positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.Given a regular schedule and plenty of opportunities to go to the bathroom outside, Border Terriers are easy to housetrain. Crate training helps with housetraining and will keep your Border Terrier from chewing things while you're away. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don't keep your Border locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Border Terrier is with you.Leash training is another must. It's amazing how quickly a Border Terrier can run off in search of prey or adventure. This drive does not fade with age; if anything, it becomes stronger.","Recommended daily amount: 1 1/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Border Terrier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Border Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Border Terrier has a short, dense undercoat covered with a wiry topcoat. His skin is thick and loose — something that came in handy during his fox-hunting days, as it protects him from bites.The Border Terrier coat can be red, blue and tan, grizzle and tan, or wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). Some have a small patch of white on the chest.Weekly brushing and periodic stripping (every five to six months) of the rough terrier coat will keep your Border looking neat and tidy. Your grooming kit should include a fine comb, a natural bristle brush, and a stripping knife (unless you opt for having a professional groomer take care of stripping the coat).Stripping involves plucking the dead hair by hand or removing it with a stripping knife or other stripping tool. It's the kind of thing you can do while you and your Border are watching a 30-minute television show. Your Border's breeder can show you how to strip the coat, or you can find a professional groomer who knows how to do it — not all do. You'll find that by stripping the coat, you'll have less Border hair decorating your clothing, furniture, and flooring.For easier care, you can clipper the coat, but the texture and color will become softer and lighter and the coat won't be weather resistant.If you don't mind the scruffy look, you can just leave the coat as is, with no stripping or clipping, but the coat may shed more.Border Terriers do not need to be bathed often — only when they've gotten into something gross and it's really necessary. Their coat naturally repels dirt and, with weekly brushing and a wipe-down with a damp cloth when needed, it should stay fairly clean. When you do bathe him, use a shampoo made for the rough terrier coat to help maintain its texture.Brush your Border Terrier's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don't get caught in the carpet and tear, and don't scratch your legs when your Border Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Start grooming your Border when he's a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Border Terriers love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but they're a little rambunctious for households with children under the age of 6 years.As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your Border Terrier, and supervise all interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party.Border Terriers usually get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they're introduced to them in puppyhood. They do best with dogs of the opposite sex. They're likely to chase outdoor cats as well as squirrels and other wildlife, and they shouldn't be trusted alone with pet birds or small, furry pets such as rabbits, hamsters, and gerbils.","Border Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Border Terriers end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you're interested in adopting an adult Border Terriers who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.North American Border Terrier Welfare","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Border Terrier.Border Terrier Club of America, Inc."

Although, as is always the case with newer dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 30 to 60 pounds and range in height from twelve to 22 inches.","When people describe their Bordoodles, they usually say that they're both highly sociable and extremely intelligent dogs. This is true. The mixed breed usually gets along great with families and will love to become a part of daily activities and routines.They're happy to chill out and snuggle, but also happy to join in play sessions with the kids. The breed's intelligence means that they also take well to training and will enjoy being mentally stimulated, especially if given fetch and herding-style tasks to undertake.Just be warned that this same intelligence can sometimes manifest itself in destructive behavior if the dog is left alone or not properly trained. So make sure to let the Bordoodle become a central part of your family and enjoy a great dog!Also be aware that the Bordoodle will quickly become protective towards the family that adopts them. While the mixed breed might not look like a classic guard dog, they will prove wary of strangers. This is a dog who's loyal to the people who show them love.","Bordoodles are generally considered to be healthy dogs; although, the mixed breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Border Collie and Poodle face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Bordoodles suffer from include:Progressive Retinal AtrophyEpilepsyHip Dysplasia","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Bordoodle's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early.

Consult your regular vet if you need advice on how best to carry out canine teeth cleanings. Also, check the mixed breed's paw pads and nails every week or so for any signs of damage, and trim the dog's nails every fortnight. Make sure to check their ears for debris or pests and clean them as recommended by your vet.","An ideal Bordoodle diet should be formulated for a medium breed with medium energy.Bordoodles need to stick to a healthy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Bordoodle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Bordoodle's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","You'll see the Bordoodle in a range of coat colors and patterns, usually incorporating a mix of black, white, gray and brown.The Bordoodle's coat is somewhere between medium and long in terms of length, and described as soft to the touch and wavy.

Borzoi,4,5,3,5,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,4,5,1,4,4,2,5,4,3,4,3,5,2,4,2,2,2,3,Hound Dogs,"2 feet, 2 inches to 2 feet, 8 inches tall at the shoulder",55 to 105 pounds,10 to 12 years,"Borzoi are sighthounds and will chase anything that moves. They should never be allowed to run loose unless in a secure area.Borzoi can be sensitive to drugs, especially anesthetics, due to their lack of body fat. Make sure your vet is aware of this. The drug Ropum (Xylazine) should never be used for a Borzoi. Also, avoid exercising them on lawns that have been recently treated with fertilizer, insecticides, herbicides, or other chemicals.Borzoi can be fussy eaters.Borzoi can be prone to bloat. Feed frequent small meals and prevent heavy exercise after eating.Borzoi can be nervous around children and should be introduced to them at a young age if they will be in frequent contact with them.Borzoi bark infrequently and do not have strong guarding instincts. They make poor watchdogs as they cannot be relied upon to raise the alarm when an intruder is sighted.They can live successfully with cats and small animals if introduced to them at an early age. Some Borzoi only follow the ""no chase"" rule indoors and cannot resist the instinct to chase a running cat if outdoors.The Borzoi is not a common breed, so it may take some searching to find a breeder who has puppies. Be patient.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand at least 28 inches at the shoulder and weigh 75 to 105 pounds. Females are at least 26 inches and weigh 55 to 85 pounds.,"The gentle-spirited Borzoi personality ranges from serious and stately to clownish. As a companion, the Borzoi is quiet, sensible, and intelligent. He prefers not to be left alone for long periods. His reaction to strangers ranges from aloof to friendly. In general, he's trusting of people and not shy. The Borzoi's easygoing nature doesn't necessarily mean he's easy to train, however. He's an independent thinker and can be stubborn. Last but not least, it's important to the Borzoi to know that he's loved, cared for, and will never be put in harm's way.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Borzoi need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Borzoi puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Borzoi are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Borzoi will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Borzoi, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as gastric torsion or bloat: This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.","Borzoi are housedogs, and they like their comforts. Expect to share the furniture with them or to provide them with cozy beds throughout the house where they can rest their bones. Some do best in a home with a yard, while others are fine simply being walked every day. If you are considering a Borzoi for an apartment or condo, however, take into account whether you'll need to carry the dog up and down the stairs if he's ever sick or injured and can't manage them on his own.Borzoi are not generally high-energy dogs, but activity levels vary among individuals. Some will exercise themselves if turned out into a yard while others are lazy and must be taken for a walk. Most Borzoi will be satisfied with a 20-minute walk daily and the occasional opportunity to run full out in a safely fenced area.Walks on leash or playtime in a safely fenced area are musts for this breed. The Borzoi is a sighthound, born to chase, and he'll go after anything that's moving, even if that means running in front of a truck. And you definitely won't be able to catch him once he takes off. An underground electronic fence will not contain a Borzoi. The desire to chase a moving object will always overcome the threat of a momentary shock.Like all hounds with a hunting heritage, Borzoi have minds of their own, which doesn't make training easy. People who don't understand the Borzoi mind may label them stubborn or dumb. They're stubborn, all right, but they're not dumb. They're just debating whether they want to do what you've asked and if so, what's in it for them. They quickly become bored with repetition, so keep training sessions short, fun, and interesting. Constant positive reinforcement is the key to successfully training a Borzoi. Training through intimidation will never work.Borzoi should not be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended, not only as an aid to housetraining, but also to protect your belongings and prevent your Borzoi puppy from getting into trouble when you're not around to supervise. When introduced properly, Borzoi become very fond of their crate and will often spend time in it on their own. Be sure to provide padding to protect their bony body. A good crate size for an adult Borzoi is 26 inches wide by 36 inches high by 48 inches long.Borzoi puppies are slow to mature, so don't expect puppy destructiveness to disappear any time soon. You can alleviate it by providing your Borzoi with plenty of exercise and companionship.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 8 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Borzoi are prone to gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat. The likelihood of this often-fatal condition can be decreased by feeding the Borzoi two or more small meals daily rather than a single large meal and avoiding exercise for a couple of hours before and after mealtime.Keep your Borzoi in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Borzoi, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Borzoi's long, silky coat, which can be any color or combination of colors, may be flat, wavy, or curly. Short, smooth hair covers the head, ears, and front of legs, and a profuse, curly frill adorns the neck. Thick feathering covers the tail and rear end. The hair's beautiful silky texture is resistant to dirt and mud, so it's easy to keep clean.Brush your Borzoi's coat weekly with a pin brush. Be sure to remove any mats from behind the ears or between the hind legs. Avoid using a wire slicker brush, which can ruin the coat. Borzoi are seasonally heavy shedders and may need brushing more frequently during that time. Bathe him as needed.Brush your Borzoi's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Borzoi enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Borzoi to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","The Borzoi can be too large for a household with small children, especially toddlers. They're giant dogs and can easily knock over a child by accident. Nor are they especially tolerant of toddlers poking and prodding them. They're best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Generally, Borzoi aren't aggressive toward other dogs, although in an uncontrolled situation their sighthound heritage may take over, especially if small dogs are running around. Some can be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex. With training, young Borzoi can learn not to chase or snap at smaller household pets, including cats. That training may only hold indoors, however. Cats outdoors — even your own cat — may be viewed as fair game.","Borzoi are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in need of adoption and or fostering.National Borzoi Rescue FoundationBorzoi Club of America","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Borzoi.Borzoi Club of America, Inc."

Because of their short coat, they can't stand extremely cold weather either. Even in temperate climates, the Boston Terrier should be kept indoors.Because Boston Terriers can have respiratory problems, avoid pulling on your dog's collar to get him to go what you want.Your Boston Terrier is prone to corneal ulcers because his eyes are so large and prominent. Be careful about his eyes when you're playing or taking him for a walk.Depending in part upon their diets, Boston Terriers can be prone to flatulence. If you can't tolerate a gassy dog, a Boston Terrier may not be for you.Because of their short noses, Boston Terriers often snort, drool, and snore (sometimes loudly).With their large heads and small pelvises, whelping isn't easy for Boston Terrier mothers. If you have thoughts about breeding, be sure you realize that in addition to the potential whelping problems that often require a caesarean section, Boston Terrier litters typically are not large (a litter consisting of only one puppy is not uncommon). You may have to wait for several months to get a good quality Boston Terrier puppy from a qualified breeder.While Boston Terriers typically are quiet, gentle dogs, not prone to yappiness or aggression, males can be scrappy around other dogs that they feel are invading their territory.Boston Terriers can be gluttonous about their food, so monitor their condition and make sure they don't become overweight.They can be stubborn, so persistence and consistency are definite pluses in training methods. They are sensitive to your tone of voice, and punishment can make them shut down, so training should be low-key and motivational. Crate-training is recommended while housetraining your Boston Terrier.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The Boston Terrier comes in three weight classes: under 15 pounds, 15 to 19 pounds, and 20 to 25 pounds. They typically stand 12 to 17 inches tall at the shoulder. No matter what they weigh, they should look sturdy, never skinny or spindly.","Known as the American Gentleman, the Boston Terrier is lively, smart, and affectionate with a gentle, even temperament. They can, however, be stubborn, so persistence and consistency are definite musts when training.Like every dog, the Boston Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Boston puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Boston Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Boston Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Boston Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website (offa.org).Cataracts: This is a clouded film over the eye lens. Boston Terriers are prone to developing both juvenile and adult cataracts. Juvenile cataracts develop between eight weeks of age and 12 months. While you can sometimes see juvenile cataracts, sometimes they can only be detected by a veterinary ophthalmologist using a CERF (Canine Eye Registration Foundation) test. When purchasing a Boston Terrier puppy, it's wise to ask the breeder if the puppy has been tested for juvenile cataracts.Cherry eye: Cherry eye is a prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid that is believed to be genetic in origin. It frequently occurs in dogs that are less than a year old. Some veterinarians reposition the gland surgically to its original site at the base of the third eyelid, while others remove the prolapsed gland altogether.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Heart murmurs: This is a soft or loud, harsh, regurgitant sound in the heart, especially over the mitral valve area where a defect causes a backflowing of blood into the left atrium. Because of this, the heart is not as efficient as it should be in providing blood to the body. Treatment often includes a low-sodium diet, restriction of exercise, diuretics, and medications.Deafness: Boston Terriers have a high incidence of deafness in one or both ears. Breeders should have puppies BAER tested to determine the status of the puppies' ears before they go to new homes. Note that Boston Terriers who are white over more than one-third of their heads and/or bodies tend to produce more deaf puppies.Brain tumors.Allergies: Boston Terriers can suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact allergies to food allergies. If your Boston is licking his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, he may have an allergy. Allergies can be diagnosed by your vet.Megaesophagus: This is a defect in the structure of the esophagus that causes a dog to regurgitate its undigested food. Regurgitation differs from vomiting in that there generally is no advance warning that it will occur, whereas with vomiting there is visible effort involved.Reverse sneezing: Reverse sneezing is a condition that can occur at any time in your Boston Terrier's life. Generally it occurs when your dog is overly excited, gulps his food too fast, or is affected by pollen in the air. Nasal secretions drop onto the soft palate, causing it to close over the windpipe. The dog makes a wheezing sound and may become alarmed. Talk soothingly to him and try to get him to relax to shorten the episode. Some people say that pinching the nostrils closed or holding the palm of your hand over his nose so the dog is forced to breathe through his mouth is the quickest way to stop the reverse sneezing. You may also try stroking his throat.","The Boston Terrier is a lively dog, but he doesn't have excessive exercise requirements. He's relatively inactive indoors and well suited for apartment dwellers or those who don't have a yard. He enjoys taking a walk with you and playing in a yard, but is definitely an indoor dog and should never be housed outside. Always keep in mind that Boston Terriers can't handle the heat or cold very well.Bostons are sensitive to your tone of voice, and punishment can make them shut down, so training should be low-key and motivational. Use positive techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play.","Recommended daily amount: 0.5 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Boston Terriers can be gluttonous about their food, so monitor their condition and make sure they don't become overweight. They can also be prone to flatulence, which may be related to their diet. Feed a high-quality food to reduce the likelihood of this problem.For more on feeding your Boston Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Perennially on the best-dressed list, the Boston Terrier wears a smooth, fine coat that comes in three colors: black, seal (looks black but has a reddish cast when seen in sunlight), or brindle, all with a white muzzle, face blaze, and chest, giving him the look of wearing a tuxedo.Boston Terriers don't come in solid colors such as black, gray, liver, or white. Be wary of breeders who try to sell you one of these dogs because of the ""rare"" color. Not sticking to the breed standard is a warning sign of a low-quality breeder.Boston Terriers are easy to groom. Brush them weekly with a firm bristle brush and bathe them with a dry, powder shampoo and a damp cloth, or give them an occasional bath when necessary. Because their eyes are so large and prominent, you should wash their faces every day and check their eyes for signs of redness or irritation.Although they do shed, it's minimal and should be easily controlled by regular brushing.Brush your Boston Terrier's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Boston Terrier to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Boston Terrier loves children and makes a good playmate for them. He's small enough that he won't knock them down but large enough that he's not easily injured. In general, he gets along well with other dogs and cats, especially if he's socialized to them at an early age.","Boston Terriers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Although he can be tidied up with a significant amount of elbow grease, his coat tends to collect dirt and debris, which in turn is deposited throughout your house.Not surprisingly, the Bouvier requires a lot of grooming — which can be time-intensive and/or expensive.Because of his assertive personality, this breed is not recommended for first-time dog owners.The Bouvier's size, herding instinct, and strong personality make leash training highly advisable.The Bouvier is happiest when he is with his family.",Males stand about 26 inches tall and females stand about 25 inches tall. Weight varies from 70 to 100 pounds.,"The Bouvier is known for being intelligent, protective, and strong willed. Not surprisingly, this herding dog likes to gather and protect his flock.He is deeply attached and devoted to his family, and happiest when he's a part of the action. Left alone for long periods of time, he's like to get bored — and resort to annoying behaviors like barking, chasing, and chewing — as well as become very unhappy.The Bouvier maintains a stiff upper lip, however, when it comes to showing affection for his family. He is not likely to jump for joy, Golden Retriever-style, when you return home, but is more likely to quietly show his devotion by curling up at your feet.The Bouvier has a strong personality: He needs an owner who can kindly and consistently show leadership, otherwise, he's likely to fill the void. This doesn't mean you should take a drill sergeant approach, but you must act the confident leader and consistently, albeit gently, enforce guidelines.Like every dog, the Bouvier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bouvier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Bouviers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Bouviers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Cancer: Symptoms that may indicate canine cancer include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.Glaucoma: Glaucoma is defined by an increased pressure in the eye, and can be found in two forms: primary, which is hereditary, and secondary, which is caused by decreased fluid in the eye due to other eye diseases. Symptoms include vision loss and pain, and treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type. Glaucoma is treated surgically or with eye drops.Entropion: This is the inward rolling of the eyelid, usually the lower one, and found in both eyes. It causes vision loss and irritation, and generally occurs before a dog turns a year old. Corrective surgery when the dog reaches adulthood is an effective treatment.Ectropion: Another eye condition, Ectropion is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritations and infection. If severe, surgery is required, but in mild cases, no treatment is necessary.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis: This is a heart problem is caused by an abnormally narrow connection between the left ventricle and the aorta. Fainting is the main symptom, eventually leading to heart failure and death. Your vet can detect it and prescribe the proper treatment.Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Bouviers. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.Addison's Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this is an extremely serious condition caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Symptoms include vomiting, a poor appetite, and lethargy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it's easy to misdiagnose until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe symptoms occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison's is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.Cushing's Disease: Also known as hyperadrenocorticism, this condition sets in when the body produces too much cortisol, sometimes due to an imbalance of the pituitary or adrenal gland. Common signs are excessive drinking and urination. If your Bouvier exhibits these two symptoms, take him to the veterinarian. Treatments include surgery and medication.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Bouviers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","The Bouvier des Flandres is happy to lie around the house and enjoy the luxuries of companionship. He isn't highly active, but he does need regular exercise. He lives comfortably in the city or country.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Bouvier puppy. Like other large breeds, the Bouvier grows very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making him susceptible to bone disorders. Don't let your Bouvier puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement or pull a cart until he's full grown and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, as is puppy agility play, with its one-inch jumps.Training should begin the day you bring your Bouvier puppy home. He is generally eager to please so training is fairly easy. But he can be stubborn, so owners must be consistent and firm to overcome his dominant personality.Another important step in training a Bouvier des Flandres puppy is socialization. Socialization is the process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other dogs and people.The Bouvier can be suspicious of strangers and very protective of his family — good qualities for a herding dog. Socialization will prevent him from becoming overly shy or protective. You can take the Bouvier puppy to many places that allow dogs, like pet supply and building supply stores to familiarize the dog to strangers and unfamiliar situations. Puppy training classes are highly recommended.Crate training is an important aid in housetraining, and it keeps the Bouvier safe and out of trouble when you are away from home. But he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Bouviers aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.Leash training is a must with the Bouvier. Although the breed is not known for wandering off, he is known for a strong herding drive. He may be unable to resist the temptation to chase people on bikes, cars, or other animals, which can endanger him and others.Tail docking is usually done when pups are very young. You can choose to crop his ears, or not. It requires surgery and several months of care after. If you like the look of cropped ears, factor in the care and expense, as well.","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Bouvier puppy. Like other large breeds, the Bouvier grows very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making him susceptible to bone disorders. Feed your puppy a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps him from growing too fast (22 to 24 percent protein and 12 to 15 percent fat).NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Bouvier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Bouvier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Bouvier des Flandres is blessed (or cursed, depending on you look at it) with a weather-resistant double coat. The outer coat is coarse and long; the undercoat is fine and dense. It appears in several colors, including fawn, black, salt and pepper, and brindle, and sometimes a white star is found on the chest.While he doesn't shed excessively, the handsome Bouvier does require quite a bit of grooming to keep his coat looking good. (It is important to begin this process when the Bouvier is a young puppy so he learns to accept grooming as a normal part of life.)His Dutch nickname, Vuilbaard, means ""dirty beard,"" and like all dogs with a fluffy coat, the Bouvier gets grubby fairly easily. Expect muddy paws, leaves or burrs, feces on the hindquarters, or a wet, dirty beard.The Bouvier's thick coat needs to be brushed several times a week, and it's a great idea to check the coat for burrs, ticks, or weeds every day. Bathe him every six to eight weeks, and trim his coat every few months. Many owners hire a professional to groom their Bouvier, though you still need to brush thoroughly on a very regular basis. If you are considering the Bouvier, consider the time and/or expense required for his upkeep.Brush your Bouvier's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems.

He may wish to herd his children with nudges and barks.To best teach him to get along with kids, he should be raised with them or, if he doesn't live with them, he should be exposed to children as he grows up.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Bouvier should be raised with other dogs and animals for the best chance at getting along with them when he grows up. If he is socialized and trained properly, he usually just ignores other animals in his household.

Not all Boxers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Here are a few conditions you and your vet should keep an eye out for:Cancer. Boxers are especially prone to the developing mast cell tumors, lymphoma, and brain tumors. White Boxers and Boxers with excessive white markings can be sunburned and may even develop skin cancer. If your Boxer is light-colored, apply sunscreen on their ears, nose, and coat when they go outdoors.Aortic stenosis/sub-aortic stenosis (AS/SAS). This is one of the most common heart defects found in Boxers. The aorta narrows below the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to supply blood to the body. This condition can cause fainting and even sudden death. It's an inherited condition, but its mode of transmission isn't known at this time. Typically, a veterinary cardiologist diagnoses this condition after a heart murmur has been detected. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.Boxer cardiomyopathy (BCM). Also called Boxer Arrythmic Cardiomyopathy (BAC), Familial Ventricular Arrhythmia (FVA) and Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC). BCM is an inherited condition. The dog' heart sometimes beats erratically (arrhythmia) due to an electrical conduction disorder. This can cause weakness, collapse, or sudden death. Because it is difficult to detect this condition, it can cause an unexpected death. Boxers who show signs of this condition should not be bred.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Treatment ranges from supplements that support joint function to total hip replacement.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog's fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life.Corneal Dystrophy: This refers to several diseases of the eye that are non-inflammatory and inherited. One or more layers of the cornea in both eyes are usually affected, although not necessarily symmetrically. In most breeds, corneal dystrophy appears as an opaque area in the center of the cornea or close to the periphery. This usually isn't painful unless corneal ulcers develop.Demodectic Mange: Also called Demodicosis. All dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother dog passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can't be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother passes mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause any problems. If your Boxer has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, they can develop demodectic mange. Demodectic mange, also called demodicosis, can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It's thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. Even so, you should take your dog to the vet because it can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link to its development. The third form of this disease, Demodectic Pododermititis, is confined to the paws and can cause deep infections.Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs like Boxers, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and type of food might be additional factors. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid themselves of the excess air in their stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. They also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it's recommended that dogs that develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.Allergies: Boxers are prone to allergies, both environmental allergies and food-related allergies. If you notice that your Boxer has itchy, scaly skin, have them checked out by your vet.Deafness: White Boxers are especially susceptible to deafness. About 20 percent of white Boxers are deaf, and white Boxers should not be bred because the genes that cause deafness in white Boxers can be inherited. Additionally, Boxers who carry the extreme white spotting gene can increase the incidence of deafness in the breed.","Boxers are housedogs. Their short noses and short coats make them unsuited to living outdoors, although they'll enjoy having a fenced yard to play in.Boxers love to play. To keep their muscles toned and satisfy their need for exercise, plan on playing with them or walking them at least twice a day for half an hour. Play fetch, take them for long walks, or get them involved in dog sports such as agility or flyball. Giving your Boxer plenty of daily exercise is the best way to ensure good behavior. A tired Boxer is a good Boxer.Training is essential for the Boxer. They're so big and strong that they can accidentally hurt people by knocking them over if they don't learn to control their actions. The Boxer's temperament plays a role in their trainability. They're happy and excitable, bouncy, and a bit of a mischief-maker. Getting them to take training seriously requires starting early and using firm, fair training methods and positive motivation in the form of praise, play, and food rewards. Be consistent. Your Boxer will notice any time you let them get away with something, and they'll push to see what else he can get away with. Before you head to training class, settle them down a little with an energetic walk or play session. They'll focus better once they've got their ya-yas out.Patience is the key to housetraining your Boxer. Some are housetrained by four months of age, but others aren't reliable until they're seven months to a year old. Take your Boxer out to potty on a regular schedule and praise them wildly when they do their business outdoors. Crate training is recommended.","An ideal Boxer diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy. Look for a high quality food for your pup so they can have the best chance for a long healthy life.Boxers may gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule. Usually two meals per day is recommended. Limit treats and don't leave food out all day. Follow your veterinarian's guidelines for a healthy diet.As with all dogs, the Boxer's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Boxer's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Boxers have a sleek, short coat with tight skin over their athletic bodies. They come in two colors: fawn or brindle, with or without white markings. Fawn ranges from light tan to mahogany. Brindle is a striking tiger-striped pattern of black stripes on a fawn background.White markings usually appear on the belly or feet and shouldn't cover more than one-third of the coat. When the white extends onto the neck or face, the color is called flashy fawn or flashy brindle. Boxers without any white are referred to as plain Boxers. On the face, the Boxer has a black mask, sometimes with a white stripe, or blaze, running up the muzzle between the eyes.Boxers don't carry the gene for a solid black coat color, so you won't ever see a black Boxer. In the United Kingdom, fawn boxers are typically rich in color and are called ""red.""White markings covering more than one third of the body is a disqualification in the show ring. That's because excessive white markings in Boxers make them more susceptible to health conditions such as skin cancer and deafness. Reputable breeders don't want to pass on those genes. In the past, breeders often euthanized white puppies at birth, but today most breeders place them in pet homes. While white Boxers can't be shown in conformation and shouldn't be bred, they can compete in obedience and agility, and of course, they still have the wonderful Boxer personality that makes them such great companions!The Boxer coat requires minimal grooming. Boxers are clean dogs and have been known to groom themselves like cats do. Boxers can shed quite a bit, but weekly brushing with a bristle brush or hard rubber grooming mitt will help keep hair under control. You can enhance the natural sheen of your Boxer's coat by rubbing it down every now and then with a chamois cloth. If you decide to use a shedding blade, be careful when using it around your Boxer's legs so you don't injure them. Bathe as needed.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Boxer's teeth several times a week to help remove tartar and bacteria. Daily is best if you want to prevent periodontal disease.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly-trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Boxer enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Boxer to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. Handle their paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside their mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Boxers love kids and are great playmates for active older children. They can be too rambunctious for toddlers, however, and can accidentally knock them down in play.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Boxers can get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they're raised with them.","Boxers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Boxers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents —  usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like any dog, the Briard can become timid if he is not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences —  when he is young. Primary socialization should be with people outside the household. Socialization helps ensure that your Briard puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Briards are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Briards will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Briards, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB): CNSB affects dogs in varying degrees. It can be as slight as difficulty moving in poor light to total blindness in a dim light; it can also mean complete blindness in any light. Research is underway for genetic testing.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.Cancer: Symptoms of canine cancer include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Briards. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.","The Briard can adapt to city or country life. He is a fairly calm breed when inside, but he does need 30 to 60 minutes of exercise daily. Without enough activity, the Briard can become bored, paving the way for annoying or destructive behaviors like barking, digging, chasing, and chewing. Dog sports, especially herding trials, are a good outlet for his energy and hone his natural herding ability.The Briard puppy must learn who the pack leader is or he'll try to assume the position; therefore, training should start as soon as the Briard puppy comes home. This doesn't mean he should know advanced commands by 9 weeks of age, but he should be learning proper manners and rules of the house right away.Crate training can be an important aid — it helps with housetraining and keeps your pup safe when you're away — but remember that he should be with the family (not in his crate) when you are at home.Because the Briard is naturally suspicious of people outside his ""flock,"" it is important to encourage your Briard puppy to be friendly with strangers. If a Briard is not properly socialized and trained, it can lead to aggression toward people or animals he considers a threat.","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Briard in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Briard, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Although considered a low- to non-shedding breed, the Briard has an outer coat and undercoat. The outer coat is slightly wavy with a coarse texture, about six inches long, while the undercoat is soft and fine. You'll see it in a variety of colors, or combination of colors, including black and shades of gray and tawny.Do you have several hours a week you can devote to grooming your Briard? If not, consider another breed. His fabulous coat requires quite a bit of brushing, combing, and fussing to keep it looking good. A thorough brushing every day is recommended, plus a bath every six to eight weeks. Like all dogs with fluffy coats, the Briard can get dirty easily, so you're in for muddy paws, leaves or burrs tracked into the house, feces on the hindquarters, or a wet and dirty beard.If the idea of keeping up with the Briard coat is overwhelming, consider hiring a professional groomer to help. You won't get out of regular brushings between groomings, but bathing and drying the coat is much easier in a salon equipped with waist-high tubs and high velocity dryers. It's especially easy when you're paying someone else to do it!Brush your Briard's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. The Briard usually has rear dewclaws so don't forget to trim these, too.Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Briard to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","A loving and playful companion, the Briard makes an excellent family dog. He is protective of the children in his family, and has been known to ""defend"" them when parents discipline.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.If the Briard is raised with other dogs and pets, and learns they are members of his pack, he gets along fairly well. However, his prey drive is strong, so training is necessary for him to learn not to chase the family cat or quarrel with your Beagle. Supervision is a good idea, as animals outside his immediate family are likely to trigger his instinct to give chase. Keep him on a leash when you are in public.","Briards are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Briards in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

As befits a pointing breed, they are curious and independent, but respond well to their people and want to please them. They can be singleminded when it comes to birds, but when they're not focused on their feathered prey, they enjoy spending time with their people, especially if they're doing something active. Brittanys are not just energetic, they're smart, so they needs loads of exercise and mental stimulation each day.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. In mild cases, with proper diet and exercise the animal can lead a full and active life. In more severe cases, surgical correction may be required. Your veterinarian can x-ray your dog's hips for evaluation.Epilepsy: This disorder causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. While epilepsy can't be cured, it often can be controlled with medication. If your Brittany has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.Hypothyroidism: This condition is caused by an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.","Brittanys are active, indoors and out. They do best if they have a large yard or, better yet, some acreage where they can run off some of their excess energy. They're not best suited to apartment life or city living unless you truly have the time and dedication to provide them with the amount and type of exercise they need. This breed is resistant to cold and damp conditions when hunting, but should live indoors with the people they love. Like any dog, they should be confined to a safely fenced yard when they aren't being supervised.Limit exercise to no more than half an hour at a time in puppies younger than two years of age. Their joints aren't yet fully formed, and neither is their muscle coordination and ability to focus. Take a break from training, play, or other activity any time your Brittany pup seems tired or unenthusiastic.Brittanys love to run in wide-open spaces. It's essential to teach them to come when called. Train them with firmness and consistency, but never be harsh. Often, a sharp word is more than enough to stop any misbehavior.Like any dog, Brittanys can be destructive as puppies. They can also be destructive as adults if their needs for mental and physical challenges aren't met. Keep them occupied with exercise and training, and crate puppies to prevent them from getting into trouble if you're not around to supervise.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

They have dense, flat, or wavy hair that's never curly, wiry, or silky. You'll see a little feathering on the ears and legs, but not so much that the Brittany would have trouble making his way through dense brush and undergrowth. You might notice that your Brittany's skin is fairly loose. Loose skin sort of rolls when it comes in contact with burrs and thorns, protecting the dog from puncture wounds.Most commonly, Brittanys are orange and white or liver and white. Sometimes their coats have a roan pattern, which is a fine mixture of colored and white hairs; for instance, orange roan. Some ticking — small isolated areas of black hairs on a white background — is desirable. Occasionally you'll see a tri-color Brittany, a liver and white dog with orange markings on the eyebrows, muzzle, cheeks, inside the ears, beneath the tail, and orange freckles on the lower part of the legs.Brittanys are easy to groom. Keep their coats in good condition with weekly brushing, and a bath or dry shampoo when necessary. They don't shed a great deal. Check the ears weekly for signs of infection such as redness or tenderness, as well as for foreign objects, especially if your Brittany has been out in rough or brushy terrain.Brush your Brittany's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long.

Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed-in, if possible.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog’s nails before they get too long—usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Broholmer's care will be maintaining oral health. Brush their teeth daily as it can be an expensive issue to deal with if their oral hygiene worsens. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Broholmer diet should be formulated for a large breed with medium energy. They have a tendency to gain weight when they're overfed due to their large size, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their number of treats as well.As with all dogs, the Broholmer's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years.

It's best to measure out their food and give them regular meals, instead of leaving out food for them all the time.Griffons can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain — stay patient, consistent, and definitely use a crate.They'll bark enthusiastically at every sound, making them good watchdogs but sometimes noisy housemates. Teaching your dog the ""quiet"" command is recommended.Griffons are sensitive dogs and when treated roughly, they may become fear biters — dogs who bite out of fear, rather than aggression.It's difficult to breed Griffons. They often need Caesarean sections, the litters are typically small, and puppy mortality is high.Griffons are not backyard dogs. Like other dogs with short noses, they're vulnerable to heat stroke, and their short hair makes them vulnerable to the cold as well. They need to live inside with the family.The demand for Griffon puppies surged after a Griffon dog was featured in the movie As Good As It Gets.

X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Veterinary care includes giving your Griffon supplements and medicines to help prevent or lessen the pain of arthritis and, in severe cases, surgery.Patella Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Eye Problems: The Brussels Griffon's prominent eyes are prone to being scratched and becoming irritated. Be sure to check with your vet if your dog's eyes are red or he is rubbing them excessively.Skin Allergies: Brussels Griffons can be prone to allergies. If yours is itching or licking at his paws excessively, have him checked by your vet.","Without a doubt, Griffons are housedogs. But so long as they're inside with the family, their small size makes them suited to any household, from city highrises to country estates. In either place they can impress you with their inborn rat-hunting skill.They have a lot of energy and need regular exercise to stay in shape, but they'll do okay without a yard so long as they get walks or some other exercise every day. Because they're short-nosed dogs, they can't cool the air they breathe in, and can overheat on hot, humid days. Heat stroke is dangerous, so keep your Griffon someplace cool on a hot day. If you do take him out in the sun, watch for the signs of heat exhaustion — deep, rapid panting and sluggishness. More serious signs include vomiting or diarrhea and seizures. Don't let him play hard on a hot day, and be sure he has access to plenty of fresh, cool water.His intelligence and athletic ability make the Griffon a contender in dog sports such as agility, obedience, and even tracking, as long as you persuade him that it's worthwhile. Training must be fun, and positive reinforcement — rewarding your dog for getting it right, rather than punishing him for mistakes — is the only way to get cooperation from a Griffon. You can't force a Griffon to do anything, but you can make him believe it's his idea.Like so many small breeds, Brussels Griffons can be hard to housetrain. Use crate training and be consistent and persistent, and your dog may eventually be reliable in the house. Or not.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Griffon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Griffon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Rough-coated Brussels Griffons have a wiry, dense coat with no silky hair anywhere on their bodies. The hair on the head is slightly longer around the eyes, cheeks, and chin. Although it's wiry, the rough coat should never appear untidy.Smooth-coated Brussels Griffons have a straight, short, glossy coat that lies close to the body, with no trace of wiry hair.Brussels Griffons come in four colors:Red (a reddish brown color with perhaps a little black at the whiskers and chin)Belge (black and reddish brown mixed, usually with black mask and whiskers)Black and Tan (black with uniform reddish brown markings under the chin, on the legs, above each eye, around the edges of the ears, and around the vent — the rear end to you and me)BlackA mature Brussels Griffon may sport a gray muzzle, but otherwise you won't see any white hairs on him.To keep their coats looking neat, rough-coated Griffons must be brushed weekly with a natural bristle brush or hound glove to remove dead hair and then combed with a medium-tooth metal comb. Twice a year they need specialized grooming. The coat must t be ""hand stripped,"" which involves gently plucking loose hairs out by hand to allow new coat growth. Your BG's breeder can show you how to strip the coat, or you can find a professional groomer who knows how to do it — not all do.The benefits? Stripping maintains the coat's hard, wiry texture and reduces scratching and shedding. And this type of coat is somewhat more friendly to people with allergies. You can keep your BG in a schnauzer clip if you don't want to deal with the time or expense involved in stripping the coat, but if you have allergies it may be worth your while to have it done or learn to do it yourself. Clipping the coat makes it feel softer, and the dog will shed more than he does with his wiry coat.Smooth-coated Griffons, on the other hand, need very little grooming other than weekly brushing and an occasional bath when they start to smell doggy. If your Griffon likes to play outdoors and then nap on your sofa or bed, you may want to bathe him weekly. As long as you use a shampoo made for dogs and rinse thoroughly, this shouldn't dry out his skin or hair.Whether smooth-coated or rough, the Griffon sheds little hair.Brush your Griffon's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Griffon enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Griffon to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Griffons don't enjoy hitting, unwanted hugs, being chased, or being forced to sit in someone's lap. If they're cornered or can't escape someone's grasp, they'll growl or snap. For these reasons, they're not a good match for homes with young children, who often don't understand that a cute little Griffon might not want their ""love and kisses.""It's fine to let your Griffon be around young kids — in fact, it's important to get him used to children, especially during puppyhood, when his temperament is still taking shape. But always supervise your Griffon when children are around, and never let young kids pick him up; instead, make the child sit on the floor with the dog in his lap. Pay attention to the dog's body language, and put him safely in his crate if he looks unhappy or uncomfortable with the child's attention.Griffons usually get along well with other pets, but like most small breeds they're completely unaware of their size and will take on dogs much bigger than themselves. Be prepared to protect them from themselves.","Brussels Griffons are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Griffons in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Griffon rescue.National Brussels Griffon Rescue, Inc.","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Brussels Griffon.American Brussels Griffon Association"

They don't do well when left alone for long periods and will wreak destruction when bored.Bull Terriers aren't suited for cold, damp climates. Keep your Bull Terrier warm with a coat or sweater in winter.These aren't high maintenance dogs, grooming-wise. A weekly brushing and occasional wipe-down with a damp cloth is usually all it takes to keeps them clean, although they must be brushed more frequently during twice-yearly shedding periods.The Bull Terrier needs 30 to 60 minutes of exercise, play, and mental stimulation daily.Ownership of Bull Terriers is restricted or banned in some cities, states, and provinces. Research your local dog laws before you get one; banned dogs may be seized and euthanized.The Bull Terrier is strong-willed and can be difficult to train. He's not recommended for timid or first-time dog owners.Without early socialization and training, Bull Terriers can be aggressive toward other dogs, animals, and people he doesn't know.Bull Terriers are too rough and rambunctious for homes with young children, but they're tireless playmates for active older kids who've been taught how to interact with dogs.Never buy a Bull Terrier from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.","Bull Terriers come in a wide range of sizes, ranging from 35 pounds to 75 pounds. Generally, males weigh 55 to 65 pounds and females 45 to 55 pounds. They stand about 21 to 22 inches at the shoulder.The Miniature Bull Terrier stands 10 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder, and weighs about 25 to 33 pounds.","Never one to take a backseat to anyone or anything, the Bull Terrier is a friendly, feisty extrovert who's always ready for a good time, and always happy to see you. A Bull Terrier who's shy and backs away from people is absolutely not normal.Bull Terriers and Mini Bull Terriers are described as courageous and full of fire. These are good traits, but they can veer into the disagreeable category if the Bull Terrier is allowed to become possessive or jealous. Without early training and socialization — exposure to dogs and other animals — they can be potentially aggressive toward other animals.With people, though, they have a sweet disposition. On the downside, they can be chewers, barkers, and tail chasers, and are often difficult to housetrain.","Bull terriers are generally healthy, but like any breed, they can have health issues. Reputable breeders provide health certifications for a puppy's parents.In Bull Terriers, you should expect to see the results of BAER hearing tests for white Bull Terriers, health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for the heart and thyroid, and UP:UC ratios for kidney function.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.The following problems may occur in the breed: Hereditary Nephritis is a severe form of kidney disease found in Bull Terriers, often at an early age. It's caused by small and undeveloped kidneys or a malfunction of the kidney's filters, resulting in high levels of protein in the urine. Bull Terriers with this disease usually die before they're three years old, although some live to be 6 or 8 years old before succumbing to kidney failure. A urine protein/urine creatinine (UP:UC) test is recommended annually, starting when dogs are 18 months old. Bull Terriers with an abnormal UP:UC ratio, meaning there's too much protein in the urine, should not be bred. Bull Terriers can also suffer from renal dysplasia, a congenital disease (meaning the dog is born with it) in which the kidneys don't mature properly, hindering their ability to perform properly. Deafness in one or both ears is common in white dogs, and some colored Bull Terriers can be deaf in one ear. All Bull Terrier puppies should undergo BAER (brainstem auditory evoked response) testing to ensure that their hearing is normal. A veterinarian or a Bull Terrier club can help you find the nearest BAER testing facility. Bull Terriers who are deaf in one ear can lead relatively normal lives, but puppies that are deaf in both ears require special training techniques and handling. Heart Disease caused by defects in heart structure and function is occasionally found in Bull Terriers. Some cases are more serious than others and usually are indicated by the presence of a heart murmur. In some cases, a cardiac ultrasound (echocardiogram) may be necessary to diagnose the problem. Some Bull Terriers outgrow their murmurs, some live with them for years with no problem, and others develop heart failure. Depending on the condition and the stage at which it's diagnosed, treatment may range from medication to surgery. Skin Problems can affect Bull Terriers, especially white ones, who have sensitive skin that can be prone to rashes, sores and irritations. They may also be prone to contact or inhalant allergies, caused by a reaction to substances such as detergents or other chemicals or airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Check your Bull Terrier's skin regularly and treat any rashes quickly. Provide soft, clean bedding in crates and other sleeping areas to prevent sores. Sometimes a change to a diet with few or no chemical additives can help. Other Bull Terriers need long-term treatment with antibiotics or steroids to keep skin problems under control. Spinning is an obsessive form of tail-chasing that usually begins at approximately six months of age. It can continue for hours and leave the dog with no interest in food or water. Spinning may be a type of seizure and is sometimes successfully treated with medications such as phenobarbitol, anafranil or Prozac. Treatment is often more successful in females than males. Bull Terriers can also develop a milder form of tail chasing that's easily dealt with by eliminating the dog's boredom. Lens luxation is when the lens of the eye is displaced when the ligament holding it in place deteriorates. It's sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed.","The Bull Terrier needs someone at home during the day. Leaving a Bull Terrier to entertain himself is about as smart as leaving a creative and intelligent child unsupervised in a room full of explosives. For one thing, they'll eat just about anything, and many die from gastrointestinal blockages that aren't discovered until it's too late. Rawhide toys can be especially problematic. Bull Terrier-proof your home!A Bull Terrier needs half an hour to an hour of physical and mental exercise daily. He'll enjoy going for walks, chasing a ball, or testing his wits against an interactive toy. He's also capable of competing in agility and obedience trials. Be sure to always walk him on leash so he won't run after other animals or go off exploring on his own.Bull Terrier puppies are bouncy and into everything. High-impact exercise can damage growing bones, so until your puppy's full grown, at 12 to 18 months of age, beware of bone-jarring activities such as jumping on and off the furniture, playing Frisbee, or running on slick wood or tile floors. These can all stress or injure the still-developing joints and ligaments.Early and consistent training is essential. You must be able to provide leadership without resorting to physical force or harsh words. A Bull Terrier isn't the easiest breed to train, and you'll be most successful if you appeal to his love of play with positive reinforcement techniques while still remaining firm and consistent in what you expect.Bull Terriers can be difficult to housetrain. Follow the housetraining program closely; the crate method is best. A crate will also prevent your Bull Terrier from destroying your belongings or otherwise getting into trouble.Bull Terriers are suspicious of strangers and can be aggressive toward other animals (especially dogs of the same sex) and people. Take him to puppy socialization classes as early as possible, as well as to dog-friendly public places so he can get used to many different situations, people, and dogs. He should also learn to welcome visitors to your home.","Recommended daily amount: 1 5/8 to 4 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Bull Terriers come in two color varieties: white and colored. White Bull Terriers are solid white, with or without colored markings on the head but nowhere else on the body. Colored Bull Terriers are any color other than white or any color with white markings.Bull Terriers are easy to groom; they need only weekly brushing with a rubber mitt or curry brush. The exception is during their twice yearly shedding season, when daily brushing will be necessary to keep all the hair under control. Unless they've rolled in something stinky, Bull Terriers don't need frequent bathing and can be washed with a dry shampoo or dusted off with a damp cloth.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Bull Terrier's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don't get caught in the carpet and tear. If the feet need to be tidied up with trimming, the best time to do it is when you are clipping the nails.Check the ears weekly to make sure there's no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean them as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog's breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don't stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger.Begin getting your Bull Terrier used to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Bull Terriers and Miniature Bull Terriers are active dogs who can play rough, so they're not recommended for homes with young children. They're great playmates with boundless energy for active older children who understand how to interact with dogs.Bull Terriers can, however, be aggressive toward kids they don't know, especially if there's a lot of shouting or wrestling going on. They may feel it's their duty to protect ""their"" children from their friends. Always supervise play; as with any dog, never leave a dog alone with a child, and teach children how to approach and touch dogs.With the children in their own family, they're highly tolerant, but they don't like being teased. Don't permit your children to play tug-of-war with the dog.Bull Terriers, especially unneutered males, can be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex, but opposite genders usually get along well.

Female Bullboxer Pits can often be a little smaller than their male counterparts.","Bullboxer Pits have often been used as farm or guard dogs, due mostly to their loyal nature and powerful strength. These dogs can be especially devoted to their families, and often become very protective of any children in the household.While the Bullboxer Pit's loyalty is not in doubt, it does take an exceptionally responsible human owner to bring the best out of the breed--socialization needs to start early and should be an ongoing part of the dog's life.Thanks to the Bullboxer Pit's parent breeds, this is a very active dog. Committing to a large amount of exercise is key to maintaining the canine's powerful figure and muscular appearance. Very upbeat walks--or even jogs--are required, so the owner must also be able to maintain a healthy and regular exercise routine. Around two hours of exercise per day is required--adding agility training or even swimming to the daily sessions can help vary things up.Apartment dwellers may find that many buildings do not permit Bullboxer Pits to live with them. These dogs aren't particularly well suited to apartment life, anyway, though they can live in a small space if owners keep up with their high exercise needs.","As you'd expect from such an athletic breed, Bullboxer Pits are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although they can suffer from some common health issues.

In tandem with a sensible diet, it is imperative that Bullboxer Pits are put on a very active exercise regime. Aim for a couple of hours of exercise every day, and supplement very brisk walks with frisbee and swimming sessions, along with properly monitored agility training.The Bullboxer Pit's paw pads also require attentive maintenance to stop them from cracking and drying out.

Your mature Bulldog may not be very enthusiastic about going to a walk, but it's important that he is exercised every day to keep him fit. Bulldogs can't tolerate heat and humidity. When your Bulldog is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating and take him inside immediately if he starts to show distress. Some people put kiddy play pools filled with water in a shaded spot for their Bulldogs to lie in when the weather is warm and everyone is outside. They definitely are housedogs and should not live outdoors all of the time.Bulldogs are sensitive to cold weather.Bulldogs wheeze, snort, and snore. They also are prone to sleep apnea.Bulldogs are well-known for having flatulence. If this problem seems excessive with yours, talk to your vet.Bulldogs' short noses make them prone to a number of respiratory ailments.Bulldogs can have pinched nostrils that make it difficult for them to breathe and may require surgery to correct.Bulldogs are greedy eaters and will overeat if given the chance. Since they gain weight easily, they can quickly become obese if you don't monitor their food intake.Because of the size of their heads and fronts, Bulldogs have difficulty giving birth. Most require caesareans to deliver their puppies. It isn't advised for inexperienced breeders to try to breed them.As a short-nosed breed, Bulldogs are sensitive to anesthesia. Be sure to talk with your vet about this before any surgeries are done.To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.",Mature male Bulldogs weigh about 50 pounds; mature females about 40 pounds. Show dogs may be about 10 pounds heavier. They stand 12 to 15 inches at the shoulder.,"Sociable and sweet, but with a reputation for courage that makes him an excellent watchdog, the Bulldog is a lover, not a fighter. He's dignified rather than lively and has a kind although occasionally stubborn nature. The Bulldog is friendly and easygoing; he gets along with everyone. He can be a slow learner, but once he knows something, he's got it for good. Bulldogs don't tend to be barkers. Usually their appearance alone is enough to frighten off intruders.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents-usually the mother is the one who's available-to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Bulldogs need early socialization-exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences-when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Bulldog puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Like all breeds, Bulldogs are prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Bulldogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them so you can be informed when you interview breeders and can know what to look for throughout your Bulldog's life.Buying from a responsible breeder will help ensure that you get the healthiest Bulldog possible. A puppy from a reputable Bulldog breeder will be vaccinated and dewormed before you take him home. Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least 2 years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed.Both parents should have health clearances, documentation that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Bulldogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbow, and knees, and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF), certifying that the eyes are normal.Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That's because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it's often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.Overall, Bulldogs can have a lot of health problems. They are wonderful dogs, but be sure you're willing to monitor their health closely and can afford any medical treatment they may need. The following conditions may affect Bulldogs:Cherry Eye: This is a condition in which the gland under the third eyelid protrudes and looks rather like a cherry in the corner of the eye. Your vet may need to remove the gland.Dry Eye: This condition is caused when natural tear production is inadequate. Signs include a dry appearance or blue haze to the eye. Your vet can perform a test to determine if your Bulldog has dry eye and prescribe medication you can administer to relieve the pain of this condition.Entropion: This is a condition in which the eyelashes turn inward and rub against the eye, causing irritation. It may require surgery to correct.Inverted Or Reverse Sneezing: This isn't really a health problem but generally occurs when nasal fluids drip down on the Bulldog's soft palate, causing it to close. It also can occur when your Bulldog gets something in his nose. It sounds a lot worse than it is. Try to calm your Bulldog by stroking his throat and this should pass quickly.Brachycephalic Syndrome: This disorder is found in dogs with short heads, narrowed nostrils, or elongated soft palates. Their airways are obstructed to varying degrees and can cause anything from noisy or labored breathing to total collapse of the airway. Dogs with brachycephalic syndrome commonly snuffle and snort. Treatment varies depending on the severity of the condition but includes oxygen therapy as well as surgery to widen nostrils or shorten palates.Head Shakes. This resembles a fit, but it affects only the head. It's seen as an involuntary shaking of the head from side-to-side or up-and-down. Sometimes, this is violent. This dog appears to be conscious and aware of what is happening. It may be linked to stress and low blood sugar. Breeders often suggest giving your dog some honey to bring the blood sugar level back up or distracting them to stop the shaking. If the shaking doesn't appear to be related to stress or over-excitement, you should take him to the vet as soon as possible to make sure he isn't in pain.Demodectic mange. Also called Demodicosis. All dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can't be passed to humans or even other dogs - only the mother can ""give"" these mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause any problems. If your Bulldog has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, he can develop demodectic mange. Demodectic mange can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck, and forelegs. It's thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. You should take your dog to the vet anyway because this can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. (Enlarged lymph nodes often are a sign that this will occur.)  Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over its body. Dogs that develop localized or generalized demodicosis should not be bred because the condition is considered to have a genetic component.Hip Dysplasia. This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Most Bulldogs appear to have hip dysplasia based on their hip x-rays, just because they tend to naturally have shallow hip joints, but it's unusual for them to have the associated problems with lameness unless they're allowed to become overweight or are exercised too much during their period of rapid growth. If your Bulldog is diagnosed with hip dysplasia, seek a second opinion and look into other treatment options, such as supplements, before agreeing to surgery.Tail Problems. Some Bulldogs have screw tails, inverted tails or other types of ""tight"" tails that can cause them to have some skin problems. You should keep your Bulldog's tail clean and dry to prevent infection.Patellar luxation. Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.","Bulldogs are inactive indoors and don't require a great deal of exercise (although they must be walked every day to keep them from gaining weight). They are indoor dogs and prefer a relaxed lifestyle. After about 15 minutes of play, they're ready for a nap. This low to moderate energy level makes the Bulldog suited to any type home, from an apartment to a house with a yard. You can take the Bulldog for a walk of a mile or two during the cool part of the day, but he'll be just as happy with a brief stroll up and down your street.Because of their pushed-in face, Bulldogs don't do well in extremely hot (or cold) weather. They breathe heavily when they're hot and don't dissipate heat well. They're especially susceptible to heatstroke. As little as half an hour outdoors in 85-degree temperatures can kill them. Provide him with an air-conditioned environment and plenty of fresh water. Bulldogs are also not swimmers. Their massive heads drag them straight down. If you have a pool, spa, or pond, protect your Bulldog from falling in.The Bulldog is unlikely to be an obedience-trial star, but once he learns something, he never forgets it. He learns best through fun training sessions that involve repetition and positive reinforcement through food rewards and praise.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.It's easy to overfeed a Bulldog, but obesity can stress his joints, so he shouldn't be allowed to get fat. Keep your adult Bulldog in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Bulldog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Your Bulldog's coat should be straight, short, fine textured, smooth and glossy. He has soft, loose skin, especially on the head, neck, and shoulders. His head is covered with heavy wrinkles and he has two loose folds at the throat (from the jaw to the chest) to form what's called a dewlap.Bulldogs come in a variety of colors: red brindle; all other brindles; solid white; solid red, fawn, or fallow (pale cream to light fawn, pale yellow, or yellow red; and piebald (large patches of two or more colors). Solid black isn't common and isn't much admired.Brush the Bulldog's smooth, fine, short-haired coat once a week with a firm bristle brush. Wipe his face with a damp cloth every day, taking care to clean inside the wrinkles. Be sure to dry the inside of the wrinkles completely after they're washed. Some people suggest wiping the wrinkles with baby wipes that have lanolin and aloe vera. If your Bulldog's skin is irritated inside of the wrinkles, ask your vet to recommend a soothing ointment. After you've cleaned the wrinkles, wash your Bulldog's nose and apply petroleum jelly to it to keep it soft and prevent it from becoming dry and flaky.The Bulldog is an average shedder. If you can take the time to brush him more than once a week, it will help reduce the amount of hair that gets on your clothes and furniture.Other grooming needs include nail care and dental hygiene. Trim your Bulldog's nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. The earlier you introduce your Bulldog to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is for both of you.Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he'll be used to it.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","His amiable temperament and bulk make the Bulldog an excellent companion for children, even young ones. A Bulldog will put up with a lot from a child, although he shouldn't have to, and he'll walk away if he gets tired of being tormented.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.With their pacific nature, Bulldogs also get along well with other pets, dogs and cats. They may be less sociable toward strange dogs, however.","Bulldogs are sometimes purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Bulldogs end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. Adopting an adult Bulldog has many benefits. Adult dogs are often already housetrained and have some obedience training, and they've already gone through the destructive puppy stage.The Bulldog Club of America Rescue Network","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Bulldog.Bulldog Club of America"

Smart and reliable, they can be an independent thinker, yet they want to please.They're a natural guardian of the home and family and will respond instantly if they're threatened. Bullmastiffs were bred to be silent watchdogs, so it's unusual for them to bark.As with every dog, Bullmastiffs need early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Bullmastiff puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking them to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help them polish their social skills.","Bullmastiffs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Bullmastiffs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old.Common health problems in this breed include cancer, hip and elbow dysplasia, torn anterior cruciate ligaments, bloat, subaortic stenosis, skin and coat problems, hypothyroidism, and entropion.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain.Hypothyroidism: Caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone, this disease may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog's fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Bullmastiff has entropion, you may notice them rubbing at their eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically, which is best done after the dog reaches maturity at one or two years of age.Subaortic Stenosis: This common heart defect occurs when the aorta narrows below the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to supply blood to the body. This condition can cause fainting and even sudden death. It's an inherited condition, but its mode of transmission isn't known at this time. Typically, a veterinary cardiologist diagnoses this condition after a heart murmur has been detected. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.Cystinuria: This genetic disorder is caused by an inability to reabsorb cystine, an amino acid, back into the kidney tubules. This results in the formation of kidney or bladder stones, which can cause life-threatening blockages of the urinary tract, especially in males. It's identified through an inexpensive urine nitroprusside test for cystine available through the University of Pennsylvania. Medication, diet, and surgery are all options that may help. Dogs with this inherited defect should not be bred.Gastric Dilatation Volvulus, Gastric Torsion, Bloat: This life-threatening condition can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Bullmastiffs, especially if they are fed only one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, or are allowed to exercise vigorously after eating. Raised feeding dishes and the type of food given may also be factors. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. They also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it's recommended that dogs who develop this condition be neutered or spayed.Ruptured Anterior Cruciate Ligament: This common knee injury tends to occur in large young dogs during play and older overweight dogs. A twisting of the dog's hind leg, which causes the anterior cruciate ligament to tear or rupture resulting in a sudden lameness in a hind leg. When the ligament is torn or ruptured, the tibia and femur can move against each other. This can lead to arthritis fairly quickly. Surgery is one form of treatment if the ligament is completely torn. If the ligament is only partially torn and other circumstances rule out surgery as an option, the rupture can be treated medically with special instruction on low-impact exercise and, if the dog is overweight, diet.Cancer: Dogs, like humans, can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancer, and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, the tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically. Cancers found commonly in Bullmastiffs include lymphosarcoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, and mast cell tumors.Panosteitis: This is an elusive ailment sometimes seen in young dogs. Its primary sign is sudden lameness, and puppies usually outgrow it by the age of two years with no long-term problems. The lameness can be slight or severe and can be managed with canine pain relievers. Panosteitis is often misdiagnosed as elbow dysplasia, hip dysplasia, patellar luxation, or even more serious disorders. If misdiagnosed, the vet may want to do surgery on your dog that isn't needed. If signs occur, ask for a second opinion from an orthopedic specialist before allowing surgery to be performed.Skin Problems: Bullmastiffs have sensitive skin that can be prone to rashes, sores, and irritations. They may also be prone to contact or inhalant allergies, caused by a reaction to substances such as detergents or other chemicals or airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Check your Bullmastiff's skin regularly and treat any rashes quickly. Provide soft, clean bedding in crates and other sleeping areas to prevent sores. Sometimes a change to a diet with few or no chemical additives can help. Other Bullmastiffs need long-term treatment with antibiotics or steroids to keep skin problems under control.","The Bullmastiff is a low-energy dog who can adapt well to most home environments, although their size makes them best suited to a house with a fenced yard.Besides keeping them from roaming and protecting them from traffic, a fence prevents the Bullmastiff from expanding their territory beyond their home and yard, which could cause them to try to prevent other people and dogs from entering the surrounding area.Their short muzzle makes the Bullmastiff prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Avoid exercise during the heat of the day, and keep them indoors during hot or humid weather. Be sure they always have access to shade and fresh water when they're outdoors.Start training your Bullmastiff puppy as soon as you bring them home, while they're still at a manageable size. Enroll in a puppy socialization class to get them used to being around other dogs and people. This is extremely important for the Bullmastiff, who can be aggressive toward other dogs and people they don't know if they aren't taught manners.In addition to puppy kindergarten and regular obedience class, take your Bullmastiff to parks, outdoor shopping malls, and other places where they can learn to meet people and become accustomed to new experiences, sights, and sounds.Although they want to please, the Bullmastiff thinks for themselves and needs a confident trainer. Use positive reinforcement techniques, never physical punishment, but be firm and consistent in what you ask of them. Avoid repetitive training, or your Bullmastiff will get bored and start doing their own thing.Think beyond puppyhood. If you don't want your Bullmastiff on the furniture when they weigh 130 pounds, don't let them on it when they only weigh 20 pounds. Once a habit is established, it will be difficult to break.Housetraining shouldn't be a problem as long as you make it a positive experience and provide your pup with a regular potty schedule and plenty of opportunities to go outside. Crate training is a wonderful tool for housetraining and keeping your young puppy from chewing things they shouldn't.The Bullmastiff needs a firm hand when training, but they also need love and patience. When they're trained, you'll find that they're a wonderful, caring, and loyal companion who will gladly risk their life to defend yours.","Recommended daily amount: 3 1/8 to 4 1/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on their size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of food you buy also makes a difference--the better the food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog, and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Bullmastiff in good shape by measuring their food and feeding them twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether they're overweight, give them the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at them. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on their back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, they need less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Bullmastiff, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Bullmastiff coat is short and dense, offering good protection from rain, snow, and cold.It comes in three colors: red, fawn or brindle (specks and streaks of light and dark markings) with a dark muzzle and ears. Occasionally, a Bullmastiff will have a small white mark on their chest.Bullmastiffs don't shed heavily, and their coats are easy to keep clean and shiny with a quick daily brushing using a rubber curry. Bathe only as needed.Check the ears weekly and clean as needed with a solution recommended by your veterinarian. If they smell bad or are filled with a waxy material resembling coffee grounds, the dog may have an infection or mite infestation, so take them to a veterinarian.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. If the nails get too long, the toes can become spread out, reducing the support provided by the foot and making it more likely that stickers and small stones will get stuck in the foot.Don't forget dental hygiene. Brush their teeth at least two or three times a week to prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease, daily for best results.Grooming provides you with an excellent opportunity to bond with your dog and to check their overall health. As you brush the coat or teeth, clean the ears and trim the nails, look for sores or other signs of irritation such as redness on the skin, mouth, feet, and ears. Eyes should be free of redness or discharge.Begin getting your Bullmastiff used to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. Handle their paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside their mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.","Bullmastiffs are patient with and protective of children, but because they're so large, they can accidentally knock over or step on a toddler. If you have children, take their age and size into consideration when deciding whether to get a Bullmastiff.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child to never approach any dog while they're sleeping or eating or try to take away the dog's food. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Bullmastiff may well be aggressive toward dogs they don't know. They do best with dogs of the opposite sex, especially if they've been raised with them.They can get along with cats if they're raised with them, although some Bullmastiffs can't resist the urge to chase them. A cat who stands up for themselves will fare better than one who runs away.","Bullmastiffs are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

This mixed breed loves to follow their owners around, and despite sometimes demonstrating a wariness towards strangers, they will be happy to take center stage at family get-togethers.Exercise is a must for a Bullmatian's daily routine. These dogs are always up for a walk, and if you're a jogger, feel free to bring your Bullmatian along for the run! Ideally, a fenced in garden or yard will allow your Bullmatian to frolic outside on their own, too. Mental stimulation is also vital, so make sure to provide a range of interactive toys, and rotate them regularly.While Bullmatians are super loyal dogs, they can be prone to bouts of stubbornness. This is why it's imperative that they are trained and socialized correctly from an early age--and you might need to exercise a high degree of patience at first. But once your Bullmatian learns to trust and respect you, the breed proves to be a devoted dog and companion.","Bullmatians are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although the breed can suffer from issues and ailments inherited from their parent breeds.Some of the more common health problems Bullmatians suffer from include:Entropion and eye issuesPatellar luxationDermatitisDeafness","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Bullmatian's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Just like any other dog, Bullmatians can become obese due to overeating, so it is important to monitor food servings. Because the Bullmatian is such an active dog, it's vital to keep up proper exercise routines. Try and aim for at least one and preferably two hours of physical exercise every day.If possible, brush your Bullmatian's teeth a few times a week, and as often as every day if your vet recommends so. The breed's nails will also need to be trimmed, while weekly ear wipe sessions should be undertaken to lessen the risk of infection. Remember, a clean Bullmatian is a healthy Bullmatian!","An ideal Bullmatian diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy.As with all dogs, the Bullmatian's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Bullmatian's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","As you'd expect from a dog with Dalmatian heritage, the Bullmatian has a spotted coat. Although, unlike Dalmatians, the spots will not always be black--colors like brown, orange, fawn, red, and brindle are frequently seen.This breed's coat is short-haired and straight. Bullmatians are relatively low maintenance when it comes to grooming, requiring coat brushings only about three times a week.In general, Bullmatians prefer a moderate climate.

These behaviors can be minimized with training, but they can't be eliminated. If you don't enjoy the typical terrier temperament, you should consider another breed.The Cairn is intelligent and curious. He also has a mind of his own. He will challenge your authority — good naturedly, of course — but you must be able to establish and maintain your role as pack leader, or he'll get the upper hand.The Cairn loves the attention of his family. Do not leave him alone for long periods of time or he may become destructive.The Cairn Terrier often thinks he's bigger than he actually is. Don't be surprised if he stands up for himself against large dogs or animals.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 10 inches tall and weigh 14 pounds. Females stand 9.5 inches tall and weigh 13 pounds.,"The Cairn Terrier is a wonderfully friendly dog. He's happy and cheerful, and he seems to truly enjoy meeting people. He's also all terrier: independent, tough, and alert. Like any dog of the breed, he places digging, barking, and chasing high on his list of fun activities. He'll chase any small animal, including the neighbor's cat, if given a chance. He's a good watchdog, too, and will announce any visitor.Though independent, the Cairn is devoted to his family and is happiest when he's part of his owners' daily lives. He likes to be in the house, playing with the kids, following you room to room, joining you at the front door when you greet a friend. He's also known for being sensitive. He doesn't like to be scolded and is upset when you're not happy with him.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Cairn needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Cairn puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Cairns are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Cairns will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Cairns, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Craniomandibular Osteopathy: This affects the skull bones of a growing puppy, causing them to become irregularly enlarged. Symptoms usually appear between four and eight months of age. The cause is unknown but believed to be hereditary. Often the puppy's jaw and glands will become swollen, and he won't be able to open his mouth. He'll drool, have a fluctuating fever that recurs every couple of weeks, and, in some cases, his chewing muscles may atrophy. Anti-inflammatories and pain relievers help the dog deal with what is a painful condition. The irregular bone growth slows and typically stops by the time the puppy becomes a year old. The lesions can regress, but a few dogs have permanent jaw problems and therefore have trouble eating. Occasional cases are severe enough to call for jaw surgery.Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both of the testicles to descend into the scrotum. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is two months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if not removed. Treatment is surgical neutering.Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy: Also known as Krabbe's disease, this is a degenerative disease of the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Affected puppies die at a very early age or are euthanized. There is now a test available that can identify carriers of this disease. Breeding dogs should be tested.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This affliction involves the hip joint. If your Cairn has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Ocular Melanosis/Secondary Glaucoma: Formerly called pigmentary glaucoma, this is a fairly recent development in the United States (since 1984). It is a painful inherited condition that occurs primarily in Cairns between seven and 12 years old. The condition generally affects both eyes. Watch both eyes for small spots or patches of very dark pigmentation within the sclera (white part of the eye). The pigment deposits accumulate and decrease ability of fluid to drain out of the anterior chamber. This leads to increased pressure, which is known as secondary glaucoma. If diagnosed early, the condition can be controlled with medication.Portosystemic Liver Shunt: This is a congenital abnormality in which blood vessels allow blood to bypass the liver. As a result, the blood is not cleansed by the liver as it should be. Surgery is usually the best option.","Caring for a Cairn Terrier isn't difficult. Because of his small size, he's a good dog for apartment dwellers, but he's also hardy enough to enjoy ranch life. He must have sufficient exercise and activity, however. A long daily walk or vigorous play for 20 to 30 minutes will help keep him healthy and alert.Despite the fact that he's a quick study, remember that the Cairn also has a stubborn streak. Regular obedience training (beginning with puppy classes) is essential to teach him good manners and respect for your authority. Don't be surprised if he challenges you — just keep training. Be positive, kind, and consistent.A ""quiet"" command should be one of your Cairn's basics. Don't let him off-leash in public places; he's likely to give in to any temptation to chase. And don't give him unsupervised free time in the yard. He'll dig, and he doesn't care whether he excavates a secluded area by the fence or your lovely new flower garden.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Cairn in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Cairn, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The scruffy-looking Cairn Terrier has a double coat: a wiry outer coat and soft undercoat. The coat comes in many colors, including red, brindle, black, sand, and gray.This coat is easy to groom. A thorough brushing once a week is sufficient, as is periodic bathing (every three months or so, or as needed). Frequent bathing isn't recommended because it softens the coarse terrier coat. While a soft coat isn't harmful to any dog, and is fine for a pet, it does detract from a show Cairn's physical appearance.Some trimming is necessary for the Cairn — mostly to tidy his look, not radically style his locks. If he's to be a show dog, his coat isn't trimmed with clippers (as is the Poodle's coat, for example), but shortened or shaped by stripping with a stripping knife. Stripping isn't really necessary for a family pet, however; a professional trim with clippers two to three times a year is fine (though be aware that this practice softens the breed's naturally coarse coat).Brush your Cairn's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Cairn to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Cairn Terrier loves kids and is highly tolerant of them. In fact, he enjoys the noise and commotion that goes along with children. As for other pets, a properly socialized and trained Cairn tends to get along with and respect those in the household. He's apt to chase any other animal that comes into his yard, however.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.","Cairns are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Cairns in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They will attempt to wrest ""pack"" leadership from a passive owner.They need extensive and continual socialization throughout their life to help them recognize what is a threat and what is not.Canaan Dogs can be dog-aggressive. Some cannot live with a dog of the same sex, and some extend the aggression to any dog that they meet.Canaans are aloof with strangers.Canaan Dogs bark when something is new or different in their territory. They can become nuisance barkers if they aren't taught when to stop or if they're frequently left alone for long periods.They do not make good guard dogs as their suspicion of new people and things can make them indiscriminate about who and what is a threat.Canaan Dogs require a securely fenced yard.They like to dig and can turn your nicely manicured lawn into a plot that resembles the surface of the moon.Their intelligence makes them highly trainable, but their independent nature and difficulty with motivation can make it questionable whether they will choose to listen to you. When it comes to training, they have a ""what's in it for me?"" attitude.They shed profusely twice a year and shed smaller amounts throughout the rest of the year.Canaan Dogs are a rare breed, with only about 1,600 in the world. If you want a Canaan Dog puppy, expect to spend time on a waiting list.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Male Canaan Dogs stand 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder and weigh 45 to 55 pounds; females are smaller at 19 to 23 inches and 35 to 45 pounds.,"The Canaan is described as alert, vigilant, devoted, and docile with his family. He's aloof toward strangers, although he should never be shy or aggressive, and highly territorial. His territoriality, which kicks in at about age 2, makes the Canaan a good alarm dog. He's sure to bark whenever anyone comes to the door, settling back down once he's certain you have the situation under control. That's assuming he views you as leader of the pack. If he doesn't, he may try to run things himself and make his own decisions about who's welcome and who's not. You must be willing and able to be a strong leader when you live with a Canaan.The breed requires extensive socialization — exposure to many different people, places, sights, sounds, and experiences — and not just for a few months in puppyhood but for several years, if not a lifetime. A dog who has been exposed to a variety of people and situations while young will be less stressed and less likely to overreact when confronted with something new as an adult. If you plan to show or compete with your Canaan in any type of dog sport, socialization and training are essential to your success. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.Some Canaan Dogs go through a fear period starting at 9 to 12 months of age, which can last for as long as a year. They may be especially anxious around strangers and bark at seemingly harmless objects. During this period, be calm and confident, showing him that he has nothing to fear. Trying to soothe him will only encourage him to believe that there really is something out there waiting to get him.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.","Canaans are a hardy breed and don't suffer from any known hereditary health problems.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Canaans, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","The Canaan's dense undercoat allows him to spend time outdoors in all kinds of weather, but when his people are home, he should be a housedog. He requires a securely fenced yard to protect him from traffic and from altercations with other dogs. With a consistent schedule, he's easy to housetrain.Canaans love to dig and can make quite large excavations in a short period if left to their own devices. Provide them with a digging area they can call their own or redirect the digging tendency with other activities.The Canaan doesn't require extensive exercise. He's usually satisfied with a couple of short walks a day or a walk plus some vigorous playtime in the backyard.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The outer coat is straight and harsh to the touch, lying flat on the body, with a slight ruff on the neck. The undercoat is short and soft. The thickness of the undercoat varies depending on the climate in which the dog lives. The bushy tail tapers to a pointed tip.Canaans can be predominantly white with a mask and sometimes additional large patches of color, or they can be a solid color, ranging from black to all shades of brown, including sandy, red, or liver, with or without white trim on the chest, belly, feet, lower part of the legs, and tail tip. Solid brown or tan dogs sometimes have shadings of black.Shedding is minimal, and little brushing is needed to keep the coat in good condition. Weekly brushing with a stiff bristle brush will do the trick, although you may need to brush more frequently during the twice yearly shedding of the undercoat. The Canaan Dog is a relatively clean dog with no doggie odor and does not require frequent bathing.Brush your Canaan's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Canaan enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Canaan to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Canaans are gentle with children, devoted and protective. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how loving, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Canaans can get along with other dogs, if they're brought up with them and socialized extensively, but they tend to play rough with a lot of vocalization. To people who don't know the breed, they may seem aggressive toward other dogs. They can be, but it's important to be able to tell the difference between rough play and true aggression. Study dog body language so you can know when to interfere and when to relax and let them be dogs. That said, adult Canaans are not the best candidates for playing at off-leash dog parks. They may try to bully or interfere with the play of other dogs. They can also be aggressive toward dogs of the same sex.Canaans do best with cats when they're raised with them and when the cat is savvy enough to stand up to the dog instead of running from him. Running activates the Canaan's prey drive, and he will give chase. The breed's strong prey drive can lead them to chase and kill small animals, especially those they find outdoors. They are probably not a good choice for families with pets such as rabbits, hamsters, and gerbils.","Canaan Dogs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Cane Corso,2,1,1,3,1,3,4,3,4,2,3,2,4,3,4,5,3,4,4,4,4,5,2,5,3,2,4,3,5,2,Working Dogs,"1 foot, 11 inches to 2 feet, 3 inches tall at the shoulder",90 to 120 pounds,10 to 12 years,"The Corso’s short coat comes in black, light, and dark shades of gray; light and dark shades of fawn; and red. Any of these colors may have a brindle pattern: irregular streaks of light and dark color.Solid fawn and red Corsos may have a black or gray mask.The Corso’s ears may be cropped or uncropped.The Corso is a working dog who needs lots of mental and physical stimulation.Corsos are not demonstrative, but they enjoy “talking” to their people with “woo woo woo” sounds, snorts, and other verbalizations.The Corso is not a good “first dog.” He requires plenty of socialization, training, and exercise to be a good companion.","The Corso is a large, muscular dog. Males stand 25 to 27.5 inches at the withers; females 23.5 to 26 inches. Weight is proportionate to height and typically ranges from 90 to 120 pounds.","The Corso’s history describes him as having a “vigorous temperament, ready to meet any challenge.” That type of temperament can be a double-edged sword. With a confident, consistent owner who provides good leadership and prevents the dog from roaming, the Corso can be an excellent family dog who is never inappropriately aggressive, but in the wrong hands he can become aggressive and be a danger to the public. In July, two Corsos were in the news after they attacked and killed a jogger.The ideal Corso is docile and affectionate toward his family, including children. To get him to that point requires socialization and training from an early age. This dog will not do well in a home with anyone who is afraid of or dislikes dogs or is unable to manage a large dog.The Corso is highly intelligent. Combine that with his bossy nature, and it’s easy to see how he could come to dominate the household without firm leadership and boundaries. He will test you to see how far he can go. It’s important to let him know from the start what the rules are and to ensure that all family members understand the rules as well. Institute a “nothing in life is free” policy by requiring him to perform a command such as “Sit” or “Down” before rewarding him with a meal, treats, or a toy.Firm leadership does not mean hitting the dog — ever. That not only sends the wrong message but can also be dangerous with a large, powerful dog. The sensitive Corso understands tone of voice and responds well to praise and rewards when he has done something you like as well as to firm, rapid corrections and consistent enforcement of rules when you don’t like what he’s doing. Being calm, quiet, and self-assured will get you a lot farther with this dog than angry bluster. Consistency will allow him to relax and know you are in charge.Help the young Corso develop confidence by letting him spend time alone. This can be outdoors in a confined area such as a yard or kennel or in his crate while you are busy around the house and can’t supervise. Being alone for varying periods teaches him he’s all right on his own and you always come back.Like every dog, the Corso needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — ideally before he is four months old. Socialization helps to ensure your Corso puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog, unafraid of strangers, children, other animals, or being left alone when necessary. Without a lot of experience of the world, he can easily become fearful or aggressive. The more you socialize him, the better able he will be to determine what’s normal behavior and what actions require him to respond in a protective way.According to the Italian breed standard, the Corso should be indifferent when approached and should only react when a real threat is present. The Corso is a working breed and is required to function under high levels of stress. A Corso who cannot maintain its dictated temperament under stressful situations is one with incorrect temperament for the breed.","Corsos are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Corsos will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.The Corso can be prone to hip dysplasia; eyelid abnormalities such as entropion, ectropion, and cherry eye; demodectic mange (which can be heritable); and gastric torsion, also known as bloat.Expect breeders to have up-to-date health clearances certifying that a puppy’s parents are free of eye disease and hip dysplasia. Clearances should be in the form of an eye exam by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist with the results registered with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and an OFA or Pennhip evaluation of the hips. You can confirm health clearances by checking the website of the Canine Health Information Center. You should also ask if any of the breeder’s dogs have ever suffered bloat or mange.","This working breed needs plenty of physical activity to stay in shape. Plan on taking him for a brisk walk or jog of at least a mile, morning and evening, every day. If you like to bicycle, get an attachment that will allow him to run alongside you.Go easy on puppies. Their musculoskeletal system isn’t fully developed until they are about 18 months old, so while they need more walks to help burn off their puppy energy, those walks should be shorter and slower.For mental stimulation, provide this dog with a job. Good employment for a Corso includes herding livestock (your own or a trainer’s), learning tricks, practicing obedience skills, or being involved in a dog sport. Spend at least 20 minutes a day on these types of activities. It’s okay to break it up: for instance, 10 minutes in the morning and 10 minutes in the evening.Never allow a Corso to run loose. A solid, secure fence is a must. An electronic fence will not prevent him from leaving your property if he chooses to, and it won’t protect your neighbor’s dog or cat if he wanders into your yard.Finally, be prepared for the amount of care and large bills that can go along with owning a large dog. There’s more poop to scoop, and essentials such as spay/neuter surgery are more expensive for big dogs than for small ones. If your Corso needs surgery for any other reason, the cost of anesthesia will be high because he needs more of it than a small dog, as well as larger amounts of pain medication after surgery. Finally, there are the costs of training class, entry fees for dog sports, and pet-sitting or boarding when you are away from home. Take all of these expenses into consideration before acquiring a Corso because you will be facing them for 10 to 12 years.","Recommended daily amount: If you are feeding a high-quality dry food, your Corso will probably eat 4 to 5 cups a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

It can be black, gray, red or fawn and may or may not have a brindle pattern. The coat sheds heavily twice a year, so have a good vacuum cleaner on hand to suck up the dust bunnies.If you plan to bathe your Corso on a regular basis, accustom him to the experience at an early age. Bathe him weekly as a young pup, teaching him the command “Bath,” so that he learns to expect and accept it. Give him plenty of praise and rewards to sweeten the deal.Brush your Cane Corso’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.To prevent painful tears and other problems, trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally.

It’s important, however, that puppies and adult dogs not be given any opportunity to chase children and that kids avoid making high-pitched sounds in his presence. Running and squealing may cause the Corso to associate children with prey. Keep him confined when kids are running around outdoors and making lots of noise, especially if your children have friends over. The Corso may think it necessary to step in and protect “his” kids, and that is unlikely to end well. Games of fetch or — for young children — helping to hold the leash are good ways for children to interact with a Cane Corso puppy or adult.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how loving, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Corso may get along with other dogs or cats if he is raised with them, but he will likely view strange animals as prey and do his best to kill them. It’s essential to be able to protect neighbors’ pets from him. This is another instance in which socialization is a must. Your Cane Corso should learn from an early age to remain calm in the presence of other dogs. If you do get a second dog, either another Cane Corso or a different breed, it is best to choose one of the opposite sex.","Some Corsos, purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one or given up because their families can no longer keep them, are in need of adoption or fostering.

Males weigh 30 to 38 pounds; females 25 to 34 pounds.,"The Cardigan doesn’t spend much time herding cattle these days, although he still has the instinct for it. He is a family companion and show dog with an adaptable personality and responsible nature. You will often find the Cardigan living with horse owners, who appreciate his assistance in loading their horses into trailers.The Cardigan can be less sociable and more territorial than the Pembroke. True to his herding dog heritage, the Cardi is an alert watchdog and may be reserved toward strangers. Expect him to bark a warning at the sight, scent or sound of anything unusual.He is a sturdy friend for children, and his intelligence makes him highly trainable. That said, he is an independent thinker and will often choose to do things his own way, adding a special Cardigan twist to obedience commands and other directives.Like every dog, the Cardigan needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences — ideally before he is four months old. Socialization helps to ensure that your Cardigan puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Cardigan Welsh Corgis are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Cardigans will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.In Cardigans, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that eyes are normal; and a DNA test for progressive retinal atrophy. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org) and the CERF web site (vmdb.org/cerf.html).Intervertebral Disk Disease: Because of their long backs, Cardigans are prone to ruptures in a spinal disc. Signs include unsteadiness, difficulty going up or down stairs or on and off furniture, knuckling over of limbs, weakness, and paralysis.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.","Like a fine sports car, the Cardigan has a body that is low-slung and fast. As a herding breed, he is capable of moving flocks long distances each day. Even if he doesn’t do that for a living anymore, he still needs daily exercise in the form of a walk or training for a dog sport such as agility. If he gets the activity he needs, the Cardigan is happy in any environment, from city condo to country estate.With his short legs and long back, the Cardigan can be prone to back injuries. Because their skeletal development is not yet complete, avoid letting puppies jump on and off furniture. Don’t pick them up without supporting both the front legs and the rear end.The Cardigan has a weather-resistant coat designed to withstand the harsh weather of Wales, but that doesn’t mean he’s an outside dog. He is highly people-oriented and should not be shunted off to the backyard with little human interaction.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food daily, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Cardigans like to eat, and will over-indulge if given the chance. Keep your Cardi in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Cardigan, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Cardis are double-coated, with a short undercoat and a longer, thick topcoat. They shed continuously, with periods of heavier shedding at least twice a year. Be prepared to brush a Cardigan frequently to keep flying hair under control. Daily brushing and warm baths to remove excess coat may be necessary during shedding season.The coat comes in all shades of red, sable, and brindle; black, with or without tan or brindle points; or blue merle, with or without tan or brindle points. They usually have white markings on the legs, chest, neck, muzzle, belly and tail tip and may have a blaze on the head.The length of the coat varies on the body. Some Cardis have soft, fluffy coats, which are not desirable because they don’t protect the dog from the elements.Many Cardigans have what is called a ""fairy saddle"" over their back. This marking takes its name from the legend that fairies rode the dogs in their home country of Wales.Brush your Cardigan’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.To prevent painful tears and other problems, trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding —  and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced at trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Check ears weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Cardigan to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently —  dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Cardigans love children, but their herding instincts can motivate them to nip at a youngster’s feet or ankles. They can learn quickly, however, that this behavior is not permitted.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Cardigans are usually friendly toward other pets in the household, so long as they have been socialized with them. They can be aggressive toward dogs that aren’t part of their family, but they enjoy having a second or third dog in the family to play with, especially another Corgi.","Some Cardigans, purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one or given up because their families can no longer keep them, are in need of adoption or fostering. Not all rescue groups are listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Cardigan rescue organization. ",Cardigan Welsh Corgi National Rescue Trust

If you cannot commit 100 percent to looking after this breed's needs, the Catahoula Bulldog is not the dog for you.","Catahoula Bulldogs are generally considered to be healthy dogs--although the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Catahoula Dog and American Bulldog face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Catahoula Bulldogs suffer from include:Dry noseAllergies","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Catahoula Bulldog's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Catahoula Bulldogs require lots of exercise--as with any dog, obesity can become an issue if suitably satisfying walks are not maintained. If you have access to very large, open outdoor spaces, this dog will enjoy running alongside you.Due to them being such an active canine, you should make sure to regularly check your Catahoula Bulldog's feet for any injuries that may have occurred while outdoors. This breed's nails will also need to be clipped--your vet can help you come up with a suitable foot and nail maintenance regime.","An ideal Catahoula Bulldog diet should be formulated for a medium to large breed with high energy.As with all dogs, the Catahoula Bulldog's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Catahoula Bulldog's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Catahoula Bulldogs come in a range of colors.

Thankfully, for a dog who loves to spend so much time engaging in energetic pursuits outside, the Catahoula Bulldog rarely suffers from any odor issues.As you'd expect for a dog with southern heritage, the breed does best in hotter climates. If you live in a place with harsh winters, the Catahoula Bulldog is not likely to appreciate the environment.","Catahoula Bulldogs are some of the most loyal dogs around.

He's a companion dog and does poorly in isolation.Because he may be aggressive toward unknown dogs, a Catahoula should never be walked off leash.Catahoulas are highly intelligent and need firm, patient, consistent training.Catahoulas are energetic dogs who need at least an hour of vigorous exercise daily.Catahoulas shed lightly to moderately year-round. They require weekly brushing to remove dead hair and keep their coat shiny.The Catahoula needs early and frequent socialization, especially if you want him to be friendly toward other animals.The Catahoula is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving.Catahoula puppies need tough, durable toys.The ideal home for a Catahoula is one with a fenced yard and opportunities for the dog to perform its natural work of tracking and herding.Catahoulas are protective of the children in their family, but they are not four-legged babysitters. Always supervise interactions between children and dogs.If properly socialized and raised with them, Catahoulas can do well with other dogs and animals. It is important to understand that some Catahoulas may never do well with other animals and may need to live in single animal homes.Catahoulas can be aggressive toward other dogs, especially if both dogs are male.Catahoulas are alert watchdogs and wary of strangers.Never buy a Catahoula from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.","Males, 22 to 26 inches at the shoulder and 65 to 90 pounds; females, 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder and 50 to 65 pounds.","The proper Catahoula is not aggressive toward people. He is wary of strangers but never shy. With family members, he is loving and protective. Males can be aggressive toward other male dogs, and Catahoulas in general work aggressively, a necessity in rounding up unruly hogs or cattle. Their instinct is to track and herd game, and if that isn't an option for them, they need some other outlet for their energy. Catahoulas are excellent watchdogs and will bark a warning or otherwise go on alert at the approach of strangers. Treat them firmly but fairly. They do not accept mistreatment or physical abuse.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents-usually the mother is the one who's available-to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, a Catahoula needs early socialization-exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences-when he's young, and it should continue throughout his life. Socialization helps ensure that your Catahoula puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Catahoulas are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Catahoulas will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.In Catahoulas, look for health clearances on both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation, certifying that the eyes are healthy.The following problems may occur in the breed:Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD). This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint, eventually causing lameness or arthritis. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred.Deafness: Because Catahoulas carry the gene for merle coloration, which is linked to deafness, unilateral (one-sided) and bilateral (both sides) hearing loss is also a concern in the breed. Before purchasing, test a puppy's hearing by standing behind it and clapping your hands or making some other unexpected noise and see if it responds. You can also have the dog's hearing tested at a BAER (brainstem auditory evoked response) facility recommended by your veterinarian.","The Catahoula is not a dog that can be tied out in the yard and left on his own. He needs companionship and exercise and should be as familiar with the inside of your home as the yard.Underground electronic fences are not suitable for this breed. A Catahoula will ignore the shock if he sees another dog approaching his territory, and the lack of a solid barrier means that other dogs can enter the yard, which can lead to a serious fight.Expect to give him at least an hour of exercise daily. Engage his mind with training sessions or fun activities.Begin training the day you bring your Catahoula puppy home. He is intelligent and learns quickly, but he needs a strong leader. For best results, be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Catahoula. Let him know what you expect, and then let him go to work. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions. Harsh corrections can damage the dog's self-confidence and personality. Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Catahoula is destructive in his attempts to entertain himself.If you are consistent and follow a schedule, housetraining comes easily to the Catahoula. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your Catahoula puppy from chewing on things he shouldn't or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren't around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he's feeling overwhelmed or tired. Never use a crate as a place of punishment.Leash training is also important, especially since your Catahoula will be a strong puller. Good leash manners are essential to the state of your muscles, your own happiness, and your Catahoula's safety. He has a strong prey drive, so never walk him off leash any place that he might encounter unknown dogs or other animals.Early, frequent socialization is a must for this breed, especially if you want your Catahoula to be friendly toward or at least tolerate other animals, especially other dogs. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn't end there. Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events, and introduce him to as many people as possible, both in your home and in publicWith proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Catahoula will be a wonderful family member who protects and loves you unconditionally.","Recommended daily amount: 3 3/8 to 5 1/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.

Its texture may range from smooth to coarse.Catahoulas are found in many coat colors and patterns. They may have color points, or trim, located on the chest, cheeks, above the eyes, or on the legs, underbody or under the tail. The leopard pattern has a base color with contrasting spots of one or more other colors. Solids have a single coat color. Brindles may have a light or dark base coat color with contrasting stripes. Catahoulas with a patchwork coat may or may not have one predominant solid color with one or more different size patches of different colors and shades placed randomly on the body. Rich, deep colors are preferable to the lighter colors, but no coat color or pattern is more valuable than another.A weekly brushing keeps the Catahoula's coat clean and shiny and helps reduce shedding. The coat sheds lightly to moderately year-round. A bath is usually necessary only a couple of times a year.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Catahoula's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don't get caught in the carpet and tearCheck the ears weekly to make sure there's no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean the ears as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog's breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don't stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger.Begin accustoming your Catahoula to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Some breeders describe the Catahoula as a great babysitter for kids. The Catahoula is suitable for families with children, but despite his family loyalty and protectiveness, he should always be supervised in the presence of toddlers or young children. He can be rambunctious and may accidentally knock small children down. And like any dog, he may mistake children at eye level as attempting to challenge him.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any mouthing, biting, or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating and not to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Some Catahoulas get along well with other dogs and cats when they're raised with them. As adults, they may require more of an adjustment period before they welcome the company of another dog. To ensure the best relationship, choose a dog of the opposite sex. Make introductions in a neutral area away from your home.","Catahoulas are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Catahoulas end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died.

However, the Caucasian Shepherd Dogs from Georgia are generally considered to be the breed standard by most kennel clubs.Female Caucasian Shepherd Dogs only give birth once a year.Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are fierce guardians of their territory, but they are also fairly low-energy dogs. Weight gain is a strong possibility and should be addressed with proper diet and exercise.The communist USSR used this breed to guard prisoners and kept dogs in army kennels to create new breeds for military use.East Germany used Caucasian Shepherd Dogs to patrol the border created by the Berlin Wall. When the wall came down, dogs were given to German families to live out the rest of their days.The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is one of the most ancient Molosser breeds. Some archaeological findings trace them back to Mesopotamia.Caucasian Shepherd Dog coats come in three lengths and a huge variety of colors. They shed quite a bit, but their thick coats keep them warm even in extremely cold weather.While they are naturally standoffish to strangers and don't take well to other animals, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can be very gentle and loving, and some have even become therapy dogs with proper training.","Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are massive. Males tend to be a bit larger than females and weigh in at 110 to 220 pounds, while females average around 100 to 180 pounds. Some dogs may weigh more or less, and this can depend on where they come from or what type they are. Mountain dogs are more muscular, while plain dogs are a bit leaner. Males are about 27 to 30 inches in height at the shoulder, and females are between 25 and 28 inches. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are considered to be a giant breed.","The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is not for novice dog owners. While they are capable of being loving, loyal family dogs and fierce protectors, they are also naturally distrustful of strangers and do not take well to dogs or other animals that they aren't familiar with. In general, they are low energy and laid back, but they are also highly territorial and never back down from a fight, even if that means taking on a bear or a wolf. Although Caucasian Shepherd Dogs are intelligent, they can also be quite stubborn, which may make training difficult. They need firm boundaries, patience, and consistency. This training should begin as early in life as possible, and socialization is practically a must. Proper socialization training has to be done to overcome the breed's apprehension around new people and animals, which can result in aggression. However, with humans they are familiar with, the Caucasian Shepherd is quite loving and loyal and will make for a lifelong guardian and protector.","The Caucasian Shepherd Dog is mostly considered to be a healthy breed, but like many giant breeds, they can be prone to hip dysplasia. They may also develop cataracts. One of the most common problems they face is obesity. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs should be fed an appropriate diet for a giant breed, but they do not have overly high energy levels, and that should be taken into consideration. They will need to be exercised, and their weight should be monitored by veterinarians. To prevent obesity in your Caucasian Shepherd Dog, talk to your veterinarian or nutritionist about formulating an appropriate diet and creating an exercise regimen. Your vet may recommend feeding them smaller, more frequent meals during the day rather than large ones to avoid bloat.","The main form of care that Caucasian Shepherd Dogs need is weight control through appropriate diet and exercise. You should discuss these with your veterinarian or nutritionist. Beyond that, Caucasian Shepherd Dogs should have their teeth brushed two to three times a week and cleaned professionally as recommended by your vet. Ears should be checked for signs of debris or wax build up at least once a week and cleaned as needed. Failure to do so may result in ear infections. Nails should be clipped as needed to prevent breaking and injury. You may also need to keep an eye out for drool and wipe it away when necessary to avoid getting your home covered in slobber.","Caucasian Shepherd Dogs should be fed a diet formulated for a giant breed with fairly low energy levels. You should ask your veterinarian or a professional nutritionist to help you find the right kind of food and portion size for your individual dog. The appropriate diet will change from puppyhood to adulthood and may be altered depending on medical needs. There is some risk that Caucasian Shepherd Dogs will overeat and gain weight, so make sure you are sticking to the appropriate recommended meal plan. Smaller, more frequent meals may be recommended to prevent dogs from developing bloat, a life-threatening condition.","There are three coat lengths seen in Caucasian Shepherd Dogs--long, medium, and short. The longer the hair, the more pronounced the mane is around their necks and the feathering is around their hind legs and tails. All three lengths of coat are quite thick. They are double-coated, with the undercoat being fine and soft, while the outer coat is coarse and longer. The Caucasian Shepherd Dog can be gray, fawn, red, cream, tan, and even solid white. Coats may also be brindle or have large patches of two or more colors. They often have white markings on the body and a dark ""mask"" around the face. The thick coat should be brushed at least twice a week to remove loose or dead hairs and prevent matting. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs go through a heavy shed once a year. Bathing and extra brushing can help move this shedding along more quickly. Bathing can be a chore with a dog this size, so it may be wise to just bath them as needed or rely on a professional groomer.","Caucasian Shepherd Dogs can be loving family pets that are very loyal, even toward children, but it is very important to begin their socialization training early. It is in their nature to be cautious around strangers, even to the point of aggression at times, and they do not take well to other dogs unless they have been properly socialized. Visiting children will need a calm, proper introduction with known humans present, and Caucasian Shepherds tend to be territorial and aggressive to other dogs unless they have been raised with them. Their natural herding instincts can take over, causing them to be pushy toward children, and they may see rough play from new kids as an attack on their human family member and respond accordingly. Remember, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog was bred to be intimidating and will not hesitate to spring into action to defend their home and family from perceived threats. As with any dog, children should be supervised during play and trained on how to handle animals to avoid incident. Even with a well-trained Caucasian Shepherd, their sheer size may be an issue, and it is important to watch them so play doesn't get out of hand and result in injury. Caucasian Shepherd Dogs may be best suited to homes with older children and no other pets.","If you're interested in adopting a Caucasian Shepherd Dog, you may want to keep an eye on Caucasian Ovcharka Rescue Rehome USA on Facebook, as they specialize in finding homes for the breed.

That said, as a mix between Cavalier King Charles and Bichon Frise parents, you can expect Cavachons to be on the small side.Most weigh in at 15 to 35 pounds and range in height from twelve to 13 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger.","Many Cavachon lovers describe these dogs' personalities as ""happy."" They are the size of your average lap dog and enjoy a cuddle or nap as much as they enjoy being out and about on the town seeing the sights. They are easy going and enjoy it all, just so long as they are with their favorite person--you!They aren't overly energetic, but they don't sleep all day, either. Their energy level is middle of the road. They are not overly barky but may alert when guests arrive. Some of their parent Cavaliers are described as barky and some are not. It's really difficult to know until you get to know them to see which parental traits are dominant.These dogs are charmers and may want to meet everyone who crosses their paths. If you take them with you for an out-and-about-ing, allow extra time for meet and greets.Cavachons are smart and eager to learn. Make sure to keep training sessions short and to the point so they don't get overly stimulated or bored. Be consistent, and be gentle. Many dogs do not react well to negative feedback. Encourage the positive behavior to help keep your pup on track and eager to please you.They love being lavished with attention and will accept spoils from any family member.","The Cavachon mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Cavalier and Bichon parents also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health concerns to watch out for in Cavachons include:Mitral Valve DiseaseHeart MurmurSyringomyeliaAtopic DermatitisCataractsCushing's DiseasePatellar Luxation","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Cavachon's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Cavachons have a moderate amount of energy. One half hour walk with some moderate activities in between should keep your Cavachon happy and stimulated.Also, the usual canine care is always required for every dog. Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking loudly against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Cavachon's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.All dogs must be walked on leashes and Cavachons, especially. While they are not high energy dogs, they may see a bird or other small animal and dart after it.Cavachons do not like to be left alone for long periods of time and, if isolated, could exhibit destructive behavior. If you plan to crate your pup, crate training must start at puppyhood.","An ideal Cavachon diet should be formulated for a small breed with moderate energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Cavachon's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Cavachon's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.Keep your Cavachon in good shape by measuring their food and feeding them twice a day, rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether they're overweight, give them the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at them. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on their back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, they need less food and more exercise.","Cavachon coats are often a mix of their Cavalier King Charles and Bichon Frise parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Cavachons are cream, white, and pied. Few coats are solid, and they almost always have a combination of colors.Cavachons usually have medium-length coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. There are longer-coated Cavachons, too, though they may not be as allergy friendly. Luckily, both coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing three to four times a week should do the trick. They should be bathed as necessary, and you should consult your groomer for grooming recommendations.Cavachons aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.","Cavachons are good family dogs and wonderful companions for children. They enjoy palling around with kids, joining in their games or sitting in their laps. They're very tolerant of the noise and commotion associated with children.As with every breed, however, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away.

They love to be with people and shouldn't be left alone for long periods of time.Your Cavalier will shed, especially in the spring and fall. Regular combing and brushing is required.Because he's a spaniel at heart, he may try to chase birds, rabbits and other small prey if he isn't kept on leash or in a fenced yard.Cavaliers may bark when someone comes to your door, but because of their friendly nature, they aren't good guard dogs.Cavaliers are housedogs and should not live outdoors.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","This small but sturdy dog stands 12 to 13 inches at the shoulder and weighs 13 to 18 pounds. There is no such thing as a ""toy"" Cavalier, and you would do well to avoid buying a Cavalier from a breeder who offers dogs half that size.","The gregarious Cavalier takes as his role model humorist Will Rogers, who famously said he never met a stranger. The Cavalier is eager to meet everyone who crosses his path, and if that person sits down and offers a lap (or a treat), so much the better.Like any dog, Cavaliers come in a range of personalities, from quiet and sedate to rowdy and rambunctious. They might or might not bark when someone comes to the door, so they're a poor choice as a watchdog — except, that is, for watching the burglar cart off the silver. There are exceptions, of course — some Cavaliers will inform you of every event in your neighborhood and bark ferociously when strangers approach — but overall you're better off buying an alarm system than counting on your Cavalier to alert you to trouble.","Cavaliers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Cavaliers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Cavaliers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Mitral Valve Disease (MVD): This is a common condition in Cavaliers. It starts with a heart murmur that becomes increasing worse until the dog has heart failure. Heart disease in older dogs of any breed is fairly common, but Cavaliers are prone to developing MVD at an early age, sometimes as young as one or two years old. Research into prevention of this condition is ongoing. Because it appears to have a genetic component, responsible breeders have their breeding dogs evaluated regularly by veterinary cardiologists to try to prevent this condition from continuing to future generations.Syringomyelia (SM): This condition affects the brain and spine and appears to be common in Cavaliers. Symptoms range from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis. It's caused by a malformation of the skull, which reduces the space for the brain. Symptoms typically appear between the ages of 6 months and 4 years. The first signs you might notice are sensitivity around the head, neck, or shoulders, with the dog sometimes whimpering, or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder, usually just on one side of the body, without actually making physical contact with the body (""air scratching""). They may try to scratch even when walking. For this reason, if your Cavalier is scratching, it's important to take him to the vet to rule out SM. For more information, visit Syringomyelia.Episodic Falling: This condition often is confused with epilepsy, but the dog remains conscious during the falling or seizure. It's brought about because the dog can't relax its muscles. Symptoms can range from mild, occasional falling episodes to seizure-like episodes that last for hours. Symptoms usually start before five months but may be noticed only later in life.Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Cavaliers often are able to lead normal, healthy lives. On rare occasions, one may require surgery to lead a normal life.Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (Dry Eye): This condition usually is caused by an autoimmune reaction to the dog's tear glands, leading to a reduction of tears. Once diagnosed, this condition is easily treated by administering drops in the eyes every day. If left untreated, it can result in blindness.","Their size and generally quiet nature make Cavalier King Charles Spaniels good candidates for apartment or condo living. They are moderately active indoors, and a small yard is adequate for their exercise needs.Walks on leash or a securely fenced yard are musts with this breed. They have no street smarts and will run right in front of a car if they catch sight of a bird or other interesting prey. Your Cavalier will enjoy a daily walk or romp in the yard and will tailor his activity level to your own. Because he's a rather short-nosed breed, avoid walking him during the heat of the day and never leave him out in a hot yard without access to shade or cool, fresh water.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Cavalier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.If you feed a canned or raw diet, it's a good idea to cover the ears with a snood, or headband, or pull them back with a hair scrunchy while your Cavalier eats. Otherwise, he'll end up with food in his fur — not a good look. For both water and food, look for bowls with a narrow diameter so the ears don't drag in them.For more on feeding your Cavalier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Cavaliers are adorned with medium-length coats that are silky to the touch and may be slightly wavy. Adult Cavaliers have feathering on their ears, chest, legs, feet and tail.Cavaliers come in four colors:Blenheim, a rich chestnut on a pearly white background. Some Blenheims have a thumb-shaped chestnut dot on top of the forehead, called a lozenge.Tricolor, black markings on a white coat with tan markings over the eyes, on the cheeks, and on the underside of the tailBlack and Tan, black with tan markings over the eyes, on the cheeks, inside the ears, and on the chest, legs and underside of the tailRuby, a solid rich reddish-brown with no white spots or markingsBlenheim is the most common color, but the others aren't rare.Cavaliers are fairly easy to maintain. You need to comb or brush them three or four times a week and bathe them as necessary. For a dog that enjoys playing outdoors as well as spending a lot of time on your bed or other furniture, that might be weekly.The feathered hair on the ears and legs is prone to tangling, so check those areas frequently for mats that need to be gently combed out. Trim the hair between the pads on the feet and clean your Cavalier's ears regularly. The only real difficulty is keeping white paws looking pristine instead of dingy.Cavaliers are average shedders. They don't need any special trimming or clippering; in fact, it's preferred for the feathering to remain natural, although some people trim the feet for neatness' sake. Others of us like the furry-footed hobbit look.Brush your Cavalier's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Cavalier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Cavalier to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Cavaliers can be great playmates for kids who will enjoy throwing a ball for them, teaching them tricks, participating in dog sports, or simply having them on a lap while they read or watch television. Because of their small size, however, they should be supervised when playing with small children who might injure them accidentally.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.They get along well with other dogs and can learn to play nice with cats and other pets if introduced to them at an early age. It helps if the cat is willing to stand up for herself because a Cavalier enjoys a good game of chase. They even enjoy it if the cat chases back. Some Cavaliers live peaceably with pet birds while others try to eat them — or at the very least pull their tails. Always supervise your Cavalier's interactions with birds and other small animals; they can have a strong hunting instinct.","Cavaliers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Cavaliers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Cavalier rescue.Cavalier Rescue USAACKCS Trust ","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club, Inc."

As long as you can commit to regular walking sessions, these dogs can usually adapt to living in smaller home situations that might not have unfettered outdoor access.","Chabradors are generally considered to be healthy dogs--although the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chow Chow and Labrador Retriever face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Chabradors suffer from include:Cerebellar AbiotrophyCataractsPatellar LuxationHip Dysplasia","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Chabrador's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Despite the Labrador Retriever having a reputation as an exceptionally active dog, Chabradors are happy and healthy with moderate amounts of exercise. Aiming for about 60 minutes of activity time each day should see you good--although it should be noted that the Chabrador can be a very enthusiastic walking and playtime partner, so be prepared to keep things upbeat!Satisfying the breed's innate intelligence also means that interactive toys and variety in playtime is key.When it comes to maintenance, pay special attention to your Chabrador's ears. It's vital to keep them dry and clean--otherwise you can risk infection. Ask your vet if you need guidance on how best to care for this breed's ears. Trim nails if they get too long. They should not click loudly against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.","An ideal Chabrador diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with medium energy.Chabradors need to stick to a heathy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems.As with all dogs, the Chabrador's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years.

The coats are usually solid, although spotting is sometimes present.Chabradors posses dense, double-layered, waterproof coats that are short to medium in length. This breed is a shedder. You'll need to take up brushing sessions at least twice a week to lessen the chances of mats developing and to keep things clean and healthy. When it comes to bath time, once a month should usually suffice.With such a special thick coat, the Chabrador understandably does not thrive in hotter and more humid climates. But if you live in a place with strong winters, the Chabrador might very well become a perfect outdoor walking companion for your lifestyle!","A well-trained Chabrador can be a great addition to a family and will form strong and loyal bonds with your kids. Their guardianship instincts will also kick in if strangers are around. However, it's is absolutely vital that this breed undergoes properly-structured and responsible training at the earliest age.When it comes to other pets, the Labrador Retirever heritage of the Chabrador can often result in the breed deciding to chase after smaller animals. Supervise early interactions if you have an existing family pet, and always exercise caution.Ultimately, early socialization pays off--so make sure to reward your Chabrador for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regime when you bring them home to your family.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Chabradors because they are a mixed breed.

They are not purebreds like their Chihuahua or Beagle parents.Cheagles are prone to weight gain if they are overfed. Stick to an appropriate diet and feeding schedule.The main colors of Cheagles are combinations of brown, black, white, and cream. Sometimes their coats are solid, but usually a combination of colors.Breeders started intentionally mixing Chihuahuas and Beagles to make Cheagles in the late 1990s.Cheagles have high energy and prefer an active play session to being a lap dog.Cheagles tend to bark often, which makes them good watchdogs. However, early training can help curb unwanted barking tendencies.Because Cheagles tend to be small, they can be easily injured by children who play rough. They may prefer homes with older kids or children who have been taught how to handle small animals.","The Cheagle is a relatively new breed, so there are few standards when it comes to size. As a mix between Chihuahua and Beagle parents, you can expect Cheagles to be on the small side.Most weigh in at 20 to 30 pounds and range in height from nine to 14 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger depending on which parents genes are more dominant.","Many Cheagle lovers describe these dogs' personalities as loyal and fun-loving. Although they are the size of your average lap dog, their high energy levels mean they'd probably prefer a game of fetch to a cuddle session.Some Cheagles may have a prey drive, though most seem to have lost the hunting tendencies of their Beagle parents. They do, however, love to bark. If you want a watchdog who will alert you to anyone at your door, you can't do much better than the Cheagle.They can be stubborn and difficult to train, but for a patient, consistent owner, their loyalty and desire to please will help training go a bit more smoothly. Treat rewards may also help them to be more agreeable.They also tend to latch on to one family member most of all, though they can get along with others in the house. Cheagles may be best suited to a one-person home or families with older children.","The Cheagle breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and Beagle also face.

Luckily, both parents' coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do. Baths should be sparse as they tend to get dry, flaky skin, and they need their natural oils for optimum radiance.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Cheagles aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.","Because the Cheagle is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Cheagles prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. The Cheagle can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, Cheagles can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly.

If they don't receive adequate exercise, they can become frustrated and destructive.Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are not recommended for inexperienced or first-time dog owners.They can be prone to dominance problems if not properly trained and socialized. You must provide strong leadership without being harsh.Chessies can be more aggressive, willful, and reserved with strangers than other retrievers.Chesapeake Bay Retrievers may be combative toward other dogs.Chessies are strong dogs, slow to mature, with a tendency to be territorial. They need firm training and management.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 23 to 26 inches at the shoulder and weigh 65 to 80 pounds; females 21 to 24 inches and 55 to 70 pounds.,"A proper Chessie has a bright and happy disposition combined with courage, intelligence, a strong work ethic, and an alert nature that makes him an excellent watchdog. He's strongminded, though — read: stubborn — and requires firm, consistent training by all the adults in the household. You can't let him do something ""just this once,"" or you'll spend days or weeks retraining him. If you're providing the right leadership, a sharp look or verbal reprimand is enough to rein in bad behavior; more severe punishment is overkill and will only cause him to become sulky and unresponsive.The Chessie can have a goofy sense of humor, but the entertainment value can be offset by his sometimes obsessive stubbornness. Once he gets an idea into his head, it can be hard to remove. And when he wants something, he will be persistent in going after it. That's great if you have him retrieving ducks, not so great if he's bugging you for something else, like a kid in the grocery store who wants candy.Temperament doesn't occur in a vacuum. It's affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Socialization helps ensure that your Chessie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Chessies are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Chessies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're buying or living with a Chessie.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Von Willebrand's Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand's disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Epilepsy: Chessies can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Chessie has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.Chondrodysplasia: This genetic disorder is commonly mislabeled as ""dwarfism."" Dogs with the deformity have abnormally short limbs for the breed. It ranges in severity from ""nearly normal"" to severe crippling. In less severe cases, dogs have lived full and healthy lives but a dog that is diagnosed with chondrodysplasia or screened as a carrier should not be bred so as not to pass on the genes for the condition.","Chesapeake Bay Retrievers like a cool climate. They do best in a warm climate if they have frequent opportunities to swim. Chessies require a great deal of exercise to remain happy, and if they do they're quiet housedogs who will be happy to relax with you while you watch TV. Give him a minimum of 20 minutes per day of intensive work, training, water retrieves, or play, or up to an hour of a more sedate walk. Chessies love to swim and do well if swimming can be included in their daily exercise regime. They are a country or suburban dog, not a city dog.Puppies have special exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch or let them splash in a kiddie pool. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. Start teaching them how to swim in a pool or lake, weather permitting. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he's a year old, your Chessie pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.Chessies work well with people, but they can be independent, with a mind of their own. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Chessie who's treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting and make him feel as if he has a choice in what he's doing.When your Chessie does something inappropriate such as countersurfing or lifting his leg in the house, you must let him know right then and there — loudly and firmly — that his behavior is unacceptable and not to ever be repeated. No exceptions!","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl. Puppies eat a lot, but err on the side of slenderness to protect their still developing joints. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs, and they should have a visible waist when you look down at them. A four-month-old puppy may eat two cups of adult food or large-breed puppy food twice a day, for a total of four cups.For more on feeding your Chessie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","As befits his purpose as a water retriever, the Chessie has a coat that resists water in the same way that a duck's feathers do. The top coat is short, thick, harsh, and oily, and the undercoat is fine, dense, and woolly. Together, they provide super insulation, allowing him to hunt in all conditions, including ice and snow. The oily outercoat and woolly undercoat prevent cold water <p>When your Chessie does something inappropriate such as countersurfing or lifting his leg in the house, you must let him know right then and there — loudly and firmly — that his behavior is unacceptable and not to ever be repeated. No exceptions!</p>from reaching his skin and help him to dry quickly. After he leaves the water and shakes, his coat is merely moist because it doesn't hold water.The Chessie's coat is meant to help him blend in to his surroundings — canine camouflage, as it were. He can be any shade of brown, sedge, or the dull tan or strawlike color known as deadgrass, a perfectly descriptive term.Deadgrass has no red tones. Deadgrass can vary from almost yellow to tan. Sedge is an almost strawberry blonde coloration with definite reddish undertones on a relatively light-colored coat. Brown is darker and may have red undertones (light brown, brown and dark brown).Occasionally the Chessie may have a white spot on the chest, belly, toes, or back of the feet immediately above the large pad.Like most retriever breeds, Chessies shed heavily. Brush the coat weekly with a rubber curry brush to remove dead hair and distribute the skin oils throughout the coat. Regular brushing will help keep loose hair on the brush and off your clothes and furniture. Avoid using a wire slicker brush or coat rake, which can break down the wave and kink in the hair. Bathe a Chessie as little as possible to avoid stripping out the protective oils and destroying the coat's water resistance. A warm bath or two during shedding season helps release dead hair, however, so the new coat can grow in.","In general, Chessies love kids but won't put up with a lot of harassment, instead preferring to walk away. They can, however, be possessive of food and toys, which can make them a poor match for homes with young children. They are protective of children but can misinterpret their play with their friends and react inappropriately. Many breeders won't sell Chessie puppies to families with children younger than 8 years of age. An adult Chessie who's familiar with children is a better match for a family with young kids.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Chessies can be aggressive toward strange dogs, but should get along fine with other family dogs and cats if they're raised with them.","Chesapeake Bay Retrievers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least 2 years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed, such as luxating patellas (bum knees) and heart disease.Both parents should have health clearances, documentation that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Chihuahuas, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for patellas and heart disease. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That's because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it's often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.The following conditions may affect Chihuahuas:Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a possible problem with all toy breed puppies. [Note: I have left this as toy breed here. There is a difference between toy size and small dogs-the difference, say, between Chihuahuas and yorkies and beagles and mini dachshunds.] Hypoglycemia is easily treatable in the early stages but can be fatal if not treated. It is important that breeders and owners of toy breed puppies recognize the signs and symptoms because this condition can sometimes be misdiagnosed as viral hepatitis or encephalitis by veterinarians. A puppy with hypoglycemia will slow down and become listless, followed by trembling or shivering. Place some honey under his tongue and get him to the vet immediately. If the situation is allowed to continue, he'll eventually collapse, go into convulsions, fall into a coma, and die. Any time your Chihuahua is limp, with grayish-blue gums and tongue, it's an emergency. Hypoglycemia occurs in toy puppies when they don't have the fat reserves to supply adequate glucose in times of stress or when they don't eat regularly.Heart Murmurs: Heart murmurs are caused by adisturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They're an indicator that there may be a disease or condition of the heart that will need to be monitored and treated. Heart murmurs are graded on their loudness, with one being very soft and five being very loud. If disease is evident, as diagnosed through x-rays and an echocardiogram, the dog may require medication, a special diet, and a reduction in the amount of exercise he gets.Pulmonic Stenosis: This congenital heart disease occurs when blood doesn't flow properly through the heart because the pulmonic valve is malformed, causing an obstruction. This means the heart must work harder and can become enlarged, leading to heart failure. Treatment depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, there's little or no obstruction and no treatment is necessary. If the dog is severely affected by the disease, surgery is recommended, but the procedure differs depending on the location of the blockage.Collapsed Trachea: It is not completely understood how this occurs, but the rapid inhalation of air causes the trachea to flatten and makes it difficult for air to enter the lungs, much like a soda straw being drawn on too vigorously. This condition may be inherited; it occurs in certain breeds, and dogs with it show an abnormality in the chemical makeup of their tracheal rings in which the rings lose their stiffness and become unable to retain their circular shape.Hydrocephalus: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can accumulate in the brain because of a congenital defect, obstruction, or the result of trauma during birth, placing pressure on the brain. The head looks swollen or enlarged, but the diagnosis can be confirmed with an ultrasound if necessary. There's no cure for hydrocephalus, although in mild cases steroids can help reduce fluid pressure. A shunt can also be used to divert fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Puppies with severe cases usually die before they're four months old, which is a good reason to delay purchasing a Chihuahua until that age.Open Fontanel: Chihuahuas are born with a soft spot on the top of their head. Usually the soft spot closes, much like a baby's will, but sometimes one will not close fully. Treat these dogs gingerly. An accidental blow to the head can kill them.Shivering: Shivering is a common occurrence in Chihuahuas. The mechanics of why they shiver or tremble is unclear but it usually occurs when the dog is excited, stressed, or cold.","Despite the Chihuahua's small size, like all dogs he needs exercise and training. The amount of energy an adult Chihuahua has can be surprising. He'll endlessly chase squirrels in the backyard and is willing to play as long as you are. Chihuahuas enjoy walks, supervised romps around the yard, and retrieving toys. They'll go until they drop, so it's important to make sure they don't tire themselves out, especially on hot days.As much as they enjoy playing outdoors, Chihuahuas should never live outside. They aren't safe from raptors such as hawks, coyotes, or other larger dogs that could go into your yard. They are bred as companions, and the best place for a companion is with you.Training a Chihuahua can be an enjoyable task. They are successful in several different dog sports such as agility and obedience, but puppy kindergarten and basic obedience class are important even for a Chihuahua who's strictly a companion. Your Chihuahua will meet many different dogs and people in class, contributing to his socialization, and he'll learn the manners all dogs should know.Chihuahuas are as easy to housetrain as any other breed as long as you take them out frequently and on a consistent schedule. Puppies need to go out as soon as they wake up in the morning, after every meal, after naps, after playtime, and just before bedtime. Using a crate to confine them when you're unable to supervise them will teach them that they can control their bladder and prevent them from having accidents in the house. If they're not crated, plan to take them out every one to two hours, and don't crate them for more than two to four hours at a time except overnight.Beyond housetraining, crate training is a kind way to ensure that your Chihuahua doesn't get into things he shouldn't. Like every dog, Chihuahuas can be destructive as puppies. They might not do as much damage as a Lab puppy, but those little teeth can definitely leave their mark. Crate training at a young age will also help your Chihuahua accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Chihuahua in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Chihuahuas are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.Train your Chihuahua using positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and you will soon find that he can learn anything you can teach.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cups of high-quality dry food a dayNOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Chihuahua, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Chihuahuas come in two different coat types: smooth and long. The smooth-coated Chihuahua has a smooth, shiny coat that fits close to the body with a ruff of thick, longer hair on the neck. The hair on the head and ears is thinner, and the tail is furry.The long-coated Chihuahua has a soft coat that's flat or slightly curly. On the body it's almost as smooth as that of a smooth-coated Chihuahua, but the ears have a fringe of hair, and the plumed tail spreads out like a fan over the back. He also has a ruff on the neck and longer hair called feathering on his feet. The hind legs are also covered with long hair that resembles pants — and that's what it's called. On the stomach is longer hair known as a frill.Besides coming in two coat types, Chihuahuas are found in a range of colors and markings. They can be solid colors such as black, white, fawn, chocolate, gray, and silver as well as tricolor (chocolate, black, or blue with tan and white, for instance), brindle, spotted, merle and a variety of other markings. Shades can be very pale to very dark for all the colors.The Chihuahua is a wash-and-go dog. Grooming him takes only a few minutes each week. Brush him weekly with a rubber grooming mitt or a brush with short, natural bristles for a shorthaired Chihuahua and a pin brush for a longhaired Chihuahua. A fine-toothed flea comb helps remove loose or dead hair.Chihuahuas shed small amounts year round and may shed somewhat more heavily — a relative term for a dog this small — in the spring and fall. The longhaired Chihuahua's undercoat may come out in little clumps. Regular brushing will help keep shedding under control.With regular brushing, a Chihuahua shouldn't need a bath more than every month or two. Use a shampoo formulated for dogs so you don't dry out the coat and skin.Ears are an important area to check when you are grooming your Chihuahua. If you smell an odor or see wax, clean the inner ear with a cotton ball, using a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Avoid going into the depth of the ear, past where you can see. If the ears are dry along the edge, rub a little baby or coconut oil onto them.Some Chihuahuas develop tear stains beneath their eyes. You can carefully wipe the eyes to remove discharge, and there are products available to remove the stains.A Chihuahua's nails grow quickly. Keep them trimmed short. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. The earlier you introduce your Chihuahua to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is. At the same time, check the pads for any foreign objects or injuries.Like many small breeds, Chihuahuas are prone to poor dental health. Brushing their teeth can help their mouths stay healthy. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he'll be used to it.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Many Chihuahuas love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Chihuahua may leap from a child's hands and injure himself if he's not being held correctly, and he won't hesitate to defend himself if he's being mistreated. Many breeders won't sell puppies to families with toddlers for fear that the dog will be injured. Chihuahuas do best in families with quiet, older children who understand how to interact with them.Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Chihuahua if they're sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Even if your family doesn't have children, your Chihuahua should always be exposed to them when he's young so he won't be fearful of them if he encounters them later in life. Just be sure you supervise carefully.Chihuahuas get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Chihuahua will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It's not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge.","Chihuahuas are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Chihuahuas end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. Adopting an adult Chihuahua has many benefits. Adult dogs are often already housetrained and have some obedience training, and they've already gone through the destructive puppy stage. Because Chihuahuas have such a long life span, adopting an adult dog can bring you many years of pleasurable companionship.Chihuahua Club of AmericaChihuahua RescueChihuahua Rescue and TransportCanadian Chihuahua Rescue and TransportChihuahua Rescue CanadaYankee Chihuahua Rescue and Adoption","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Chihuahua.Chihuahua Club of America, Inc."
Chinese Crested,3,5,3,5,1,1,3,4,4,5,4,4,2,2,1,2,5,2,2,3,4,3,4,3,3,1,2,1,2,3,Companion Dogs,"11 inches to 1 foot, 1 inch tall at the shoulder",Up to 12 pounds,10 to 14 years,"Chinese Cresteds are a small breed suitable for many kinds of dwellings, including apartments.A genetic link exists between dominant hairlessness and missing teeth. It is not a sign of ""bad breeding"" but simply goes along with the breed.A Chinese Crested should not be left out in the yard alone or be left off-leash on walks. Tiny as he is, large dogs could view him as prey. He can easily escape through fences, and he can jump even high ones.Although Chinese Cresteds do well with children, the age and personality of the children should be taken under consideration before getting a one of these dogs. They can be hurt easily because of their tiny size.The fact that he's an exotic-looking dog might draw you to a Chinese Crested, but understand that they can be as temperamental as the next dog — and more so than some breeds.They have a stubborn streak.Chinese Cresteds will bark and behave like miniature guard dogs. If you want a quieter breed, look elsewhere.Chinese Cresteds are companion dogs and prefer to be with their owners and families. They cannot be left outside alone and will climb and dig to escape confinement if separated from their owners. They can also suffer from separation anxiety, which may make them destructive when they're left alone for too long.Proper socialization is necessary for the Chinese Crested since they can become timid and fearful of people.Chinese Cresteds are relatively clean and are low- to nonshedders.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",The average height for a Chinese Crested is between 11 to 13 inches for both sexes. They generally weigh up to 12 pounds.,"Alert and happy, the Crested adores and dotes on his people. Expect kisses and lots of snuggle time in your lap from this happy, loving little guy. Understand that he doesn't accept strangers easily — but once he comes to love you, you become his world.He makes an excellent companion and is extremely intelligent. Be aware, however, that many dog trainers unfairly rate them low on the intelligence scale because they don't fit the typical dog personality profile. The Crested is not a good breed for insensitive trainers.The Chinese Crested can be stubborn. Intensely social, he bonds tightly to his immediate pack. Really friendly Cresteds are the exception rather than the rule, as most are naturally suspicious of strangers. He can be reactive, and that trait combined with his high social drive tends to make him needy. He's wonderful with familiar people but likely to bite strangers unless socialized and trained out of that impulse.He'll alert bark to protect his home (not that the burglar is going to be terrified). He isn't particularly yappy, but he is adamant about his guard duty and will do his job. Some also like to howl or sing.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Crested needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Crested puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Cresteds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Cresteds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Cresteds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Dental Issues: These tend to crop up due to a genetic link that exists between dominant hairlessness and missing teeth. The Hairless Crested has small, peglike teeth that can slope toward the front of the mouth and cause problems; the Powderpuff has normal toy breed dentition. The Hairless often lose many teeth by the tender age of two or three. Some Hairless require canned food, while others eat kibble with no problem, as does the Powderpuff.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This condition involves the hip joint. If your Crested has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca: Known as ""dry eye,"" it's exactly what the name implies: an inflammation and dry eye. It occurs when there's a deficiency in the water portion of the tear film. The eye becomes dry and the membranes are left with only oil and mucus. The symptoms can be mistaken for conjunctivitis, which also has a gooey yellow discharge. Diagnosis is done with a Schirmer Tear Test. Treatment usually consists of eyedrops and ointment.","A Chinese Crested needs only minimal exercise — he is not a good jogging companion — but mental stimulation is important. There are many toys and puzzles designed for dogs on the market, and he can enjoy many of them.Chinese Cresteds are generally easy to train but they have a stubborn streak, which means you need patience. Positive reinforcement is the only route, and correction needs to be handled sensitively, because the breed can be naturally timid.Socialization is necessary, so if possible find a place that offers separate small-dog puppy classes, so your Crested can socialize with similarly sized dogs. He could be injured while playing with a larger puppy.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Crested doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Crested accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Chinese Crested in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. He's a people dog, and he isn't meant to spend his life locked up in a crate or kennel.Crate training is also helpful for housetraining, which can be one difficult area of training for the Chinese Crested (as a group, toy breeds can be tough to housetrain) — but it will all click into place eventually.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Crested in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Crested, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Powderpuff coats are seen in all colors and in combinations of mahogany, blue, lavender, or copper. They can be solid or spotted. The skin tones of the Hairless are pink and black. Perhaps it's the Hairless's essential nakedness that made stripper Gypsy Rose Lee a breeder.The Hairless Chinese Crested is bald except for soft, flowing hair on the head, feet, and tail. Hair on the body should be shaved to protect the skin. Don't use sun block or moisturizers; let the skin remain natural. The Hairless should be bathed frequently with a high-quality shampoo. Because he can be prone to minor skin problems, such as acne, check for any blackheads while grooming.Powderpuff Cresteds are a lot of work to groom. They have a silky double coat, and the undercoat is copious and will mat if the dog isn't groomed regularly. Shaving the face is an option. The Powderpuff needs to be brushed weekly, except when the puppy hair is changing into adult hair, during which brushing is best done on a daily basis. A pin or bristle brush is best. All mats should be worked out and any ""felting"" between the pads on the feet should be removed.Powderpuffs should be bathed regularly but not as frequently as the Hairless, and they need a high-quality shampoo to avoid stripping necessary oils from the hair and skin. The dog should be towelled off and blow-dried (on a very low temperature) to prevent him from getting chilled or his coat from getting over dried.Start grooming your Crested at a young age. Grooming allows you the opportunity to bond with your puppy as well as check for any signs of illness that your dog may be showing. Make grooming a positive experience and you will find that veterinary checkups and grooming sessions when the dog has reached maturity will be easy and enjoyable tasks.Most grooming services are available at the local pet groomer's, and if you're unsure or wary about doing any of it yourself, especially shaving, you should seek the help of a professional.Both varieties can have dental issues, but the Hairless is particularly prone. Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Crested to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Sweet, gentle children are adored by Chinese Crested. Children need to be old enough to understand that they must be careful with these small dogs.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Cresteds love other pets and are playful with them.","Chinese Cresteds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Chinese Cresteds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

Today he is primarily a companion, though he retains fighting toughness. He can be aggressive toward other dogs or people, so it's imperative that he be socialized and trained from an early age.Due to his short nose, the Shar-Pei is prone to overheating. Keep him inside with fans or air conditioning during hot summer months. Like other short-nosed breeds, he tends to snore and wheeze, and makes a terrible jogger.Like the Chow, the Shar-Pei has a dark tongue. This is considered normal, even desirable, by dog show enthusiasts.Frequent bathing isn't necessary for the Shar-Pei, but when you do bathe him, dry him thoroughly. The wrinkles and skin folds are an ideal breeding ground for fungal infections.Though devoted to his family, the Shar-Pei can be willful and stubborn. He must learn right away who the pack leader is or he's likely to compete for the job.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males and females stand 18 to 20 inches tall and weigh 40 to 55 pounds.,"The Shar-Pei is an alert and independent dog. He is extremely devoted to his family, but aloof with people he doesn't know. He is said to enjoy the companionship of people more than dogs, and he likes to be with his owner all the time. A calm and confident dog, he seems to develop an intuitive understanding of his owner or family.As devoted as he is, the Shar-Pei is also independent and strong willed. He is protective of his family — making for an excellent guard dog — and will respond to threats. Because he once was used as a pit-fighting dog, he can be aggressive toward other canines.Like every dog, the Shar-Pei needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences.

Not all Shar-Peis will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Shar-Pei Fever: Also known as swollen hock syndrome, this condition manifests in the swelling of the hock joint (sometimes both joints), and results in reluctance to move, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and shallow breathing. Dogs have one or more bouts of unexplained fever with temperatures as high as 103 to 107 degrees. The condition usually starts at 18 months, but can appear when the dog is an adult. The fever lasts 24 to 36 hours, and treatment includes reducing fever and pain.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Cancer: Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, is also a degenerative disease. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Demodectic Mange: Also known as demodicosis, this is caused by the demodex mite, which a mother dog passes to her pups in their first few days of life. (The mite can't be passed to humans or to other dogs; only by mother to pups.) Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause problems, but if your Shar-Pei has a weakened or compromised immune system, he can develop demodectic mange. In its localized form, patches of red, scaly, balding skin appear on the head, neck and forelegs. It often clears up on its own, but even so, you should take your dog to the vet to prevent it from turning into the generalized form of demodectic mange, which covers the entire body and causes infection.Seborrhea: This is a condition characterized by flaky skin and a rancid odor. It is usually a secondary condition to allergy, infection, or other disease. Treatment includes bathing in medicated shampoo and treating the underlying disease.Pyoderma: Another skin condition, this is a bacterial infection of the skin, and is fairly common in the Shar-Pei. It can be a primary or secondary infection; the latter results from an underlying condition such as allergy or hypothyroidism. Pyoderma is treated with antibiotics.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.Cutaneous Mucinosis: Mucin is the substance in the skin that causes wrinkling. Clear and stringy, it acts like glue when a dog is wounded. Some Shar-Peis have an excess of mucin, however, which causes it to form clear bubbles on the skin that may rupture and ooze. It may be associated with allergies and is treated with steroid therapy.Glaucoma: Glaucoma is defined by an increased pressure in the eye, and can be found in two forms: primary, which is hereditary, and secondary, which is caused by decreased fluid in the eye due to other eye diseases. Symptoms include vision loss and pain, and treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type. Glaucoma is treated surgically or with eye drops.Entropion: This is the inward rolling of the eyelid, usually the lower one, and found in both eyes. It causes vision loss and irritation, and generally occurs before a dog turns a year old. Corrective surgery when the dog reaches adulthood is an effective treatment.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Shar-Peis, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","The Shar-Pei lives comfortably in the city or country. He does well in a limited space, such as an apartment or condo, as long as he gets daily exercise. A backyard is not required, but he does appreciate getting out and stretching his legs. In general, the Shar-Pei is fairly happy just hanging out with his owner, wherever he may be.Begin training and socializing your Sharpei the day you bring him home, and commit to continuing the process all his life. He'll need the constant reinforcement since he's not naturally friendly to other dogs. He can also be stubborn and owners must be consistent and firm in order to establish leadership. He is generally eager to please, though, and responsive to training.The best kind of socialization exercise is to take your Shar-Pei with you everywhere — to puppy classes, outdoor events, busy parks, friends' homes — and as often as possible. This will help prevent him from becoming overly shy or overprotective. Since this breed can be aggressive toward other dogs, the Shar-Pei should be kept leashed in public.The Shar-Pei is classified as a short-nosed, or brachycephalic breed, similar to the Bulldog, Boxer, Pug. Their short noses make them highly sensitive to heat, which means they make lousy jogging companions. To prevent heat stroke, these dogs should be kept inside with fans or air conditioning in hot weather.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Shar-Pei, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","A quintessential Shar-Pei characteristic second only to his wrinkles is his bristly coat. It stands straight up, like a 1950s butch-style hairdo, and varies in length, from a really short ""horse"" coat to a longer ""brush"" coat. You can find it in many colors, including solid black, cream, fawn, red, sable, and blue. He sheds minimally.While the Shar-Pei is a naturally clean dog with very little odor, he needs only a little grooming to keep him looking good. A thorough brushing once a week with a rubber curry or grooming mitt is sufficient to remove dead hair and dirt. He doesn't need to be bathed a lot, about every 12 weeks if he hasn't been rolling in the mud. Frequent baths tend to irritate his skin.Brushing and bathing are the easy parts of grooming the Shar-Pei. The difficult, but essential, part is getting him dry after a bath. If you don't dry the folds and wrinkles completely, you can expect a yeast or fungal infection. Wipe thoroughly between the folds with a dry towel to eliminate all moisture.Brush your Shar-Pei's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections.Be especially careful with the Shar-Pei's ears: the canals are small and are prone to irritation and infection. Do not use a swab to clean the ears and take care not to get water in them when bathing. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin getting your Shar-Pei used to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Shar-Pei is a devoted family dog who is protective of his family, including children. To best teach him to get along with kids, he should be raised with them; if he doesn't live with them, he should be exposed to children as he grows up. Because he is such an independent breed, he's best suited to families with children 10 and older who know how to treat a pet respectfully.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.In order to provide the best chances for getting along with other dogs and animals, the Shar-Pei should be raised with them from an early age. Since he tends to be aggressive with other canines, supervision is essential.","Shar-Peis are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Shar-Peis in need of adoption and or fostering, so consider contacting a rescue group before going to a breeder.Chinese Shar-Pei Club of America National Rescue Trust","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Chinese Shar-Pei.Chinese Shar-Pei Club of America, Inc."
Chinook,3,4,1,5,1,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,3,5,1,2,4,3,4,3,4,5,3,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,Working Dogs,"1 foot, 9 inches to 2 feet, 3 inches tall at the shoulder",55 to 70 pounds,12 to 15 years,"Chinooks have a gentle, even temperament and are rarely shy or aggressive.Chinooks should live indoors with their people, preferably in a home where they have access to a safely fenced yard.Chinooks can be diggers.Chinooks need 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise. They enjoy hiking, jogging, and pulling, whether what's behind them is a sled, wagon, or person on skis or skates.Chinooks are smart and learn quickly, but if you're not consistent in what you ask of them, they'll take advantage of you.Chinooks are not barkers but can be talkative, whining and ""woo-wooing"" to express their opinions.Chinooks have thick coats and shed heavily twice a year; the rest of the year they shed small amounts daily.Chinooks need daily brushing to keep their coats clean, but baths are rarely necessary.Chinooks love kids when they're raised with them, but can be reserved with them otherwise.Never buy a Chinook from a puppy broker or pet store. Reputable breeders do not sell to middlemen or retailers, and there are no guarantees as to whether the puppy had healthy parents. Reputable breeders perform various health tests to ensure that their breeding dogs don't pass on a predisposition to genetic diseases.Interview breeders thoroughly, and make sure the puppy's parents have been screened for genetic diseases pertinent to that breed. Ask breeders about the health issues they've encountered in their dogs, and don't believe a breeder who claims that her dogs never have any health problems. Ask for references so you can contact other puppy buyers to see if they're happy with their Chinook. Doing your homework may save you a lot of heartbreak later.",Males stand 23 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh an average of 70 pounds. Females stand 21 to 25 inches at the shoulder and weigh an average of 55 pounds.,"The Chinook's temperament is described as calm, eager to please, and friendly. That said, he's not necessarily a hail fellow well met kind of dog. He can be dignified and reserved with people he doesn't know. Females are more likely than males to be independent thinkers.As with every dog, Chinooks need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Another way to help him polish his social skills is to invite visitors over regularly, and take him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors.","Chinooks are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Chinooks will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Chinooks, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or PennHIP for hips, as well as certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old. Health problems seen in this breed include hip dysplasia, cataracts, seizures, skin and coat problems, and gastrointestinal issues.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint, potentially causing pain and lameness in one or both rear legs. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. Cataracts usually, but not always, occur in old age and can sometimes be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Seizures: Chinooks have been known to suffer different types of seizures, and research on the problem is being conducted at the University of Missouri School of Veterinary Medicine. Seizures, which often don't begin until late in life, can sometimes be controlled with medication, but they cannot be cured. Chinooks who have seizures should not be bred.Skin and coat: Some Chinooks can develop dry, itchy skin or hot spots.Gastrointestinal issues: Some Chinooks may develop chronic gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, constipation, or vomiting.","Chinooks love their people and won't be happy living outdoors away from them. They're adaptable to most homes as long as their exercise needs are met.These active dogs need half an hour to an hour of daily exercise in the form of long walks and opportunities to run in large, safely enclosed areas. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended for this breed since Chinooks are so determined to get where they want to they'll ignore any shocks.Train the intelligent and sensitive Chinook with positive reinforcement techniques. He'll learn quickly if you're consistent in your expectations. Even more ideal is to work with a trainer to learn how to redirect unwanted behaviors and reward the behaviors you like.Housetraining shouldn't be a problem as long as you make it a positive experience and provide your pup with a regular potty schedule and plenty of opportunities to go outside. Crate training is a wonderful tool for housetraining and keeping your young puppy from chewing things he shouldn't.","Recommended daily amount: 3 1/8 to 4 5/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Chinook in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Chinook, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The double-coated Chinook has medium length hair with a thick, soft undercoat and a coarse outer coat. Chinooks who live in warm climates tend to have coats that are less dense than those of Chinooks in colder environments.The Chinook's tawny coat ranges from light honey to reddish-gold. The dogs may have black markings on the inside corners of the eyes and dark tawny to black markings on the ears and muzzle. Outer hairs on the tail are sometimes black. Some Chinooks have buff markings on the cheeks, muzzle, throat, chest, breeches, toes, and belly.Daily brushing keeps the Chinook clean and the shedding under control. Be sure to brush all the way down to the skin. The Chinook rarely needs more than a bath or two a year.Trim the thick, fast-growing nails weekly, and brush the teeth at least two or three times a week. Daily is better if you want to prevent periodontal disease and bad breath.Grooming provides you with an excellent opportunity to bond with your dog and to check his overall health. As you brush the coat or teeth, clean his ears and look for sores or other signs of irritation such as redness on the skin, mouth, feet, and ears. Eyes should be free of redness or discharge.Begin getting your Chinook used to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","A gentle and friendly Chinook can be a kid's best friend if they're brought up together. If your Chinook hasn't been socialized with kids, introduce the two slowly and calmly so the Chinook can become accustomed to the child at his own speed.Regardless, always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Because he was created to be a sled dog, the Chinook is a good team worker and usually gets along with other animals, cats included, but early socialization to other pets is still important. Males who haven't been neutered may be aggressive toward other males, especially unneutered males.","Sometimes Chinooks are acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

Their small size means they may require more frequent potty breaks. If you are person on the go, this pup would love to be your co-pilot.Their sharp, pointed ears mean they do not suffer the same propensity for ear infections as dogs with ears that are flappy. That said, ears should be checked regularly for mites, wax, and debris.Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking loudly against the floor. Your groomer can help with this, and YouTube tutorials can give you a refresher.Your main concern when it comes to your Chipin's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues.

Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.",The Chow Chow stands 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder and weighs 40 to 70 pounds.,"Some compare the Chow Chow's disposition to that of a cat: aloof, reserved, independent, dignified, intelligent, and stubborn.Despite his scowl, a good Chow should never be aggressive or shy. Chows tend to mind their own business and don't usually start trouble. They'll play with their people, but strangers are of no interest to them unless they're approaching the Chow's home without invitation from his owner — in which case he'll challenge the trespasser. He will, however, let strangers touch him if introduced by one of his owners.A Chow Chow must be extensively socialized — introduced to new people, dogs, and situations — as a puppy if he's going to be safe and relaxed as an adult.","Chow Chows are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can get certain health conditions. Not all Chows will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Chows, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.The following problems aren't common in the breed, but they may occur:Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD) is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Entropion causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Chow Chow has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically.","Chows can adapt to a variety of homes, from palaces to apartments. But they should always live indoors with their people, not stuck out in a backyard or kennel. They don't tolerate heat well, so keep them indoors when the weather is sweltering.Like any dog, an adult Chow Chow needs daily exercise to stay healthy and happy, but not much — he'll be satisfied with a couple of 15-minute walks daily or one longer walk.A Chow Chow is a homebody who's not prone to wandering, but you'll still want a secure fence if you've got a yard; it will protect him from traffic and prevent strangers from approaching him when you're not around to supervise.Chows are easily housetrained, but crate training is strongly recommended. Crates make housetraining easier and keep your Chow from chewing things while you're away. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don't keep your Chow locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Chow is with you.Chows are more than capable of learning anything you can teach, and a verbal correction is usually all that's required to set them straight. No dog should ever be hit, but it's especially counterproductive with this breed. The fiercely proud and independent Chow will never respond to physical abuse. Earn his respect in puppyhood with firm consistency, and you won't have any problem training him. But if you let the cute pup have his way all the time and then try to train him, you're sure to face problems.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2 3/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Chow in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Chow, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Chows can have two coat types, rough and smooth. The rough coat, which is what most people are used to seeing, is thick and abundant, standing off from the body like a parka. Beneath that outer coat lies a soft, thick, woolly undercoat. The hair is thicker around the head and neck, forming a ruff, or mane. The tail, which lies over the back, is also thickly furred.The smooth coated Chow Chow has a hard, dense, smooth outer coat with no obvious ruff or feathering (longer hair on the ears, legs, tail, or body).In both types, the coat comes in five colors: red (which can range from light golden to deep mahogany) black, blue, cinnamon (light fawn to deep cinnamon) and cream. These colors may be solid or solid with lighter shadings in the ruff, tail, and feathering.If you're buying a puppy, don't be roped into paying more for so-called rare or exotic colors. Some breeders describe their dogs' colors as champagne, silver, lilac, chocolate, or white, but these are just fancy names for the regular colors. There's no need to pay a premium for them, and reputable breeders won't try to charge one.Expect to brush your Chow Chow three times a week to keep the coat in good condition and to keep loose hair from landing on your clothes and furniture. Chow Chows are heavy seasonal shedders, and the coat requires extra attention at that time. They have no doggie odor if the coat is brushed often.For brushing, you'll need a stainless steel Greyhound comb with medium-coarse teeth; a medium-size slicker brush for the legs; a medium pin brush for the longer body coat; and a spray bottle of diluted coat conditioner for misting the coat as you brush. Never brush a dry coat or the hair will break. Brush all the way down to the skin or you're likely to miss mats and tangles.You'll probably want to bathe your Chow at least monthly — more often if he plays outside frequently and gets dirty.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Chow's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails as needed, maybe once or twice a month. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent painful, bloody tears.Start grooming your Chow when he's a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy vet exams and other handling when he's an adult.","When they're raised with children, Chow Chows can do well with them, but they're not a rough and tumble dog that will tolerate a lot of abuse from a young child. Chows do best in families with older children who understand how to treat a dog.As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your Chow, and supervise all interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party.Chows who are socialized and trained well can get along with other dogs and cats, especially if they're introduced to them in puppyhood. They do best, however, with dogs of the opposite sex; they may fight with dogs of the same sex.","Chow Chows are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Chows end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you're interested in adopting an adult Chow Chow who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Adopt-A-Chow RescueChow Chows to the RescueChow Dog Rescue","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Chow Chow.Chow Chow Club, Inc."

Make sure to stick to an appropriate diet and feeding schedule.Chugs tend to be ""yappy"" which can help them be good watchdogs. With early training, you can curb unwanted barking, however.Most owners say their Chugs have goofball personalities and like to act silly. A Chug will be great at making you smile.As a mostly brachycephalic (short-snouted) dog, Chugs can be prone to heat stroke. Take extra care of them in hot weather.Chugs also have shorter fur, so they may need the added protection of a jacket in cold weather.The main colors of Chugs are brown, black, fawn, cream, and white. Their coats can be solid colors or a mix of colors.","As the Chug is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Chihuahua and Pug parents, you can expect Chugs to be on the small side.Most Chugs weigh in around ten to 20 pounds, and they can be between ten to 14 inches tall.","The Chihuahua is known for its feisty but loyal attitude. The Pug is known for being a goofy and playful pup. Your Chug's personality can be a mix of any or all of these traits. Some people report that their Chugs are extra cuddly and playful, while others say their Chug has a comedic Napoleon Complex and can sometimes get territorial.Both the Pug and the Chihuahua are somewhat prone to barking or being ""yappy,"" which means that your Chug can be, too. If you are looking for a watch dog who will alert you any time someone is at the door, you can't do better than a Chug! With proper training, your Chug can learn how to curb their yappy tendencies.Like their Chihuahua parent, the Chug can sometimes get attached to one particular human member of the family. They may become territorial and guard this person if they feel threatened. Fortunately, there are ways to curb resource guarding and this type of behavior in general.Chugs can also be incredibly silly dogs. Many Chug owners refer to their pups as goofballs who love to play, run around, and get lots of cuddles.","The Chug breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chihuahua and Pug also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Chugs suffer from include:Respiratory problemsEye issues, like cataracts and cherry eyeHeat stroke","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Chug's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Chugs are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Chug's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds--especially the Pug and the Chihuahua--are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Chug diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. Like their parents, a Chug can be prone to excessive weight gain if overfed. Stick to a regular feeding schedule and do not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Chug's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Chug's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Chug coats are often a mix of their Dachshund and Chihuahua parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Chugs are brown, black, fawn, cream, and white.Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors. Their coats can be short and coarse, like short-haired Chihuahua and Pugs, or it can be softer, like long-haired Chihuahuas. Chugs are not recommended for those who suffer from dog allergies. Regular weekly brushing and grooming can help keep shedding to a minimum.No matter the type of coat, Chugs are not made for extreme weather. If you live in a colder area, they will need coats or sweaters when going outside. Likewise, they should not be kept outside in extreme heat, especially if they have a short snout.","Because the Chug is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Chugs prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Chug can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, Chugs can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. That said, Chugs, like their Chihuahua parent, might not be naturally fond of other animals and may prefer to be the sole animal of the house.This doesn't mean that a Chug can't get along with other dogs, cats, or smaller children. Like with any dog, training, socialization, and genetic disposition all play critical roles in a dog's personality.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Chugs because they are a mixed breed.

Expect to spend time on a waiting list.Clumber Spaniels can be destructive whether through boredom or play. Their strong jaws allow them to demolish many household items with ease and they can destroy many so-called indestructible toys. It is important to take this into consideration before purchasing a Clumber and to take the time to dogproof your house.Clumber Spaniels are notorious counter surfers. They may be short, but their long bodies enable them to reach even the deepest of counter spaces.Clumbers can figure out how to break into refrigerators, cupboards, and drawers.Clumber Spaniels are not for neat freaks. They are heavy shedders and require daily grooming to keep their coats healthy and free of dead hair. Even then, you will find their hair in every part of the house.Clumbers slobber.Clumber Spaniels are an excellent breed for first-time dog owners. They are generally an easy breed to care for and are only moderately stubborn. They have a sweet temperament, and their intelligence makes them a wonderful companion.Clumber Spaniels need 20 to 30 minutes of exercise daily, broken up into two or three short walks or a single walk.It is very important to maintain your Clumber Spaniel at a healthy weight to avoid stress on his joints. The breed has a high incidence of hip dysplasia and can become obese very easily.Clumber Spaniels do very well in apartments if their exercise needs are met.Clumber Spaniels generally do very well with children and other dogs and animals, but it is still important to properly socialize your puppy to prevent timidity.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Male Clumbers stand 18 to 20 inches at the shoulder and weigh 70 to 85 pounds; females are 17 to 19 inches and weigh 55 to 70 pounds.,"The Clumber personality ranges from reserved and dignified to ""I love everyone."" In the field they are quiet workers, and you will find them to be quiet at home as well. They will alert you to danger but aren't indiscriminate barkers.Although they have a reputation for being sweet and gentle, they can also be determined and self-willed. Spaniels like to get their way. And adolescent male Clumbers can be hooligans. They can become pushy and possessive if you don't establish your leadership early on. Be kind but firm with them, never harsh. That will only make them dig in their paws. Instead, establish clear rules and enforce them so your Clumber knows what you expect.Clumbers can develop bad habits such as counter surfing, fridge raiding, and chewing; in fact, they're sometimes referred to as Scavenger Spaniels. They'll steal food from little kids — they probably originated that saying about taking candy from a baby — so crate them while your child is eating. Remember, if they can reach a kitchen counter, they can reach your child's high chair.Correct these behaviors early — even if they make you laugh — before they become ingrained. Keep food and trash well out of reach, and put child locks on cabinets to keep your Clumber from breaking into the pantry. When you see him chewing on something he shouldn't, calmly take it away and replace it with a sturdy chew toy.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Clumber needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Clumber puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Clumbers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Clumbers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Clumbers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as letting a puppy gain too much weight too quickly or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. Because of the breed's short stature, Clumber hips do not look normal compared to those of other breeds, so a veterinarian looking at their hip x-rays must take that into account. That said, Clumbers have a high incidence of hip dysplasia, so it's essential for them to maintain a healthy weight to avoid stressing their joints. Your Clumber is highly likely to have hip dysplasia, but if you don't let him get overweight it probably won't cause any serious problems. Chondroitin sulfate/glucosamine supplements can be useful in managing any discomfort from hip dysplasia.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog's fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life.Ectropion: This defect is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, usually the lower one, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritation and infections such as conjunctivitis. Severe cases can be treated with surgery.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Clumber has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically, but wait until your Clumber is fully grown. Once his head finishes developing, at two to three years of age, the condition may correct on its own.Ear infections: Clumber Spaniels can be prone to ear infections because their floppy ears trap moisture. The warm, moist environment inside the ear is ideal for bacterial growth. Check ears regularly for signs of infection such as a bad odor, redness, or tenderness. The Clumber with an ear infection may also shake his head frequently or paw at it. Take him to your veterinarian for a diagnosis. Clumbers with frequent ear infections may have food allergies.","Clumber Spaniels can do well in apartments or condos if their low to moderate exercise requirements of a 20- to 30-minute daily walk or playtime are met.That said, don't forget that they're essentially a large dog. If you live in a fifth-floor walkup, will you be able to carry your adult Clumber up and down the stairs when he gets sick or too old to climb them? It's something to think about.Generally, Clumbers are quiet and are not known as a breed that barks a lot. A fenced yard keeps them safe from loss or theft.Besides walks, Clumbers enjoy playing fetch. When they're puppies, however, it's important to restrict any running on hard surfaces or jumping on and off furniture or sliding around on slick floors and crashing into the wall. All of those activities can injure their still-developing joints. Your Clumber pup will chase a ball for as long as you'll let him, even if he's tired, so it's up to you to limit his activity. Give him a break after the fifth fetch or so. Crate training is a wonderful tool to help in house training, and a crate also provides a safe haven for your Clumber Spaniel when you are gone. Clumbers are known for their ability to get into things, even as adults, so this ensures that both your dog and your belongings are safe when you are away.Some Clumbers are prone to colitis, inflammation of the large bowel. If your Clumber has soft stools that contain spots of blood or mucus but otherwise appears healthy, he may have colitis.Put him on a 24-hour fast, make sure he has access to plenty of water, then give him bland meals such as chicken and rice for the next couple of days. Gradually reintroduce his normal diet. If colitis recurs frequently, ask your veterinarian about giving your Clumber a diet formulated for dogs with sensitive digestive systems.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Puppies may eat as much as 4 to 6 cups a day.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can't feel the ribs, he needs less food and a longer walk.For more on feeding your Clumber, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Clumber Spaniel has a soft, medium-length coat that's thick and straight, lying flat on the body. The ears, legs, and belly have moderate feathering — a longer fringe of hair — and there's a frill below the neck, longer hair that's sometimes referred to as an apron. Clumbers are easy to prepare for the show ring because they're supposed to look natural, with no shaving or trimming except to tidy the feet, rear legs, and tail.Their bodies are primarily white, usually with lemon or orange markings around the eyes and on the head or ears. Sometimes they have freckles on their muzzle — the area of the head in front of the eyes — and on the legs, body, and at the base of the tail. Clumbers who will be show dogs should have as few markings on the body as possible, but freckles and markings on the body don't affect their ability to be a family friend.Clumber Spaniels are considered to be average to heavy shedders, and there will be days when it seems as if it's snowing Clumber hair in your home. Daily brushing is a must to keep loose hair to a minimum. Other than that, all you really need to do is trim the hair on their rear legs and tail and between the pads of the feet to keep them looking neat. Ask a breeder or groomer to show you how.A Clumber Spaniel's white coat can hold a significant amount of dirt and debris, so feel free to bathe him as often as you think necessary. As long as you're using a shampoo made for dogs, regular baths won't affect his coat except to make it look clean instead of dingy. Just be sure to rinse thoroughly to prevent itchiness from shampoo residue.Begin accustoming your Clumber to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.The Clumber Spaniel is prone to ear infections, so preventive care is important. This can be as simple as drying your dog's ears after swimming and checking the ears regularly for signs of infection such as a bad smell, redness, or tenderness.The Clumber with an ear infection may also shake his head frequently or scratch at his ears. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it.Brush your Clumber's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Clumber enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.","It's been said that Clumbers and kids go together like ice cream and cake. Clumbers generally love kids, especially kids who throw a ball for them to fetch. They are usually protective of children in the family and are more likely to walk away than to snap or growl if they're getting unwanted attention from a child.If your Clumber puppy is raised with your toddler, you'll probably see a beautiful friendship blossom. The toddler may accidentally get flattened once in a while by an exuberant young Clumber, but he'll be licked until he's back on his feet.Nonetheless, dogs are individuals, just like people. Not every Clumber who is raised with kids will take to them, especially if the kids are poorly behaved. Adult Clumbers who haven't been brought up with kids may do best in families with older children who understand how to interact with dogs.Some Clumbers may be reticent around children they don't know, and like most dogs, they don't like being charged by tiny toddlers — or anyone else. Protect your dog from these assaults, and teach the children you encounter how to approach a dog safely.Always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Clumber Spaniels also do very well with other dogs and animals, especially if they are raised with them. They are birdy, however, and you should protect pet birds until you're sure your Clumber understands they're off-limits.Some spaniels can learn that fact, if they're taught from puppyhood, but don't assume that it will happen with every dog. You may always need to keep the two separated, if only so your Clumber doesn't pull your parakeet's tail or your parrot won't take a bite out of your Clumber's sensitive nose.","Clumbers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Clumbers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Clumber rescue.Clumber Spaniel Club of America Rescue",not available
Cockapoo,4,4,5,4,3,4,4,5,5,4,5,4,2,1,1,3,2,3,2,3,4,4,2,3,2,3,3,3,3,5,Hybrid Dogs,"From 1 foot, 3 inches tall at the shoulder",Starts at 19 pounds,12 to 15 years,"The Cockapoo is not known to be a barker. Some, however, will bark when they see someone approaching their house, or when they're left alone for long periods at a time.The Cockapoo should be a nonshedding dog with little doggy odor to the skin and coat. He requires daily brushings and will need his hair trimmed and clipped occasionally.Cockapoos are usually good for people with allergies since they produce low amounts of dander and hair.Cockapoos were developed to be companion dogs and are usually friendly and extraordinarily happy. They can do well with other dogs, pets, and children; older, more considerate children are generally best, however.Although the Standard or Maxi Cockapoo doesn't adapt as readily to apartment life as his smaller cohorts do, he can do well if exercised properly. The ideal situation is a house with a small, fenced yard.The Cockapoo is so intelligent that he's easy to train with positive reinforcement.Cockapoos have a moderate energy level but still need daily exercise. Expect to give him at least 15 minutes per day and offer a variety of activities, such as games of fetch, walks, and good runs.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.There are many responsible Cockapoo breeders, and some are registered with either the Cockapoo Club of America or the North American Cockapoo Registry.Designer dogs, also called hybrids, aren't true breeds — they're crosses of two specific breeds. If you're interested in a Cockapoo puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren't as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don't know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog.","The Cockapoo is bred in four different size categories:The Teacup Toy is less than 6 pounds in weight and less than 10 inches in height.The Toy Cockapoo can reach 10 inches in height but has a sturdier build, the bigger ones tipping the scales at just under 12 pounds.The Miniature Cockapoo weighs 13 to 18 pounds and ranges between 11 and 14 inches high.The Standard or Maxi Cockapoo should weigh more than 19 pounds and be at least 15 inches in height.","Intelligent and easy to please, the Cockapoo was established as a companion dog. He's friendly and happy, happy, happy. He has an outgoing nature and usually gets along with everyone. Depending on his temperament, he can be active or he can simply enjoy snuggling up on the couch with you.He has the intelligence of his Poodle forebears but also the sweet disposition of his Cocker Spaniel ancestry. If the parents don't have the loving quality that is expected in a Cockapoo, then their offspring won't either.Like every dog, the Cockapoo needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Cockapoo puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.He prefers, always, to be with his family and can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for too long. He can be easy to train, though that's dependent on the parents' temperament. Positive reinforcement is the best way to train a Cockapoo; he can achieve high levels of obedience with time and patience.","The notion of hybrid vigor is worth understanding if you're looking for a Cockapoo. Hybrid vigor isn't necessarily characteristic of mixed breeds; it occurs when new blood is brought in from outside the usual breeding circle — it's the opposite of inbreeding.However, there is a general misconception that hybrid vigor automatically applies to mixed breeds. If the genetic pool for the mixed breed remains the same over time, the offspring won't have hybrid vigor. And if a purebred breeder brings in a dog from an unrelated line, those puppies will have hybrid vigor, even though they're purebred.Not all Cockapoos will get any or all of these diseases, butit's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Cockapoo is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Liver Disease: This condition is becoming more prevalent in Cocker Spaniels in two forms: chronic active hepatitis and copper toxicosis (poisoning). Both conditions may or may not be genetic; at this point no one is certain. More research is needed, but meanwhile ask your Cockapoo breeder about the parent Cocker's liver history.Ear Infections: These afflictions may plague the Cockapoo because of his floppy Cocker ears, which can trap moisture, dirt, and debris. The Cockapoo's ears should be regularly checked and cleaned. Ask your veterinarian about appropriate ear care products.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Cockapoos, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That's because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it's often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.","Most Cockapoos have a moderate level of energy, but that doesn't mean they'll laze around all day. They enjoy a good walk — and need it to keep them from becoming overweight. The best type of exercise, though, is a good play session in the backyard. Expect him to need at least 15 minutes of exercise every day.The Cockapoo is an adaptable breed. He can live in an apartment, though the smaller varieties seem to do better there than do the Maxi or Standard Cockapoos. None of them should live outdoors or in kennels, since they've been bred to be companion dogs. They thrive when with their family and can suffer from separation anxiety when left for long periods of time — and that can lead to excessive barking and to destructive behavior.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Cockapoo doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will also help your Cockapoo accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Don't stick your Cockapoo in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night (although he would much prefer your bed). Cockapoos are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 3/4 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Cockapoo in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Cockapoo, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Cockapoo has a single, long coat that can range from straight to loose curls, but it shouldn't be kinky. Cockapoos can be found in all the colors and color combinations that are seen in both Cocker Spaniels and Poodles — a more rich variety of coat colors than is usual in many other breeds.The Cockapoo is usually seen au naturel, but many people like to clip the coat. However, it should only be trimmed to two to three inches in length. Hair around the eyes should be trimmed to allow visibility, so he's not doing an impression of an Old English Sheepdog. The coat should be brushed daily.Although it's different for every Cockapoo, a puppy resulting from a multigenerational breeding is supposed to be odorless and nonshedding (although ""nonshedding"" is a fantasy, since every dog on the planet sheds at least a tiny bit). To retain coat oils and health, he only need be bathed when absolutely necessary.Because his floppy Cocker ears block air circulation, the ears must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. (Don't stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal, because that could damage it.) Your Cockapoo may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Cockapoo's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Cockapoo to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Cockapoo does well with youngsters, although he generally prefers homes with older, more considerate children. He also gets along with other dogs and pets.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.","Cockapoos are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

Don't be surprised if your Cocker exhibits submissive urination (peeing when excited).Cockers can be barkers, so response to a ""Quiet"" command should always be part of this dog's repertoire.The Cocker is eager to please and likes to be close to his family. But remember, he was bred to be a hunting dog. Don't be surprised when he chases birds or other small animals when you're out on a walk. Keep your Cocker on a leash whenever you aren't in a fenced area.The Cocker has a ""soft"" personality. Harsh training methods will make him fearful, so be sure to use gentle, consistent training to get the best results.A Cocker Spaniel's long ears are both a part of his beauty and a potential health problem. Be sure to check your Cocker's ears every week for infections.Keeping the Cocker coat beautiful is expensive and a lot of work. Plan on paying a professional groomer and on brushing the coat every day.To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.","Males stand 15 inches tall, females 14 inches tall. Males and females weigh 24 to 28 pounds.","The well-bred Cocker Spaniel has a sweet temperament. He is affectionate and cuddly and loves to participate in family activites. He is playful, alert, and active, enjoying any exercise from a brisk walk to hunting in the field.The Cocker is known to be a sensitive dog, mentally and physically. He has a ""soft"" personality and does not respond well to harsh treatment, sometimes turning to growling or snapping when he's in pain or afraid. Early socialization and training is essential to teach the Cocker appropriate canine manners. He needs to be handled carefully and kindly to bring out the best in his personality.","Cockers are generally healthy, but, like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain conditions and diseases.Eye problems can strike the Cocker in a number of ways, including progressive retinal atrophy, a degenerative disease of the retinal cells that progresses to blindness; cataracts, a cloudy film that forms over the eye;  glaucoma, a condition in which pressure builds up inside of the eyeball; and eye abnormalities. If you notice any redness in your Cocker's eyes, or if he starts rubbing his face a lot, take him to the vet for a checkup.Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a condition in which a dog's immune system attacks its own blood cells. Symptoms include pale gums, fatigue, and sometimes jaundice. A swollen abdomen is also indicative, since it signals an enlarged liver. Most affected Cockers do well with treatment, but they should not be bred.Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland that's thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It's treated with medication and diet.Primary seborrhea is a skin problem caused by overproduction of skin cells, including the sebaceous (oil) cells. The skin becomes greasy and scaly and has a foul odor. Treatments include medication and medicated baths.Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and Cockers can be especially prone to them. The three main types are food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Idiopathic epilepsy is often inherited and can cause mild or severe seizures. It's important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your dog has seizures, it's important to take him to the vet right away for a checkup.Canine hip dysplasia is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Patellar luxation  involves dislocation (luxation) of the kneecap (patella). In this condition the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling.","The Cocker Spaniel is well suited to living in an apartment or condo — though of course he loves to share a house and yard. Although he doesn't need vast space to roam, he does need daily activity. A daily romp in the yard along with a brisk 30-minute walk can keep him happy and trim. Then bring him inside with you — the Cocker is not pleased to be left alone outdoors for the day, and he may respond by digging or barking to keep himself amused. He's most content when he's with his family, participating in the group's activities.Despite his beautiful locks and cute, round eyes, the Cocker Spaniel is a hunter at heart. He is also a good candidate for many canine sports, especially agility and obedience competitions, hunt tests, flyball, or tracking. Like most dogs, the Cocker is better behaved when active than when he's allowed to get bored, which can lead to such behavior problems as barking, digging, and chewing.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a dayThe Cocker Spaniel has a hearty appetite, and he will overeat if given the chance. He's especially skilled at melting your resolve with his big, brown eyes as he begs for tidbits. But don't give in — an overweight Cocker is an unhealthy Cocker.For more on feeding your Cocker Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

His thick, sometimes wavy coat is short on the head and back and long on the ears, chest, belly, and legs. The coat is a solid color (black or light cream to red to brown), or parti-color (two or more colors, one of which is white).Grooming is an intense — and potentially expensive — proposition for the Cocker Spaniel. Most owners opt to have a professional groomer bathe, brush, and trim their dogs' coats every six to eight weeks, and prices are high for this time-intensive breed. Daily brushing at home is also necessary to keep the coat free of tangles and mats. If you are hesitant about a breed that requires substantial grooming, the Cocker is not for you.Some owners opt to clip the coat short to make care easier. Even so, trimming and bathing every six to eight weeks is necessary to keep the Cocker clean and the coat short.The Cocker Spaniel must be introduced to grooming early so he will grow up to accept it as a normal part of his life. Given his sensitive personality, an early introduction is advisable so that he learns to accept the handling, brushing, noise of electric clippers, scissoring, ear cleaning, and all the rest of the tasks involved in keeping him looking good.Unfortunately, the Cocker has a reputation with groomers (and veterinarians) as being less than cooperative. This touchy attitude usually stems from lack of training to accept handling. Positive, kind lessons on how to act on the grooming table or at the veterinarian's office are needed.The nails need to be trimmed once a month (or at grooming sessions), and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. The Cocker Spaniel is prone to ear infections, so it's essential to be vigilant. Wipe the ears out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.It also helps to use deep, narrow bowls to for the Cocker's food and water. This way he can eat and drink without getting his ears damp or soiled with food. Some owners even put a snood on the Cocker while he eats, for extra ear protection.","One of the reasons the Cocker Spaniel is so popular is that he makes a good family dog. He gets along well with children — as long as he is raised with them and the kids are kind and respectful to animals. But because he is a sensitive dog, all interactions between the Cocker and children should be supervised by a responsible adult.The Cocker Spaniel also gets along with other family pets (given proper training and introductions), including dogs, cats, and small animals.","Cocker Spaniels are often bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

However, if she is left alone too often or if she is bored, she will bark excessively.Both varieties need grooming, but the Rough Collie especially needs regular brushing to keep her coat clean and free of tangles.Many Collies are sensitive to medications including ivermectin, the drug used in heartworm preventives. Be sure to talk with your veterinarian before giving your Collie a heartworm preventive or any other drug.Be careful from whom you acquire a Collie. The Collie's popularity has given rise to unethical breeders acting with no regard for temperament, health, or conformation. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 24 to 26 inches tall; females are 22 to 24 inches tall. Collies weigh 50 to 70 pounds.,"The well-bred Collie is sweet, friendly, and gentle. She is a family dog and enjoys being part of all household activities. Especially fond of kids, she enjoys playing with them and protectively watching over them.If those qualities weren't positive enough, the Collie tops them with her intelligence and loyalty. This dog is smart and learns quickly.And her devotion? She would probably swim through shark-infested waters to save her owner (just like Lassie).Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Collie needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Collie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Collies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Collies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Collies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Dermatomyositis: An inherited autoimmune skin disorder, this malady causes lesions and muscle problems. Studies indicate that perhaps 70 percent of Collies (both Rough and Smooth) could be carriers. Research currently is being conducted to identify the genes that carry this disease.Collie Nose: Also known as nasal solar dermatitis, this is a condition in which the skin of nose peels, oozes, and may lose color. If left untreated, it can be painful or develop into cancer. Collie nose is managed by limiting exposure to sunlight, using sunscreen, or tattooing with black ink to protect against harmful rays.Collie Eye Anomaly: This inherited condition can sometimes lead to blindness. The condition causes changes and abnormalities in the eye. These changes can include choroidal hypoplasia, an abnormal development of the choroid (an inner coat of the eyeball); coloboma, a defect in the optic disc; staphyloma, a thinning of the sclera (the white outer coat of the eyeball); and retinal detachment. Collie eye anomaly usually occurs by the time the dog is two years old. There is no treatment for the condition.Progressive Retinal atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they also lose their daytime vision. Many dogs adapt well to limited or complete vision loss, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Nodular Granulomatous Episclerokeratitis (NGE): Also called nodular fascitis, fibrous histiocytoma, or Collie granuloma, this condition is thought to be an immune disorder. It eventually causes damage to the cornea. Many Collies with Collie nose also have NGE. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive medications.Hip Dysplasia: This is an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Allergies: Quite common is dogs, there are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Drug Sensitivity: The Collie is known to react to such drugs as ivermectin (found in heartworm control medication), anesthesia, and insecticides. Consult with your veterinarian before giving your Collie any medication or using flea or tick control products.","The Collie lives comfortably in the city or the country, as long as she has enough exercise. A brisk, daily walk and yard play are sufficient. Mostly, she wants to be with her family, meaning she is not a candidate for a backyard lifestyle.If left alone for too long, she tends to bark excessively. While some barking is normal in this herding breed — that's how she warned the shepherd of wolves — she will bark her head off when she's bored, lonely, or otherwise frustrated. Excessive barking can be avoided by letting the Collie join in all family activities, and by keeping her mentally challenged with ongoing obedience training or dog sports.Training the Collie is a breeze, but — like any dog — she needs early socialization to prevent her from becoming timid. She also benefits from obedience training; a ""Quiet"" command should be a part of every Collie's training program.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Collie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Collie has two coat types: Rough (long hair) and Smooth (short hair). The Rough Collie has an abundant, straight outer coat that is harsh to the touch, and a soft, furry undercoat that is so thick it's difficult to see the skin when you part the hair. The Smooth Collie has a short, dense, flat outer coat with a thick undercoat. Both varieties shed moderately.The Collie comes in four colors: sable (think Lassie), tricolor (black with white markings and tan shadings), blue merle (silvery blue and black), and white (predominately white with markings).The amount of grooming necessary for the Collie depends on the variety. Overall, the Collie is a clean dog, with minimal doggie odor. The long, full coat of the Rough Collie needs thorough brushing twice a week (even more frequently to keep her looking Lassie-like). Brushing once a week is sufficient for the Smooth Collie.Bathe as needed, usually every six to eight weeks. Many owners opt to pay a professional groomer to brush and bathe their Collie, especially the Rough variety, because the coat is so thick. Novice owners may find brushing challenging, though practice and instruction from a Collie breeder or skilled groomer can keep this from becoming a discouraging chore.Trim the Collie's nails once a month, and check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.Brush your Collie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Begin accustoming your Collie to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The playful Collie is known for her love of children, even those she wasn't raised with. She's highly protective of the kids in her family, watching over them and keeping them safe from danger, just like Lassie did for Timmy.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Collie is also protective of and gentle with other pets in her family. She's an affectionate, tender guardian, willing to watch over baby rabbits, chicks, or goats.","Collies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Collies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Collie rescue.The Collie Club of America","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Collie.Collie Club of America, Inc."

Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors, like a brindle or pied coat.Your Corgi Inu will definitely be a heavy shedder. Daily brushing is necessary for this very furry breed. Because of their fur, they are not ideal for people who suffer from dog allergies.Corgi Inus can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. However, if your dog is more Inu than Corgi, they may prefer to be the sole animal of the house.Even though the Corgi Inu is not a large dog, the breed tends to have quite a lot of energy. Corgi Inus are usually fairly intelligent, as well, so if you do not make time to make sure they have plenty of mental and physical stimulation, they could try to push boundaries.The Corgi Inu tends to stick to a few favorite family members, but can be outgoing towards others if properly socialized and trained.","As the Corgi Inu is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Corgi and Shiba Inu parents, you can expect Corgi Inus to be on the medium side.Most weigh in at 17 to 27 pounds and range in height from nine to 15 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger.","Corgi Inu personalities are interesting because they can be incredibly different between two dogs, even pups from the same litter. On one hand, you have the Corgi, who is an outgoing, goofy dog. On the other, you have the Shiba Inu, who is a little more reserved and not as eager to meet new folks. Your Corgi Inu can have a mix of these traits.Both parent breeds are excellent guard dogs, so many Corgi Inu owners report that their dogs are very vigilant and ready to alert any time someone approaches the home.Even though the Corgi Inu is not a large dog, the breed tends to have quite a lot of energy.

If you are looking for an energetic, protective pup with the goofiest grin on the planet, a Corgi Inu just might be the right breed for you.","The Corgi Inu breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Corgi and Shiba Inu also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Corgi Inus suffer from include:CataractsElbow and hip dysplasiaDegenerative Myelopathy","As with any dog, you should keep up with your Corgi Inu's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy and happy.Corgi Inus are somewhat prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not beclicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Corgi Inu's care will be maintaining their oral health, as both parent breeds are prone to periodontal disease. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth the correct way.","An ideal Corgi Inu diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy.They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Corgi Inu's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Corgi Inu's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Corgi Inu coats are often a mix of their Corgi and Shiba Inu parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Corgi Inus are red, black, blue, fawn, white, and sable.Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors, like a brindle or pied coat.They generally have long, dense coats. Shiba Inus have double coats, while Corgis have shorter, thick, waterproof coats. This means your Corgi Inu will definitely be a heavy shedder. Daily brushing is necessary for this very furry breed. Because of their fur, they are not ideal for people who suffer from dog allergies.Thanks to their heavy coats, Corgi Inus are suited very well for colder temperatures. When it comes to extreme heat, however, the Corgi Inu does not fair well. Of course, you shouldn't leave your dog out in any form of extreme weather, no matter their coat.","Corgi Inus can be great around children, as long as the kids are trained on how to properly interact with the dog. The mixed breed is a medium-sized dog, which means bigger kids--and adults--could potentially hurt the dog if they get too rowdy. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with animals, the Corgi Inu can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other animals, Corgi Inus may be a little hesitant to open up. Both the Shiba Inu and the Corgi have pretty strong prey drives, and they may attempt to chase smaller dogs, rodents, or cats.

He's an enthusiastic participant in agility and obedience competitions.The Coton is a hardy dog, but he's a companion breed who should live indoors. He's particularly well-suited to apartment living.Cotons enjoy playing and going for walks, but they adjust their activity to their people's level.Cotons require brushing several times a week to prevent mats and tangles from forming. Bathe them as needed, weekly or monthly.Coton puppies need extra grooming while their adult coats are coming in, usually between seven and 15 months of age.Never buy a Coton from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, who breeds for sound temperaments, and who has signed the breed club's code of ethics.",Male Cotons stand 10 to 12.5 inches at the shoulder and weigh 9 to 13 pounds; females are 8.5 to 11 inches and weigh 8 to 11 pounds.,"The happy and boisterous Coton is a people-pleaser, who wants nothing more than to spend time with his humans. He forms strong bonds with family members and doesn't like to be separated from them.He's smart and easy to train, responding well to praise, play, and food rewards. He'll play the clown for attention, which he loves. Cotons may bark once or twice if the doorbell rings or they see something interesting, but they don't generally bark just for the fun of it. Guests and intruders alike run the risk of being licked to death.Females are more independent than males and often rule over them.Like every dog, Cotons need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure your Coton puppy grows up to be a well-adjusted, happy dog.","The Coton is generally healthy. Following are some of the conditions that have been seen in Cotons, although they're not widespread in the breed.Luxating patellas, (knees that slip in and out of place) are a common problem in any small breed, and the Coton is no exception. It's important to protect puppies from jumping on and off furniture while their joints are still developing. Cotons think they're invincible, as well as capable of flight, so it's important to protect them from themselves.Hip Dysplasia (HD) is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness in one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it may sometimes be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a hereditary degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Reputable breeders provide health certifications for a puppy's parents. In Cotons, expect to see Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) certification for knees, hips, elbows, and hearts, as well as certification of eye health from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation.Some breeders may also provide OFA thyroid certifications. Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That's because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it's often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.","The Coton is a hardy dog who enjoys playing in all types of weather, including snow and rain. But he should always live indoors with his people (as should all dogs).He's well-suited to living in any environment, from apartments to ranch houses, but if he has a yard it should be fenced so he doesn't wander off — or get stolen away by someone who admires him as much as you do.Some people find the Coton difficult to housetrain, but given a regular schedule, frequent outings to do his business, and praise when he potties in the right place, a Coton can pick it up very quickly.Crate-training can help him learn to wait until he's taken outside to potty, as well prevent him from getting into trouble when you're not around to supervise.Cotons take well to training, especially when it's presented in a positive manner. Reward him with praise, play, and treats, and let him know what a great job he's done. Remember that his goal is to please you.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 cup daily of a high-quality dog food, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Coton, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Coton's coat is one of his distinguishing features. It's long, soft, and thick, with what can only be described as a fluffy, cottony texture. By adulthood, it's usually four inches long.The coat is white, although it may have a few shadings of light gray or red-roan (a mixture of white and fawn hairs) on the ears. Puppies are born all white or with yellow, brown, rust, or black spots on the head, ears, and sometimes the body. These spots disappear as puppies mature, leaving behind areas that range in color from light to medium champagne or gray.Cotons shed little, mainly in the spring. They're often recommended for people with allergies, but it's always wise to meet and spend time with a number of different Cotons before deciding you can actually live with one.To prevent matted fur, brush the coat three or four times a week with a pin brush that has uncoated metal pins. Pay special attention to the areas behind the ears, legs, and elbows. Using a spray conditioner as you brush will keep hair breakage to a minimum.The more often you brush, the less frequently you'll have to bathe him. A fine-toothed metal comb and a smaller comb for the face will also help keep your Coton looking sharp. If you want to see his eyes, use a coated hair elastic to create a cute topknot. You can also keep his coat in a short puppy clip for easier care.Depending on how dirty he gets, your Coton may need to be bathed weekly, every two weeks, or monthly. When bathing your Coton, you'll probably want to use a whitening shampoo to keep him looking his best. After a bath, pat him damp dry instead of rubbing him with a towel or his coat will knot up. Then you can brush the coat out as you blow him dry.The adult coat starts coming in between seven and 15 months of age, and during this time your Coton puppy will need additional grooming to prevent mats and tangles.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care.Brush your Coton's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar and bacterial buildup. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Coton jumps up to greet you.Begin getting your Coton accustomed to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Cotons are good with kids if kids are good with them. They're fun-loving and energetic enough to be playmates for older children who treat them respectfully, but they'll learn to hide from clumsy younger children who may pat them too hard or accidentally kick them or step on them.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child to never approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Cotons prefer the company of people, but they get along well with other Cotons, dogs of other breeds, and cats.

The coat requires only moderate grooming, and the breed sheds only twice a year.Curly-Coated Retrievers generally have an oily coat, which is more likely to cause reactions in people with allergies.Curly-Coated Retrievers are more reserved around strangers than other retriever breeds and needs to be properly socialized to avoid any timidity.Curly-Coated Retrievers are sporting dogs and have the energy that other sporting and working dogs have. If they are not given adequate exercise, at least 30 to 60 minutes per day, they can become quite destructive in their boredom.Curly-Coated Retrievers tend to be mouthy and will nip and chew everything in reach, including toys, clothes, and hands.The Curly-Coated Retriever is intelligent and enjoys working, but he needs a strong, confident owner who will keep him from taking charge. He also needs variety in training and activities because he tends to get bored doing the same old thing again and again.Curly-Coated Retrievers are more difficult to find than other breeds, but it is still important to look for the best possible breeder, even if long waiting lists await you.Curly-Coated Retrievers take longer to mature than other breeds, so be prepared for your dog to act puppylike for at least three years.In general, Curly-Coated Retrievers do well with children but small children should never be left unsupervised with any dog regardless of breed.Curly-Coated Retrievers are not meant for apartments and do better in homes with a large yard where they can expend their energy. They are quieter in homes when their energy levels are met.Although they enjoy the great outdoors, Curly-Coated Retrievers are not dogs who can be kenneled outside. They enjoy being with their family and can become very destructive when left away from them.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",A Curly-Coated male is 25 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 80 to 100 pounds; a female is 23 to 25 inches and weighs 65 to 85 pounds.,"The Curly-Coat is full of retriever drive and determination. He'll work 'til the job is done. In the field or at home, he's alert and self-confident. He has an even temper but is more reserved with strangers than other retrievers. Early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences — helps prevent timidity. That said, don't confuse his independence and poise with shyness or a lack of willingness to please. Curly-Coated Retrievers take longer to mature than other breeds, so be prepared to live with a full-grown puppy for several years.Curlies have a mind of their own and need a confident owner who won't allow them to run the show. The Curly-Coated Retriever responds well to training, although not always as quickly as other dogs. That doesn't mean he's dumb. He simply gets bored easily. Keep him interested with a variety of training exercises. It's not unusual for a Curly to ignore his trainer when an exercise or activity becomes repetitive.","Curly-Coated Retrievers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Curlies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Curlies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as letting a puppy gain too much weight too quickly or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, weight loss to reduce the pressure on the joints, or medication to control the pain.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Curly has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can and should be corrected surgically.Ectropion: This defect is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, usually the lower one, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritation and infections such as conjunctivitis. Severe cases can be treated with surgery.Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog's eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia.Persistent Pupillary Membranes (PPM): Persistent Pupillary Membranes are strands of tissue in the eye, remnants of the fetal membrane that nourished the lenses of the eyes before birth. They normally disappear by the time a puppy is 4 or 5 weeks old, but sometimes they persist. The strands can stretch from iris to iris, iris to lens, or cornea to iris, and sometimes they are found in the anterior (front) chamber of the eye. For many dogs, the strands do not cause any problems and generally they break down by 8 weeks of age. If the strands do not break down, they can lead to cataracts or cause corneal opacities. Eye drops prescribed by your veterinarian can help break them down.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Retinal Dysplasia: Retinal Dysplasia is most commonly a congenital hereditary disease, meaning the dog is born with it and it was passed to him by his parents, but it can also result from trauma or prenatal herpesvirus or parvovirus infections. It can be mild or severe and is caused by an abnormal development of the retina, resulting in retinal folds. This can lead to a variety of vision problems for the dog ranging from a small blind spot to total blindness. Retinal dysplasia can be detected as early as six to eight weeks of age. There is no known treatment for retinal dysplasia, but many blind dogs live full lives, and their other senses compensate for the vision impairment.Pattern Baldness: This gradual thinning of the hair follows one of three patterns. The first is more commonly found in females and the baldness occurs around the temples, on the chest, abdomen, back of the thighs, and under the neck. The second occurs more commonly in males and is the loss of hair on the ears. The third is also more commonly found in males and is the loss of hair on the back of the thighs, underneath the neck and on the tail. There is no treatment for Pattern Baldness.Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD): This metabolic disorder occurs when glycogen, a complex carbohydrate, is unable to be released and used by the body. This deficiency can lead to other disorders such as skeletal muscle disease and liver disease. Signs of Glycogen Storage Disease can be lethargy, collapse, exercise intolerance, and a prolonged recovery from exercise. A DNA test is now available to determine which dogs carry the recessive gene. Dogs that are carriers should not be bred, and they should absolutely never be bred to another carrier. It is important to ensure that your puppy's breeder has had her dogs cleared of this condition. There is also a registry of GSD cleared Curly-Coated Retrievers and you can view this at http://www.flairfor.com/GlycogenStorageDiseaseIIIa.htmlLymphosarcoma: Lymphosarcoma is the third most common cancer that affects dogs and can be found in various parts of the body such as the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow. The cancer is treated with chemotherapy and approximately 80 percent of dogs treated will go into remission.Adenocarcinoma: Adenocarcinoma is a growth of malignant cells and is one of the most common types of canine cancers. The cells usually originate in the uterus, mammary glands, and intestines. Often these cells spread to the lungs and other parts of the body, including the area around the anus. Nearly 80 percent of lung tumors are adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinoma is treated by removing the tumors and affected lymph nodes surgically and providing chemotherapy. Other treatments may be used depending on the area affected.Fibrosarcoma: This tumor is found in fibrous connective tissue and can affect any part of the body, including bone. It is the third most common type of bone cancer and can spread from the bone to the lungs, heart, lymph nodes, and kidneys. Treatment may involve one or all of the following: surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, photodynamic and hyperthermia therapy, radiation therapy, and in some cases amputation of a limb.Mast Cell Tumors: Also known as Mastocytoma, or Mast Cell Sarcoma, these are the most common skin tumors seen in dogs and are found in the loose connective tissue in the body. The tumors often form on the skin of the area around the anus, the legs, or the trunk of the dog but they can be found on the head and neck. Treatment varies and may involve surgery or chemotherapy.Hemangiosarcoma: This form of malignant cancer is found in the lining of blood vessels as well as the spleen.Melanoma: Melanoma is a cancer of the pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) of the skin. It is commonly found on the skin, but it can also be found on the inside of the mouth and gums. The malignant melanocytes spread from the skin lesions through the blood and lymph vessels. This can lead to other tumors and cause the death of the dog. Treatment is usually surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In the case of oral melanoma, a part of the jawbone may be surgically removed.Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don't suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss.Gastric dilatation-volvulus (Bloat): This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.","Curly-Coated Retrievers need a half hour to an hour a day of exercise and stimulation. One of the best ways to keep a Curly active and stimulated is to provide him with a variety of jobs, from walks to swimming to carrying light items for you. Puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes will keep Curlies entertained, as will training them for obedience, agility, and other dog activities.Curly-Coated Retrievers are rambunctious as puppies. Early training is a must, and it's a great way to bond with your active pup. Puppies have a high activity level, but they also need lots of naps to recharge, so the hard exercise you might give an adult isn't necessary for them.Curly-Coated Retrievers tend to be mouthy and will nip and chew everything they find. This can cause expensive veterinary bills if the puppy happens to eat something that could harm him.To keep your puppy safe and to help with housetraining, crate training is recommended. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Curly doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Curly accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Curly in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Curlies are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Curly, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Curly-Coated Retriever has a unique coat: a mass of small, crisp curls that lie close to the skin and cover the body from the tail all the way up to the top of the head. It's water- and weather-resistant and protects the skin from any rough brush the dog might run through as he hunts. The curls on the ears might be slightly looser than the curls on the body, and occasionally a Curly has feathering — a longer fringe of hair — on the ears, belly, thighs, feet, and back of the forelegs, but this is usually trimmed. If there is feathering on the tail, people with show dogs remove it, but it certainly doesn't affect a Curly's ability to be a great companion.On the forehead, face, feet, and front of the forelegs, the coat is short and straight. The hair has a dense, rough texture, never silky or dry and brittle. You definitely shouldn't see any bald patches.The color of the Curly-Coated Retriever is black or liver, described as a deep reddish-brown. You might see a few white hairs in the coat, but no large white patches.A Curly-Coated Retriever has a relatively easy-care coat and usually sheds only twice a year, although the amount of shedding varies among individual dogs. Preparation in puppyhood is key. As with all breeds, it's important to start grooming your Curly-Coated Retriever puppy when he's young. Make grooming a positive and soothing experience, and he'll be easier for you and other people to handle when he's grown.As you groom, take time to check your Curly's overall condition. Keep an eye out for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness or discharge anywhere on his body. It's not normal for any part of his body to smell bad, including his mouth and ears. Trim his nails as needed so they don't catch on something and tear. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long.Other aspects of grooming preparation are housing and diet. A Curly who sleeps on hard concrete or in a dirty crate will develop a bad coat, which can lead to bald spots. And a poor-quality diet can cause the coat to be dry. Not every dog food is appropriate for every dog. Try different foods until you find the one that meets your Curly's individual dietary needs. You'll know you've found it when he has a super coat and skin.Brush or comb your Curly when he's shedding in the spring and fall, using a wood or plastic wide-toothed comb. More frequent brushing or combing can give his curly coat the frizzies. Taking your Curly swimming or otherwise wetting his coat helps tame the frizzies.Shedding season is also a good time to give him a bath. He shouldn't need one on a regular basis unless he's gotten into something stinky. Use a shampoo made for dogs to keep the coat from drying out.","The Curly-Coated Retriever is a great companion for older children who can stand up to his size and energy level, but he may be overwhelming for younger children who are easily knocked down in play. Any time your Curly interacts with children, lay down some ground rules for dog and child. No ear pulling, tail pulling or biting allowed! For the safety of both, never leave small children unsupervised with any dog.Curly-Coated Retrievers generally do very well with other dogs and animals but socialization is still important in regard to animal interactions.","Curlies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Curlies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Curly rescue.Curly-Coated Retriever Club of AmericaCurly Rescue",not available

The mixed breed is friendly and playful and will love to take part in play sessions with the kids. Play time should still always be supervised.This dog is smart, so make sure to provide interactive toys to keep them alert and intrigued.","The Dachsador is usually described as a small dog. Although, as is always the case with newer mixed dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 30 to 40 pounds and range in height from 15 to 25 inches.","The Dachsador is a great family dog and provides excellent companionship for both individuals and families. If you're lounging on the couch during a lazy afternoon, your Dachsador will happily hop up and snuggle with you.These dogs are friendly and bond well with adults and small children alike; although, they do come with a reputation for being on the stubborn side, so consider that if you're new to socializing and training a dog.Beyond the Dachsador's friendly nature, the mixed breed proves itself to be a lively and energetic dog. Don't be fooled by the Dachsador's relatively small size--this is a canine who loves to be outdoors playing and taking part in exercise sessions.The dog is smart, too, so make sure to provide interactive toys to keep them alert and intrigued. If you have a fenced-in yard, your kids and your Dachsador will happily engage in play sessions together.","Dachsadors are generally considered to be healthy dogs; although, the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Labrador Retriever and Dachshund face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Dachsadors suffer from include:Hip DysplasiaBack problemsEye conditions","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Dachsador's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.The Dachsador is a high energy dog that will need at least two walks a day, ideally between 45 minutes and an hour. Such a smart dog will also benefit from obedience training--with suitable rewards, of course!Outside of exercise, you'll need to brush the breed's teeth around three times a week. This is important to avoid any periodontal problems. Ask your regular vet to recommend a brand of toothpaste and offer tips on brushing technique if needed.You'll also need to monitor and clip your Dachsador's nails every couple of weeks. Check their ears for pests and debris regularly, especially after outdoor play. Clean them as recommended by your vet.","An ideal Dachsador diet should be formulated for a small-sized breed with high energy.Dachsadors need to stick to a heathy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Dachsador's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Dachsador's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","The most common Dachsador colors are chocolate brown, black, and yellow.The Dachsador's coat is somewhere between short and medium in length. The texture is usually described as being dense and wiry to the touch. When it comes to grooming, a quick ten minute brushing session every day or so should be enough to keep the dog's coat in tip top condition.In general, the Dachsador is a pretty adaptable dog when it comes to climate. Just make sure to provide a fashionable dog coat if the weather gets too frosty. During hotter months, you'll also want to make sure shade and fresh water are always available during outside times.","Dachsador dogs and children are a great fit for each other. The mixed breed is friendly and playful and will love to take part in play sessions with the kids.Just be sure to make sure that both the dog and the children have learned how to respectfully behave and interact with each other. This is especially important if your Dachsador shows signs of having a stubborn side. Play time between dogs and kids should always be supervised, even with a well-trained dog.It's also imperative that when a Dachsador is introduced to a household with existing pets, proper socialization is undertaken. Smaller pets cannot be viewed as prey to chase. This also applies during outdoor walks--the mixed breed can easily be tempted to dash off and chase after other animals when their hunting heritage kicks in.Ultimately, early socialization really pays off with this breed. Make sure to reward your Dachsador for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regime when you bring them home to your family.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Dachsador because they are a mixed breed.

Crate-training is recommended.Dachshunds are intelligent dogs with an independent nature and playful spirit. Because of this, they can be mischievous. Be patient, firm, and consistent when training them. Because they were bred for hunting, they can exhibit some behaviors that are related to that. They were designed to dig into badger burrows, and that instinct may lead them to dig up your dahlias instead. They were bred to be tenacious in the hunt, and this instinct may lead them to be relentless in pestering you for a treat. They were bred to not only hunt but kill their prey; in your household, the ""prey"" most likely will be your Dachshund's toys and he will effectively ""kill"" them one after the other.Dachshunds have loud, deep barks for a dog their size - and they do like to bark!If you don't watch out, your Dachshund can become fat and lazy, which will put more strain on his fragile back. Be sure to monitor your Dachshund's food intake and keep him at a healthy weight.Dachshunds are prone to having slipped disks in their backs, which can lead to partial or full paralysis. Don't let them jump from high places, and when you hold them, support their backs.Your Dachshund will probably be a one-person dog. By nature, he can be suspicious of strangers, so it's important to socialize him when he is a puppy.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.","Dachshunds are bred and shown in two sizes: Standard and Miniature. Standard Dachshunds of all varieties (Smooth, Wirehair, and Longhair) usually weigh between 16 and 32 pounds. Miniature Dachshunds of all varieties weigh 11 pounds and under at maturity. Dachshunds that weigh between 11 and 16 pounds are called Tweenies. While this isn't an official classification, Tweenies are not penalized in the show ring. Some people who breed exceptionally small Dachshunds advertise them as Toy Dachshunds, but this is purely a marketing term, not a recognized designation.","The Dachshund is described as clever, lively, and courageous to the point of rashness. He's bred for perseverance, which is another way of saying that he can be stubborn. Dachshunds have a reputation for being entertaining and fearless, but what they want most is to cuddle with their people. For many Dachshund people, this characteristic outweighs having to deal with the breed's insistence on having his own way. The Dachshund personality can also vary with coat type. Because the wirehaired Dachshunds have terrier in their background, they can be mischievous troublemakers. Longhairs are calm and quiet, and Smooths have a personality that lies somewhere in between. Some Mini Dachshunds can be nervous or shy, but this isn't correct for the breed. Avoid puppies that show these characteristics.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents-usually the mother is the one who's available-to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Dachshunds need early socialization-exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences-when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Dachshund puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Not all Bouviers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): Dachshunds are especially prone to having back problems. This may be due to genetics, moving the wrong way, or falling or jumping on or off furniture. Symptoms of a problem include an inability to raise up on the rear legs, paralysis, and sometimes loss of bowel and bladder control. It's important to always support your Dachshund's back and rear when holding him. Treatment may consist of anything from crate confinement with anti-inflammatory medications to surgery to remove the discs that are causing the problem or even confining the dog to a doggie wheelchair. Some owners have found that they can help ward off problems by taking their Dachshunds to chiropractors, acupuncturists, or rehabilitation therapists who have experience working with dogs.Epilepsy: Dachshunds are prone to having epileptic seizes. In dogs that are affected, it's thought that the condition is either genetic or brought about as the result of a fall or a hard blow to the head. If your Dachshund has seizures, take him to your vet to determine what treatment is appropriate. In many cases, epilepsy can be controlled with medication.Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. A DNA test for PRA is available for miniature longhaired Dachshunds.Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV) Also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that most often affects large dogs, but because of their deep chests, it also can affect Dachshunds. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. This is a medical emergency. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited.Cushings Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism): This condition occurs when the body produces too much of a hormone called cortisol. It can be due to an imbalance in the pituitary gland or in the adrenal gland, or it can occur when a dog has too much cortisol from other conditions. The most common signs are excess urination and excess drinking. If your Dachshund exhibits these signs, take him to the veterinarian. There are treatments to help with this disease from the removal of a gland to medications.Canine Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Diabetes is occasionally seen in Dachshunds, particularly if they're overweight. Diabetes can be treated with diet and daily insulin injections. Signs include excessive urination and thirst and weight loss despite a ravenous appetiteDeafness: Hearing loss isn't common in the breed, but it can occur in double dapple Dachshunds. Ask if the puppy and its parents were BAER (Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response) tested for hearing loss. This is not available in all areas but is available at most large specialty practices and teaching hospitals at veterinary schools. It can be done any time after the puppy is five weeks old.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Dachshunds, you should expect to see a health clearance from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF), certifying that the eyes are normal.Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That's because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it's often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.","Dachshunds have a lot of stamina and energy. They love to take a walk or play outdoors with other dogs, and they like to hunt and dig. They are also active inside the house and can do well in small living quarters so long as they get a moderate amount of daily exercise. Two half-mile walks a day (about 10 minutes each) is about right. Occasionally, when time is short, a game of fetch will meet their need for activity.They're not suited to living outdoors or in a kennel but should live in the home. Dachshunds can injure their backs jumping on and off furniture, so get a ramp or steps and teach them to use it if they want up on the sofa or bed. When you hold a Dachshund, always be careful to support his rear and his chest.Dachshunds can learn quickly if properly motivated. Use positive reinforcements such as food rewards or a favorite toy to hold their attention, and keep training sessions short. The Dachshund will quickly become bored if made to repeat the same exercise over and over, so make obedience practice fun and interesting.Housetraining can sometimes be a problem with this breed. A Dachshund may not see the need for eliminating outside. Patience and consistency are musts. Crate training helps as well.Beyond housetraining, crate training is a kind way to ensure that your Dachshund doesn't get into things he shouldn't. Like every dog, Dachshunds can be destructive as puppies. Crate training at a young age will also help your Dachshund accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Dachshund in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Dachshunds are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.The Dachshund excels as a watchdog, but he can be noisy. Minis, in particular, can be yappy. Keep this in mind if your Dachshund will be living in an apartment or condo community.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 1/2 cups of high-quality dry food a dayNote: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Dachshund, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Smooth Dachshund's coat is short and shiny. Single-colored Smooth Dachshunds often are red or cream, perhaps with some black hairs. Two-colored Smooth Dachshunds usually are black, chocolate, wild boar (grizzled), gray (blue) or Isabella (fawn) with tan or cream markings. Dappled Dachshunds have a dappled (merle) pattern in their coats, with light and dark colored areas in even distribution (neither the light nor the dark predominates). Whereas dark eyes are required and little or no white hair on the chest is acceptable for solid- and parti-colored Dachshunds, partially or wholly blue eyes and a large amount of white hair on the chest both acceptable for the dappled Dachshunds. Other color patterns are brindle, in which there are dark stripes all over the body, and sable, where there is an overall dark overlay of hair.Wirehaired Dachshunds have a very different coat from the Smooth Dachshunds. They have short, thick, hard hair on the topcoat with a softer undercoat. The hard topcoat hair is found everywhere on the body except for the jaw, eyebrows, and ears. While all the colors found in the Smooth Dachshund are acceptable for the Wirehair, the most common color is wild boar.Longhaired Dachshunds have glistening, slightly wavy long hair which gives them an elegant appearance. They come in the same colors found in Smooth Dachshunds.Light-colored Dachshunds usually sport light gray, light hazel, green or blue eyes, rather than the various shades of brown. They can also have eyes of two different colors; in rare cases, such as the double-dapple coloration (in which varying amounts of white coloring occur over the body in addition to the dapple pattern), Dachshunds can have a blue and a brown eye.Dachshunds are a low-maintenance breed. They shed, but not excessively. Unless they've rolled in something that smells bad, they generally don't need to be bathed often and are free of doggie odor. Smooths can be wiped with a damp cloth between baths to keep them clean. If you live in a location that is cold in the winter, your Smooth Dachshund may need a sweater when he goes outside.Wirehaired Dachshunds require regular brushing, and they'll need to have their coats ""stripped"" two to three times a year to look their best. Ask the breeder from whom you got your Wirehaired Dachshund or your groomer to show you how to do this.Longhaired Dachshunds must be brushed regularly to prevent mats from forming. They need to be bathed more often than the Smooth Dachshund, and you must blow-dry them afterward for their coat to look good.For all varieties and sizes of Dachshunds, you need to pay special attention to their droopy ears, which can be a breeding ground for fungus, bacteria, and mites. Moisten a cotton ball with an ear cleaner recommended by your veterinarian and wipe the ears out weekly. Don't go any deeper than the first knuckle on your finger and never stick a cotton swab into your dog's ear.Other grooming needs include nail care and dental hygiene. Trim your Dachshund's nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. The earlier you introduce your Dachshund to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is.Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he'll be used to it.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge.

They may not be as fond of your children's friends, so supervise playtime.With his long back, the Dachshund can be easily injured if he's not handled properly. Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Dachshund if they're sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.

Brushing frequently and thoroughly can help to keep shedding under control, but Dalmatians will shed.Dalmatians need training to help make them well-mannered members of the family. They can be headstrong, so without consistent, firm training you could end up with an unmanageable adult.Early socialization to other dogs, cats and other small pets, children, and adults is a must.Dalmatians do not like to spend long periods of time alone. They do best when they can be included in all family activities and sleep and live where their human family does.Families with small children should be aware that Dalmatians are very exuberant and active dogs and may accidentally knock small children down.The animated and live-action movies ""101 Dalmatians,"" both by Disney, caused an extreme rise in the popularity of the breed. Unscrupulous people looking to cash in on the boom bred Dalmatians indiscriminately, paying no attention to health or temperament. Be a cautious and informed consumer when looking for your Dalmatian puppy.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males and females stand between 19 and 24 inches tall. Weight ranges from 48 to 55 pounds. Males are generally larger than females.,"Born to run, the Dalmatian is a high-energy dog with an endless capacity for exercise. He loves attention and has a strong desire to please, making him easy to train through positive reinforcement such as food rewards, praise, and play.He's a smart dog with a sly sense of humor, and will do his best to make you laugh. The Dalmatian is alert and interested in everything that goes on around him and makes an excellent watchdog.Like every dog, the Dalmatian needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Dalmatian puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Dalmatians are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Dalmatians will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Dalmatians, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hereditary deafness is inherited as a polygenic trait and all Dalmatian bloodlines can pass along deafness to their offspring. Approximately eight percent of Dalmatians are born completely deaf and 22 to 24 percent are born with hearing in one ear only. All puppies are born with their ears closed. The ears should open by 12 to 16 days of age. In Dalmatians, the deafness is characterized by the permanent deterioration by the age of six weeks of the organs of Corti, the nerve cell group inside the cochlea that detect sound. Homemade hearing tests such as stomping on the floor, banging pans together are unreliable because the deaf puppy can feel the vibrations and often learns to adapt very well. The only reliable scientific test is the BAER (Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response). This is not available in all areas but is available at most large specialty practices and teaching hospitals at veterinary schools. It can be done any time after the puppy is five weeks old. Dogs that are used for breeding should have been tested for deafness, and many breeders test puppies before they are sent to their new homes.Urolithiasis: The Dalmatian has a unique urinary tract system which makes them susceptible to the formation of urinary tract stones (Urolithiasis). The urine of a Dalmatian contains uric acid instead of urea or allantoin. Stones are formed from the salts of the uric acid. Large stones will lodge in the urethra; small stones also called gravel may pass with the urine. If the urinary tract becomes completely blocked and the condition is not treated promptly it will be fatal. Dalmatians must have adequate water at all times and dietary management with food that is not high in purines can be helpful. You can ask your vet to check your dogs' urine at regular intervals for urate crystals. There is a lot of research being done in this area so new treatment and management protocols are always being developed. Discuss this with your vet.Skin allergies: Many Dalmatians suffer from skin allergies. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies.Hip dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn't fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems.Iris Sphincter Dysplasia: an inherited ocular disorder that can cause sensitivity to bright light, poor night vision, partial or total blindness, and cataracts. At this point it is not frequently seen in Dalmatians although some studies argue that it is often overlooked. The condition and its treatments are being studied.","The Dalmatian is a very active dog and needs plenty of exercise. He's a fast runner with a great deal of stamina. If left to his own devices a Dalmatian will head cross country on a jaunt that could last several days, so always exercise him on leash or in a secure area. Dalmatians thrive with human companionship and do not do well if relegated to the backyard. They should have plenty of time with their family or they will pine.Because of his unique uric acid metabolism, it's important to observe whether your Dalmatian is urinating regularly. For the same reason, be sure to provide him with easy access to fresh water all the time.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Dalmatian, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The distinctive Dalmatian coat is lovely to touch, being short, satiny, and fine. The tops of their heads feel almost like velvet. The base color is white with well-defined dense black or deep brown (liver-colored) round spots that vary from dime size to half dollar size evenly distributed over the coat. Expect to see smaller spots on the legs, head, and tail. Spotted ears add the perfect touch. (Where the Dalmatian's spots came from is a mystery. It's thought that they may have been caused by a mutation in the ticking gene.)Dalmatian puppies are born pure white, and the spots appear as they age. The exception is puppies born with patches, solid masses of dense, brilliant black or liver-colored hair with no white hair. Patches are appreciably larger than normal-size spots, and they have smooth, sharply defined edges.Large color masses formed by overlapping or intermingled spots are not the same as patches. You can tell the difference because these masses have uneven edges or white hairs scattered throughout. Dalmatians with patches aren't right for the show ring, but they make perfectly fine family companions or performance dogs.You may also see tricolor Dalmatians: dogs with tan markings on the head, neck, chest, leg, or tail of a black or liver spotted dog. Like patched Dalmatians, they aren't suited to be show dogs, but nothing stops them from being excellent companion dogs.Dalmatians are clean dogs with little or no ""doggy"" odor, and their coats are dirt-repellent. It's not unusual for these dogs to roll around in the mud and then dry to a gleaming shine.Be aware, however, that they shed year-round. A common joke among people with Dalmatians is that they shed only two different times: during the day and during the night. Expect to brush your Dalmatian weekly with a medium-soft rubber curry brush to get the hair off the dog before it lands on your clothes and furniture.With regular brushing, it shouldn't be necessary to bathe your Dalmatian more than three or four times a year. More frequent bathing removes essential oils from the coat and skin and can make them dry and flaky.Brush your Dalmatian's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.If your dog doesn't wear them down naturally, trim his nails once or twice a month to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Dalmatian to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Just about every kid recognizes a Dalmatian on sight. His love of activity makes the Dalmatian a great playmate for older children, but his rambunctious nature and swishing tail may be overwhelming to toddlers and young children. With early socialization, Dalmatians can get along fine with other dogs and cats.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.","Dalmatians are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Be sure to monitor his food intake and give him regular exercise to keep him in shape.Dandie Dinmonts are independent and can be stubborn when it comes to housetraining. Crate training is recommended.Dandies are reserved with strangers and make good watchdogs. Their bark is surprisingly loud and deep, but being a typically reserved breed, they can be trained to be quiet on command.Because they are terriers, they are prone to chasing rabbits, birds, and even other dogs and cats. Be sure to keep your Dandie on leash when he's not in a secure area.Because of their unusual looks and small size, they could be targets for dog thieves. Although Dandies do well outdoors, they should be kept in your house when you can't supervise them.Dandie Dinmonts are a rare breed. It may be difficult to locate a reputable breeder, and even when you locate one, you may have to wait several months for a litter to be born.While Dandies typically aren't aggressive dogs, they will not back down from a challenge from other dogs, no matter what their size. Be sure to keep your Dandie under control until you know that both he and the other dog are friendly to each other.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Dandie Dinmont Terriers are 8 to 11 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh from 18 to 24 pounds. The length of their bodies, from the top of their shoulders to the base of their tails, should be twice their height, minus one to two inches.","Dandies are typical terriers: independent, bold, tenacious, and intelligent. With people they know, they're affectionate yet dignified but tend to be reserved with strangers.Because Dandies are reserved dogs, they are not ""barkers,"" as are most of their terrier cousins. Dandies will bark when necessary, and their bark is deep and loud. They just don't seem to think it's proper to keep barking after the alarm has been duly noted or to bark just to hear their own voices.Like most terriers, Dandies have a great deal of self-confidence. They are not high-strung as are many terriers, however. Nor do they seem to be out looking for a fight, as many terriers do. Dandies are never bullies, but they won't back down if they are pushed too far. Overall, their motto seems to be ""live and let live.""Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, a Dandie needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he's young. Socialization helps ensure that your Dandie Dinmont puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Dandies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Dandies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Dandies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Glaucoma: Some lines of Dandie Dinmont Terriers appear to be prone to glaucoma, which causes an increase in pressure in the eyeball. Signs of glaucoma are squinting, tearing, rubbing, or redness of the eye. If you notice any of these signs, be sure to have your vet check your dog immediately as treatment should be started preferably within a few hours for greatest success.Cheyletiella yasguri mites: While these mites can invest any dog, it appears that Dandie Dinmont Terrier pups and adults become invested with them more commonly than most other breeds of dogs. Signs of these mites are scaliness on the skin, small white Cheyletiella mites moving on the surface of the skin (walking dandruff), itching, skin redness, and small swollen areas. Your vet can prescribe treatments to get rid of the mites.Spinal problems: A Dandie can easily injure his long back. Be careful to support his back when you pick him up and discourage him from jumping on or off high places. Instead, provide pet steps to the sofa or bed.Epilepsy: Some Dandies have been reported with epilepsy. If your dog has seizures, ask your vet about treatment.","Dandie Dinmont Terriers are adaptable and will enjoy city or country life as long as they get quality time with their people. They can live in smaller quarters, although they need to be walked regularly or have a yard to play in.Two 20- or 30-minute walks daily or time spent playing in the yard will keep them happy. Like all terriers, digging is in their blood, so either supervise outdoor playtime or provide them with their very own digging spot.Never allow them off-leash in unfenced areas as their instinct to hunt and chase may be provoked by the slightest movement of a squirrel, bird, or other dog or cat. An underground electronic fence won't deter them in the least, so stick to a solid barrier.Training your Dandie will take a bit of patience. Like all terriers, Dandies are independent thinkers, and they may often seem reluctant to respond to your commands. They also seem to get bored with repetitive tasks. Make training fun for your Dandie, and you'll be amazed at how quickly he learns and how clever he truly is.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't feel the ribs, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Dandie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Dandie Dinmont Terriers have a crisp topcoat that covers a soft, downy, waterproof undercoat. The topcoat, which is about 2 inches long, gets its crisp texture from the mixture of two-thirds hard hair with one-third soft hair. The topknot is very soft silky hair.They come in two distinctive colors: mustard and pepper. Mustards are a reddish brown to a pale fawn with a creamy white topknot. Peppers are a dark bluish black to a light silvery gray with a silvery white topknot.Although Dandies look very natural, they actually have medium- to high-maintenance coats. Even though they shed very little, Dandies need to be brushed two or three times a week to remove dead hair and prevent matting.Part of keeping your Dandie well-groomed involves plucking dead hair from the coat once or twice a year. Show dogs require this much more often. The hard hairs are stripped out to encourage new hair to grow. Most pet owners find a good professional groomer to strip their Dandie's coats. If you cut your Dandie's hair instead of stripping it, the color and texture changes, becoming lighter and softer.Complete a Dandie's hair care by trimming the hair on top of the muzzle short, and keeping the corners of the eyes free of hair. The soft furnishings — the long hair on the legs, underbody, and head — can be trimmed with scissors, as can the hair between the footpads. Hair in the ears should be removed regularly by gently plucking it out.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Dandie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Dandie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Dandie to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Dandies typically get along well with children and other pets, so long as they are brought up with them or exposed to them in puppyhood. An adult Dandie who's unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.

They are not purebreds like their Doberman Pinscher or Labrador Retriever parents.The most common Doberdor colors include black, chocolate, tan, and fawn. The dog's coat might be solid--inherited from its Labrador Retriever side--or patterned like the Doberman.The Doberdor is not an apartment dog--ideally you'll be living in a place with an enclosed back yard and a large park nearby.Doberdors require way more exercise than your average dog. You're going to be looking at two or three walks per day, totaling well over an hour of exercise. Ball games and interactive toys are also a must.Doberdors get along well with children, though they should be socialized from an early age. As with all dogs, children should be supervised and taught how to properly interact with pets.","The Doberdor is usually described as a large-sized dog. Although, as is always the case with newer dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 60 to 100 pounds and range in height from 24 to 28 inches. Female Doberdors can be noticeably smaller than their male counterparts.","There's no doubt about it: The Doberdor is a large dog who comes with a large amount of responsibility. These dogs can become super loyal and will definitely act as a guardian of your family and property, but they also require an owner with the time, patience, and experience to train and socialize them properly. The breed is very smart, but with that intelligence also comes a degree of stubborness. If you're not confident about training a dog, this might be a breed to pass on.Adding on to the breed's high maintenance status, the Doberdor requires way more exercise than your average dog. You're going to be looking at two or three walks per day, totaling well over an hour of exercise. Ball games and interactive toys are also a must. It goes without saying, the Doberdor is not an apartment dog--ideally you'll be living in a place with an enclosed back yard and a large park nearby. But if you can commit to the breed's needs, you'll have a remarkably social and loyal pet.","Doberdors are generally considered to be healthy dogs--although the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Doberman Pinscher and Labrador Retriever face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Doberdors suffer from include:Elbow DysplasiaWobbler's SyndromeHip Dysplasia","With such an athletic breed like the Doberdor, you'll want to aim to provide around an hour and a half of exercise per day. This should be split up into two or even three separate sessions. Ideally, you'll have access to open outdoor space where the dog can really run and stretch their legs. Games of fetch can also help keep the breed in tip top shape.Beyond exercise, you'll want to check out your Doberdor's teeth, nails and ears about once a month. When it comes to ear cleanings, you're looking to avoid any chances of wax build up. If you're unsure about how to brush your dog's teeth, clip their nails and clean their ears, consult with your vet about the best practices.","An ideal Doberdor diet should be formulated for a large breed with high energy.Doberdors need to stick to a heathy diet as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems--especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Doberdor's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Doberdor's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","The most common Doberdor colors include black, chocolate, tan, and fawn. The dog's coat might be solid--inherited from its Labrador Retriever side--or patterned like the Doberman.The Doberdor's coat is short, often feels dense, and is straight in terms of texture. This isn't a breed that sheds a lot--once a week should do the trick in terms of brushing. Bathing needs are low and should be undertaken if the dog seems dirty. Ask your vet if you wish to put into place a regular bathing routine for your Doberdor.Due to their coat, the Doberdor does much better in warmer rather than colder climates. If you live in a place that's prone to frosty spells, kit your Doberdor out with a fetching canine jacket.","In a best case scenario, Doberdors and kids get on great and form very close bonds. Think of the dog as like an older sibling, full of love and protective instincts. But it's imperative that the breed is socialized and trained correctly from the youngest possible age. Teaching children to act responsibly around the dog is also a must.Most Doberdors will be okay living with other animals and pets--but you will need to very quickly let the breed know that cats and rabbits are not to be considered as prey. Again, early socialization between the breed and any resident pets is key.Ultimately, early socialization pays off--so make sure to reward your Doberdor for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regime when you bring them home to your family.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Doberdors because they are a mixed breed.

Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Dobie needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Dobie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Dobies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Dobies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Dobies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Von Willebrand's Disease: An inherited blood disorder, this condition interferes with the blood's ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Most dogs with von Willebrand's disease can lead normal lives, however. A vet can test your dog for the condition; dogs with this condition should not be bred.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland that's thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It's treated with medication and diet.Wobbler's Syndrome: Suspected to be an inherited condition in Dobermans, affected dogs suffer from spinal cord compression caused by cervical vertebral instability or from a malformed spinal canal. Extreme symptoms are neck pain and paralysis of the legs. Surgical therapy is hotly debated, because in some cases the condition can recur even after such treatment.Cardiomyopathy: This is a disease of the heart muscle, which becomes thin and weak. It's characterized by an expansion or widening (dilatation) of the heart chambers, resulting in an abnormally large heart. This disease eventually results in heart failure, since the damaged heart muscle is too weak to efficiently pump blood to the rest of the body. Treatment varies but includes oxygen, fluid therapy, and medication that improves heart function.Albinoism: Albinoism is a genetic condition that affects the Doberman Pinscher. An albino is not just a white dog but a dog with pink skin and nose, and blue or light eyes. Albinos are sensitive to sunlight and can suffer from a variety of health conditions, including cancer and eye problems. Albino dogs should not be bred.Color Mutant Alopecia: This is a condition of the coat associated with blue or fawn coat colors. It affects blue and occasionally red Dobies. Most dogs who develop this condition are born with normal coats; symptoms generally start to show up at four months to three years of age. As the dog grows and matures, he develops brittle hair, followed by patchy hair loss. Only the blue portions of the coat are affected. Secondary infection and inflammation is common. The condition is incurable, although medicated shampoos may help reduce scaling and itching.Narcolepsy: This is a neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate wake-sleep patterns. A dog with narcolepsy may suddenly become sleepy and in fact fall asleep. Research for treatment is underway.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Doberman Pinschers. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.","The Doberman Pinscher is best suited to a suburban or country home with room for him to romp. He needs a lot of exercise every day; this demand can be tiring to owners who aren't up to the job. He needs a home with a securely fenced yard, for his safety and for the safety of people and animals who inadvertently walk into his turf.He should not be left alone for long periods of time or relegated to the backyard as an outside dog. He should not be chained, either. The Dobie needs to be part of his family, participating in all family activities.The Dobie needs early socialization and training. Like any dog, he can become timid or quarrelsome if he isn't properly socialized when he's still young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Dobie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Tail docking is usually done when pups are very young. Ear cropping, however, is the owner's responsibility, not the breeder's, and it's done by a veterinarian when the puppy is a few months old. It requires surgery and several months of care afterward. If you like the look of cropped ears, consider the care and expense as well.The public reaction to the Dobie is often one of fear. It's wise to be sensitive to this, and keep your Dobie leashed in public places.","Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Dobie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Dobie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The sleek, smooth Dobie coat is short and lies close to the skin. He may have a slight undercoat around the neck. His coat colors are black, red, blue, and fawn. He has rust markings above each eye; on his muzzle, throat, and chest; and on his legs and feet.The Dobie's sleek coat requires minimal grooming. He is a clean dog, with minimal doggie odor. Don't be fooled by his coat length — the short coat does shed. Weekly brushing with a grooming mitt or rubber curry is sufficient, however, as is a bath when the Dobie rolls in something that smells bad or plays in the mud. Frequent bathing, however, isn't necessary.Brush your Dobie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Dobie to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The well-bred Doberman is a wonderful family dog. He is trustworthy and protective of the children in his family, as long as he's been socialized and trained appropriately. Children must be respectful and kind to the Dobie, and he will be just that in return.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.He's also friendly with other dogs and animals in his home, especially if he has been raised with them. He can be aggressive toward dogs outside his family if he considers them a threat to his loved ones.","Dobies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Dobies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Dobie rescue.The Doberman Pinscher Club of AmericaCheck out Road to Rescue's SPOTlight on Illinois Doberman Rescue Plus.","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Doberman.Doberman Pinscher Club of America"

They are not purebreds like their Dachshund or Cocker Spaniel parents.The main colors of Dockers are red, black, brown, or tan. They are usually a solid color but can have a second color mixed in.Their coats tend to be a combination of both parents' coats. Short and wiry from the Dachshund parent with a blend of the of Cocker Spaniel's soft and silky hair throughout.Dockers are not well suited for extreme weather. They may need doggy jackets in cold winters and doggy sunscreen in summer months.Dockers can bark a lot. They make great watchdogs. Early training can help curb unwanted barking tendencies.These dogs don't enjoy being left alone for long periods of time. They may get anxious and destructive without companionship during the day.","As the Docker is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Cocker Spaniel and Dachshund parents, you can expect Dockers to be small to medium in size.Most weigh in at 20 to 30 pounds and range in height from nine to 15 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger.Females typically run slightly smaller than the males.","Many Docker lovers describe these dogs' personalities as loyal and affectionate. Since they come from a line of hunter parents, these sweet pooches will most likely have high prey drive and would enjoy chasing squirrels and birds around a yard.They come from a line of barky parents, too, and can be barky themselves. If you want a watchdog who will alert you to anyone who might approach your door, you can't do much better than the Docker.These dogs do best with early training to curb any unwanted barking habits. They can be stubborn and difficult to house train, but for a patient and consistent dog parent, their desire to please you will go a long way.If you are a single person who has to work all day, this is probably not the pup for you, as they may have destructive behavior when anxious or left alone for long stretches.","The Docker mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Cocker Spaniel and Dachshund also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Possible health concerns will depend on which parental traits are more dominant. Some of the more common health problems Dockers suffer from include:Intervertebral Disk DiseaseDiabetesUrinary Track IssuesAllergiesHypothyroidismHip Displasia","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Docker's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Dockers are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good 45 to 60 minute walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be loudly clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Docker's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as many smaller breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.Also, check YouTube for teeth care and nail trimming tutorials.","An ideal Docker diet should be formulated for a small- to medium-sized breed with moderate to high energy levels. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day.As with all dogs, the Docker dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Docker's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Docker coats are often a mix of their Dachshund and Cocker Spaniel parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Dockers are red, black, brown, or tan. They are usually a solid color but can have a second color mixed in.Their coats tend to be a combination of both parents' coats. Short and wiry from the Dachshund parent with a blend of the of Cocker Spaniel's soft and silky hair throughout. The blend typically will do well with a weekly brushing. But if they inherited more of the Spaniel parent's hair, daily brushing may be required. Your vet or groomer should be able to help with a schedule.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Docker's aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. When your dog is fully grown, you will have a better idea of coat care and if additional winter clothing is required in colder climates. You may also need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.","The Docker is a sturdy yet sensitive breed and will most likely do well with child members of the family. As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.When it comes to other pets, Dockers can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. If the Dachshund parent's personality prevails, the Docker may want to lead the pack in multi-dog homes.Always be cautious introducing new dogs to each other. Nose to butt is a good sign, as is tail wagging. If they are eye to eye, separate them immediately.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Dockers because they are a mixed breed.

It is not natural for them to want to fight, but some people train them to do so anyway because of their strength and courageous nature.Because they are used in dog fighting rings, Dogo Argentinos have been deemed dangerous and banned in several countries, including Australia, the Cayman Islands, Denmark, Fiji, Iceland, Singapore, and Ukraine. In the United Kingdom, it is illegal to own one without lawful authority.Dogo Argentinos are sometimes used for work with the police, military, and search and rescue efforts.The breed is beloved for its loyalty and courage--qualities that make them excellent watchdogs.About 10 percent of Dogo Argentinos suffer from pigment-related deafness in one or both ears, which is an affliction that often affects dogs that have white coats.Socialization and early training are important for keeping the Dogo Argentino well-behaved. They are physically strong and strong-willed, so they need a firm trainer that can keep them in line without resorting to force or physical punishment. They are not a breed for novice owners.This breed is often confused with the American Bulldog, though it is taller and has a white coat. It may also be confused with the American Pit Bull Terrier, though the Dogo Argentino is much larger and is different in many ways.","Dogo Argentinos are large dogs that grow to a standard height of about 24 to 27 inches at the shoulder. Males tend to be slightly taller than females by about an inch on average. The breed usually weighs between 80 and 100 pounds. The body is usually slightly longer than it is tall, and Dogo Argentinos have large, broad heads that make them resemble the American Bulldog or the American Pit Bull Terrier. Although these sizes are considered ""breed standard,"" some Dogo Argentinos may be quite a bit bigger or smaller.","The Dogo Argentino is a loyal breed with a tendency to be highly territorial, making them excellent watchdogs. They are fierce defenders of their human families, even children, though their strong prey drive makes them poor companions for other animals like cats or smaller dogs. That prey drive does, however, make them great hunters, able to take down wild boars with their ferocity and strength.They are independent dogs that need an experienced owner to handle their training needs, especially when it comes to socialization, as the Dogo Argentino is known for being less than welcoming to strangers and other dogs. They are strong-willed and need plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, so apartment living isn't the ideal situation for them. It is best to begin their training early as puppies.","The Dogo Argentino is predisposed to a few health problems. One of the major issues is deafness, with about 10 percent of dogs in the breed being deaf in one or both ears. This is called pigment-related deafness, and is found in other mostly-white colored dogs, including Dalmatians, white Boxers, and white Bull Terriers.The breed may develop other conditions, including hypothyroidism, glaucoma, and laryngeal paralysis. Dogo Argentinos may also suffer from hip dysplasia, which is common among large breeds.","It is important to provide Dogo Argentinos with plenty of exercise and mental stimulation, as they may become bored, anxious, and destructive if their needs are not met. As with dogs of any breed, you should keep up with regular vet checkups, keep their teeth clean, and groom them as needed. They should have their ears checked weekly and their nails trimmed monthly. Ask your veterinarian about your individual dog's needs and make sure you keep up with at-home care.","Dogo Argentinos will need a diet formulated for large breed dogs with plenty of fresh, clean water. They are a fairly high-energy breed, which should also be taken into account. Feeding needs will change from puppyhood into adulthood. The best way to create an appropriate feeding plan for your individual Dogo Argentino is to speak to your veterinarian or a professional nutritionist about their needs. They will be able to provide you with specific guidance.","The Dogo Argentino has a short, all-white coat, though there is sometimes a black spot on the head. Though the coat is short and fairly easy to maintain, the size of the Dogo Argentino makes the grooming process a little more difficult. Dogo Argentinos should be brushed weekly and bathed every three months or sooner if they get dirty. They will shed a fair amount, but the length of their coat makes this a little bit less noticeable than long-haired breeds. Still, you'd do well to have a lint roller on hand.","Dogo Argentinos are very loyal to their families, including children, so long as they are introduced and accustomed to their presence. However, visiting children may present a bit more of a challenge, as this breed does not naturally take to strangers. Children should always be supervised with dogs, even when they are family, and they should be trained on how to interact with animals to avoid incidents. Socializing Dogo Argentinos early and training them to interact with new people and animals will help, and the earlier training begins, the better.Dogo Argentinos have a high prey drive, which can cause trouble when it comes to smaller pets, including cats and other dogs. They may learn to interact with these animals if they are trained and socialized properly, but this breed is best suited to a home that has no other pets or only has other large dogs.","If you're interested in adopting a Dogo Argentino from a rescue group, you can try DC Dogos, an organization based in Tampa, Florida that works specifically with the breed.

Although, as is always the case with newer dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 15 to 28 pounds and range in height from nine to twelve inches. Female Dorgis are often noticeably smaller than their male counterparts.","Think of the Dorgi as like a toddler: They're undoubtedly cute, they have an infectious playful streak, but there's definitely the chance of some stubborness going on. If you're looking to bring a dog into your home, and you already have kids or other small pets, the Dorgi is a great breed to consider. This is a dog who will always want to seek out companionship--although the downside is they may experience some loneliness if you're away for long periods of the day.The stubborn part of the Dorgi's personality comes from their intelligence. The breed often gives off the impression that they think they know best--so it's vital that proper training is implemented from day one, along with continued use of interactive toys during play sessions to keep the dog mentally stimulated.","Dorgis are generally considered to be healthy dogs--although the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Dachshund and Corgi face.

Try and aim for up to an hour of exercise every day--and make sure to incorporate fetch games into the routine. If you have a safe, fenced-in yard, your Dorgi will love to frolic outdoors. The breed also very much likes to eat, so in tandem with providing enough exercise, monitor feedings and exercise caution when it comes to snacks and treats--otherwise obesity might set in and lead to health complications.Make sure to stay on top of the condition of the breed's nails and teeth--your vet can advise you on a proper routine if needed. Also, you'll want to apply a cotton ball to the dog's ears once a week to check for mites or signs of moisture that could signify the onset of an infection.","An ideal Dorgi diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy.Dorgis need to stick to a heathy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Dorgi's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years.

They are not purebreds like their Dachshund or Poodle parents.Doxiepoos can have a range of fur colors, including white, cream, gray, black, and brown.Grooming needs depend on which type of coat the Doxiepoo inherits. If they take after their Dachshund parent, their short coats will be low maintenance. If they take after the poodle, they may need more frequent brushing but may also be better for allergy sufferers.Doxiepoos can tolerate any climate, but they do prefer warmer temperatures. A winter coat may help your dog navigate cold or snowy winter weather.Doxiepoos tend to do best in single pet households, but they can get along with other pets, especially if they're socialized from an early age.Because they are small, Doxiepoos can get injured or frightened by children who play rough. These dogs love all people, even kids, but prefer gentle play. Never leave children with dogs of any breed unsupervised.","Because Doxiepoo combinations are so unpredictable, there's a wide range in size for this mixed breed. They can weigh anywhere from five to thirty pounds, and their height spans from eight to 23 inches--making them either small or medium dogs.","Although it's impossible to know exactly which parent a Doxiepoo may take after more--Dachshund or Poodle--you can be sure you will get an adorable, affectionate, playful, intelligent family dog.Both parent breeds can tend to bark a lot, so it's important to start training as early as possible to temper this habit. Another habit that's important to temper early is the stubbornness the Doxiepoo may inherit from the Dachshund--it may make training more difficult, but not impossible. Poodles are known for being easy to train, so again, it's uncertain which temperament you'll end up with. However, Poodles are also known for being clever and mischievous, so either way, you will have a playful, fun-loving pup.Doxiepoos are extremely affectionate, known for giving ample kisses, which is a win in our book. So you're not going to have a mean dog--just possibly a willful one.However, Doxiepoos can be a bit jealous with all that affection, so they do best in a single-pet home. Although, they can tolerate other pets, if they are socialized early in puppyhood. They do well with children and people in general, and they can adapt to both apartments and houses with yards, provided they are allowed exercise time.","As with all mixed breeds, there is a potential for the Doxiepoo to inherit the worst genetic predispositions from both their Dachshund and Poodle sides--especially as this particular combination is so hard to predict.

The reason Doxiepoos end up in shelters so often is based on unpredictable appearance more than anything else, so you shouldn't be afraid that a Doxiepoo shelter dog necessarily has a health condition.","As with all dogs, yearly check-ups with the vet are important to maintain ideal health.As Doxiepoos are pretty energetic, they require daily exercise, but it need not be intense. They enjoy walks around the neighborhood or park. They do not enjoy being outside by themselves--indeed, it's not a good idea, as they are often much smaller and more gentle than predatory animals. Instead, they love being around the family as much as possible, participating in daily activities.Doxiepoos are very intelligent and can get bored if left alone too much. Walking to new places together stimulates Doxiepoos' minds and helps them with separation anxiety. They don't need a large living space, provided they get accompanied exploration outside.Teeth should be cleaned at least twice a week to maintain dental health. Ears should be cleaned every so often with a veterinary-approved solution to avoid ear infections. Make sure to trim your dog's nails as needed. They should not click against the floor. Your groomer can help you with this.","An ideal Doxiepoo diet should be formulated for a small or medium breed--depending on your individual Doxiepoo's size--with high energy. Because the Doxiepoo struggles with obesity, be careful not to overfeed your dog. Talk to your vet about specific food portions and treat allotments.As with all dogs, the Doxiepoo's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Doxiepoo's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Doxiepoos can have a range of fur colors, including white, cream, gray, black, and brown.If they inherit the Dachshund hair type, their coat will be short, coarse, and low-maintenance. Poodle fur, however, is longer and curlier, and more regular brushing and trims are required to avoid tangles and keep the fur looking its best. Poodle hair is allergy-friendly. In general, Doxiepoos should be brushed at least twice a week, and they should be bathed every six-to-eight weeks.Doxiepoos can tolerate any climate, but they do prefer warmer temperatures. A winter coat may help your Doxiepoo navigate cold or snowy winter weather.","Doxiepoos generally do well with children and adults, though they may bark a lot when they first meet them. Doxiepoos tolerate gentle behavior from children very well, and they have a very loving relationship. However, rough behavior with Doxiepoos, like pulling on the ears or tail, will not go well--they can be small and easily frightened, and they may even nip in defense.Doxiepoos prefer to be the only pet in a home, but they can get along with other dogs or animals if they are socialized at an early age. Every dog is different, but in general, early socializing is key if you don't want your Doxiepoo to be a solo dog.With training and care, Doxiepoos can be their best selves--a loving family dog.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Doxiepoos because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Dachshund or Poodle breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well.

They are not purebreds like their Dachshund or Beagle parents.There are many color combinations a Doxle may have, especially since both parents are often a mix of colors. These colors include solids or mixes of tan, black, golden, chocolate, white, and brown.Doxles can tolerate some hot and cold weather, but generally, they will be more comfortable in warmer weather than cold.If your Doxle has a short, smooth coat, a weekly brushing should be adequate to keep their coat in peak condition. If the fur is wiry or long, more frequent brushing may be required.Doxles are active dogs and need at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. Experts recommend at least two walks per day, as well as ample play time.You may want to prepare for their instinct to dig by allowing your Doxle a spot in the yard that you wouldn't mind being overturned.The mixed breed's Dachshund parents have smaller bodies with long spines that make them especially prone to injury, so Doxles would be a better fit for older or more gentle children.","Since Doxles are a relatively new mixed breed, their sizes can vary quite a bit. They are generally considered small-medium dogs.They tend to weigh in at eleven to 30 pounds and range in height from five to 15 inches. Some may be smaller or larger.","Doxles are wonderful family dogs, watchdogs, and companion dogs, all rolled into one. As both Dachshunds and Beagles are hunting dogs, they are curious and attentive--often a charming trait, but you may want to prepare for their instinct to dig by allowing them a spot in the yard that you wouldn't mind being overturned. They are extremely active, which is good news both for getting your daily steps in, as well as keeping their propensity for obesity at bay.With so much love in their hearts, Doxles can get lonely if left alone for too long, so make sure you or another dog spend enough time at home during the day before adding one into your family. You may also have to get used to having an adorable shadow, as your Doxle will likely want to follow you around and observe exactly what you're doing. Although Doxles get along beautifully with other dogs and all ages of humans, it's not the best idea to add small animals, especially of the prey-sized variety, to the environment, as it will be hard for your Doxle to fight their hunter genetics.Doxles can tend to bark a lot, especially at people they don't know (the trade-off for a great watchdog), and the Dachshund side can lend some stubbornness--but both of these can be overcome somewhat with early training. Early training can even decrease their hunting tendency to chase or growl at smaller animals.Funny, cheerful, inquisitive, loyal, loving--these are just a few traits you will enjoy about your Doxle. Their playful antics will keep you guessing and laughing.","Overall, Doxles are fairly healthy dogs. More common afflictions are luckily pretty easy to keep an eye on, such as ear infections or obesity. The weaker Dachshund back is also something fairly easy to watch out for--mostly, just to be careful children don't sit on or push on their backs, as well as not encouraging huge jumps or running up and down stairs.Doxles can be prone to other health issues, as well, from both their Dachshund and Beagle heritage. Some of the more common problems Doxles suffer from include:intervertebral disc diseasepatellar luxationhip dysplasiacherry eyeglaucomahypothyroidismepilepsy","As with all dogs, annual check-ups are a good way to maintain your Doxle's health and keep up with vaccinations. Your vet can also help you develop a care plan to keep your pup healthy.Doxles are extremely active dogs and need at least 30 minutes of exercise every day, which is also a great way to combat their propensity for obesity. Experts recommend at least two walks per day, as well as ample ""play time"" to explore in the home or, ideally, outside. Because of the hunting instincts in these breeds, you should expect some amount of digging outside.Brushing their teeth two to three times per week will maintain good dental health. Regular nail trims are also necessary. Because Doxles are prone to ear infections, it's important to check ears for wax build-up regularly. You can clean their ears with a cloth and vet-approved ear-cleaning solution weekly, or as needed.","An ideal Doxle diet should be formulated for a small- to medium-sized breed with high energy. This mixed breed is prone to obesity, so be careful to keep feeding portions regulated and treats to a minimum.As with all dogs, the Doxle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years.

If the fur is wiry or long, more frequent brushing may be required. Hand-stripping two or three times per year, by you or by a groomer, is often recommended to remove excess loose fur once a new coat has come in. This is painless for the dog, provided the old coat is ready to go.Doxles can tolerate some hot and cold weather, but generally, they will be more comfortable in warmer weather than cold. If you notice your dog is especially reluctant to go outside in the winter or even shivers, you can try a winter coat or sweater to keep them warm. The short Dachshund profile can make their bellies quick to get cold or wet in winter weather.","This mixed breed's Dachshund parents have smaller bodies with long spines that make them especially prone to injury, so Doxles would be a better fit for older or more gentle children.

Short haired Dutch Shepherds are the most commonly used for police work, and wire haired Dutch Shepherds are quite rare in general.Originally, the main thing that separated Dutch Shepherds from German Shepherds or Belgian Shepherds was coat color. All three breeds have gained more distinguishing features and breed standards since then.Dutch Shepherds were almost pushed to the brink of extinction after World War II when breeding in the Netherlands was stopped and many dogs were taken for service in the German military.Unlike other shepherd dogs, Dutch Shepherds have relatively few health problems.The Dutch Shepherd is an excellent watchdog and very loyal to their families. They are not known to be overly vocal, but they will bark if a stranger enters their territory.The coat of the Dutch Shepherd is brindle with colors that range from sandy gold to red chestnut. Too much black or white in the fur is seen as a fault.","Male Dutch Shepherds are slightly larger on average than females, standing at 22 to 25 inches, while females come in at around 21 to 24 inches. The breed tends to grow to about 50 to 70 pounds in weight. While these are considered standard sizes, some individuals in the breed may be larger or smaller.","Dutch Shepherds are known for their intelligence and all-around competency in just about everything, including agility, acting as watchdogs, search and rescue, herding, field training, police work, guide dog duty, and just being a family companion. They are highly trainable and eager to please, soaking up new commands like a sponge. This breed requires a confident trainer who can set boundaries, keep dogs interested in learning, and build a trusting relationship. Early socialization training is important and will help them stay calm around new people and pets. The Dutch Shepherd is an excellent watchdog and usually barks when a stranger enters their territory. This can be beneficial, but it is also important for dogs to learn to interact with guests appropriately. Dutch Shepherds are great with family, even children and other pets, and they are very affectionate and obedient. They will, however, need plenty of exercise, both mentally and physically, to keep from becoming bored and destructive.","Dutch Shepherds are generally a very healthy breed. There are some instances of Dutch Shepherds developing hip dysplasia, but these instances are more rare than in similar breeds, such as German Shepherds.","As with all dogs, you should take your Dutch Shepherd for regular veterinary check-ups and keep up with any at-home care recommended by your veterinarian. Dutch Shepherds' nails grow fairly quickly and will need to be trimmed as needed to avoid cracking, splitting, or injury. Their ears should also be checked at least weekly and cleared of any debris or wax buildup, as this can lead to infection. The teeth should also be brushed regularly. Ask your veterinarian for tips on how to perform these care basics for your dog. It is important to make sure that you keep up with your Dutch Shepherd's daily exercise needs. They'll need at least one good, long walk per day, and maybe some vigorous play sessions. If they are not mentally and physically stimulated, they may become bored, anxious, and destructive.","A Dutch Shepherd's diet should be formulated for an active, mid-to-large size dog with somewhat high energy levels. You should ask your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on which foods and portions are best for your individual dog. You should also discuss adding fish oil supplements to their diet, as this can help keep their coat shiny and their skin healthy.","The Dutch Shepherd comes in three different coats--short hair, wire hair (also called rough hair), and long hair. The short hair has a woolly undercoat. Wire hair also has a woolly undercoat and is very dense and course. The long hair is straight and a bit harsh to the touch. All of these coats keep the Dutch Shepherd comfortable in most types of weather. They are generally brindle with various shades of gold and silver. Some can be a light, sandy color while others can be a shade of red. Too much black or white in the coat is usually seen as a fault. When it comes to grooming, the short and long haired coats need regular brushing to remove loose or dead hairs, especially from the undercoat. The wire haired coat should be groomed by a professional twice a year and should not be brushed, though it can be combed from time to time. Dutch Shepherds should be bathed as needed, as it removes the skin's natural oils.","Dutch Shepherds are quite loyal to their families, including children. They tend to love humans that they are familiar with and will only bark or act standoffish to strangers, which makes them excellent watchdogs. Children should, of course, be supervised when playing with Dutch Shepherds, as they should with any dog, to make sure that playtime doesn't get out of hand. Children should also be trained on how to handle animals properly to avoid incident. Dutch Shepherds are also usually fine with other dogs and pets. Starting socialization training early can help Dutch Shepherds' natural friendliness and make sure they stay calm with new people and animals.","If you're interested in adopting a Dutch Shepherd, you can check out North American Dutch Shepherd Rescue, a non-profit organization that specializes in finding homes for this breed.

Teach him to come to you when you call.Cockers have a ""soft"" personality. Harsh training methods may make them fearful or shut down altogether. Be sure to use gentle, consistent training to get the best results.If your English Cocker doesn't get enough exercise, he may become obese and destructive.An English Cocker Spaniel's long ears are susceptible to ear infections.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Male English Cocker Spaniels stand 16 to 17 inches tall and weigh 28 to 34 pounds. Females are 15 to 16 inches tall and weigh 26 to 32 pounds.,"The English Cocker is described as merry and affectionate with an equable disposition. He's playful, trainable, and friendly toward people (although sometimes reserved with strangers) and other dogs. English Cockers will bark to let you know someone's approaching, so they're good watchdogs, but as typical spaniels they'll happily show the burglar where the silver is.Like every dog, English Cocker Spaniels need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your English Cocker puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","English Cockers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all English Cockers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In English Cockers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Eye problems: Cockers are prone to a variety of eye problems, including Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells that progresses to blindness; cataracts, a cloudy film that forms over the eye; glaucoma, a condition in which pressure builds up inside the eyeball; and eye abnormalities. If you notice any redness in your Cocker's eyes, or if he starts rubbing his face a lot, take him to the vet for a checkup.Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment, and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Cockers may be able to lead normal, healthy lives, although you will have to monitor their exercise and not allow them to overdo it. In severe cases, your Cocker may require hip replacement surgery to get around easily.Renal Failure: Failure of the kidneys at a young age (between the ages of 9 and 24 months) occurs occasionally and is thought to be inherited.Congenital Sensorineural Deafness: This is a condition that is currently found only in parti-colored English Cockers. This condition is present at birth for affected puppies with degeneration of their hearing progressing to deafness by the age of 4 weeks. Some English Cocker breeders are beginning to test dogs for deafness before breeding them.Dilated Cardiomyopathy: This is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes overly distended. It appears to affect primarily solid-colored English Cockers. Signs include weight loss, weakness, abdominal distention, coughing, fainting, and a rapid heart beat. Diagnosis is made with x-rays and echocardiography.","English Cocker Spaniels are adaptable and can even do well living in an apartment as long as they receive daily exercise to keep them in shape. This is a breed with a great deal of stamina, so he'll enjoy long, brisk walks, games of fetch, or sports such as agility or flyball.Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch.From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile.After he's a year old, your English Cocker pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.Teach your English Cocker with a gentle hand. He has a sensitive spaniel temperament and won't respond well to harshness. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play. He's a fast learner, and if you make training consistent and fun, you'll be more than pleased with his abilities.Like all dogs, English Cockers have a mischievous side. They're also chowhounds. Keep food and garbage out of reach, as well as anything else you don't want them to get into, especially during the curious puppy period. A crate is a great way to prevent your English Cocker from getting into trouble when you're not around to supervise.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.English Cockers like to eat, and they will put on the pounds if you're not careful. Keep your English Cocker in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your English Cocker, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","English Cocker Spaniels have medium-long coats that are flat or slightly wavy, with a silky texture. The legs, chest, and belly are covered with longer hair called feathering, but not as much as that of their cousin, the American Cocker Spaniel. Feathering is more than decorative; it helps to protect the dog's body from scratches or other injuries as he makes his way through the field.English Cockers come in coats of many colors. Among them are parti-color (white with black, liver, or shades of red); solid black, liver, or shades of red; black and tan; and liver and tan. Any of the colors or patterns may come with tan points on the eyebrows, muzzle, throat, rump, and feet. Of all the English Cocker colors, blue roan is most popular.Brush your English Cocker's coat every other day and any time he's been in the field. You can trim the feathering so it doesn't drag on the ground and the feet so they look neat.The coat of an English Cocker show dog requires more effort. It must be stripped by hand or with a stripping knife. If you plan to show your English Cocker, you'll want to apprentice with a breeder to learn how to groom the coat properly.Clean the ears weekly with a cleanser recommended by the dog's breeder or veterinarian. Because the ears hang down, they're prone to ear infections. When you clean them, check for signs of infections, such as a bad smell, redness, tenderness, or itchiness. If your English Cocker frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear, take him to the vet for a checkup. When it comes to ear infections, it's best to start treatment as soon as possible.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria. Daily is better if you want to keep your English Cocker's mouth healthy.Trim the nails once or twice a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails will help keep your dog's foot in good condition and will prevent them from scratching your legs when your English Cocker enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your English Cocker to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","English Cockers are friendly, fun-loving, and gentle family dogs who do well with children, especially if they're brought up with them. Adult English Cockers who aren't familiar with children may do best in a home with older children who understand how to interact with dogs.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.English Cockers enjoy the company of other dogs and can also get along fine with cats, especially if they're introduced at an early age.","English Cockers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many English Cockers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They are an active breed indoors, which makes them unsuitable for small dwellings.Before you purchase your English Foxhound, research the breed and to talk to breeders. The English Foxhound is not the breed for everyone, and because the information about him is limited it is easy to purchase this breed while failing to properly understand its limitations and idiosyncrasies.English Foxhounds need a strong owner who is fair and consistent. Obedience training is a must and should begin at an early age.This breed does well with children, but English Foxhounds are quite active and bouncy when they are young. For that reason, they are not recommended for homes with small children.Being pack dogs, English Foxhounds do well with other dogs and actually do better in homes where there are other dogs. They can become bored and destructive when they are the only dog in the home.English Foxhounds are a rare breed and it may be difficult to find a responsible breeder. Breeders with puppies available may have a long waiting list.Bred to pursue prey, the English Foxhound still possesses this drive. For this reason, they should have a fenced yard and should be walked on leash as they may not come back if they are in pursuit of something interesting.The English Foxhound generally does well with other animals in the home, but it is important to understand that they are prey driven and may chase smaller animals.English Foxhounds have a loud bark.

Males are larger than females.,"English Foxhounds have the typical independent — some might say stubborn — hound personality. They do best with people who provide firm and consistent training. Training should begin at a young age and should continue through all levels of puppy development. Puppy socialization classes are very good for all breeds, and the English Foxhound is no exception.Obedience training may take some time and patience, but in the end you are left with an excellent companion dog, except in the case of the come command. English Foxhounds should be leash trained and should be kept on lead whenever they are out of a securely fenced area. They will pursue ""prey"" heedless of any commands their owners give.English Foxhounds have a baying bark that they are happy to demonstrate for everyone, including strangers they see approaching their home. In that sense they make good watchdogs, but despite a natural distrust of strangers, they are easygoing hounds and don't really have the protective nature of a guard dog.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the English Foxhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your English Foxhounds puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start.

This disease is found in many breeds of dogs. Although it is a genetic disease that breeders screen for, it can occur in a puppy with parents free of the disease. When that happens, it is usually linked to environmental conditions such as poor nutrition or putting on too much weight at an early age.Renal Disease: Also known as kidney disease, it occurs when the kidneys are unable to clear the blood of certain toxins such as creatinine and urea.Epilepsy: The English Foxhound can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated with medications, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder.","Bred to be a fast hunter with a great deal of stamina, the English Foxhound requires a substantial amount of exercise. If he can't hunt in a field as he was bred to do, take him on daily runs or provide other exercise that will help him burn off his natural energy.He's used to kennel life and can live outdoors if accompanied by another social dog and provided with appropriate shelter. If he's an only dog, however, he should live indoors with his human pack so he won't get lonely.It is important to crate train your English Foxhound puppy. Puppies explore, get into things they shouldn't, and chew things that can harm them. It can be expensive both in fixing or replacing destroyed items as well as the vet bills that could arise.

Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Foxhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","English Foxhounds have a shiny, short, dense coat with a hard texture. They usually come in a tricolor pattern of black, white, and tan, but they can also be white with hare (more tan than black and white, giving the look of a hare), badger (a mixture of white, gray, brown, and black hairs), tan, or yellow.A weekly brushing with a rough cloth or hound mitt removes loose hair. Like all dogs, English Foxhounds shed, but regular brushing will keep hairfall to a minimum. Check his ears, eyes, mouth, and skin for any sores or infections while you are grooming.Regular brushing should keep your English Foxhound clean. There's no need to bathe him unless he's dirty or smelly. Use a high-quality dog shampoo to avoid drying out the skin and coat. Wipe the outer ear canal with a cotton swab or ball, but don't insert anything into the ear canal.Start grooming your English Foxhound puppy when he's young so he'll become accustomed to having you touch and examine him. By making grooming an enjoyable experience for him, you'll also make him more willing to accept veterinary exams and other handling by people. Think of grooming not simply as maintenance but as a wonderful bonding experience between the two of you.Brush your English Foxhound's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Keep nails short so they don't splinter. If you are uncomfortable trimming your English Foxhound's nails, take him to a groomer or have it done at your veterinary clinic.","The English Foxhound is great with older children who are a match for his energetic and bouncy nature. He's not recommended for homes with small children simply because they're too easily knocked over by the swishing tail or enthusiastic antics of a rambunctious dog. Kind as they are, English Foxhounds, like all breeds, should never be left unsupervised with young children.Being pack dogs, they love the company of other dogs, especially other English Foxhounds, and they're quite comfortable around horses. They generally do well with other animals, but with their strong prey drive, they may chase smaller pets. Supervise interactions with cats, smaller dogs, or other animals until you're sure everyone gets along.","English Foxhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 65 to 80 pounds; females 23 to 25 inches and 45 to 55 pounds.,"The English Setter should be affectionate, kind, and gentle. He's lively, as befits a sporting dog, but not so active that he'll exhaust you. An English Setter will bark to let you know someone is approaching the home, but he welcomes people that you introduce to him.Temperament doesn't happen in a vacuum. It's affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, English Setters need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your English Setter puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.English Setters work well with people, but because of their hunting heritage — which often involves them working well away from the hunter — they can be independent thinkers. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise.The English Setter who's treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Keep training sessions short, and always end on a high note, praising him for something he did well.","English Setters are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Setters will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Setters, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia (HD): This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, low energy levels, drooping of the eyelids, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Deafness: Deafness is fairly common and can provide many challenges for both the dog and the owner. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but usually deafness cannot be cured. Patience and time must be given to a deaf dog and there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you and your puppy. If your dog is diagnosed with hearing loss or total deafness, take the time to evaluate if you have the patience, time, and ability to care for the animal. Regardless of your decision, it is best to notify your breeder so he or she can take steps not to repeat that breeding.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful arthritis or lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain. Keeping your dog at a healthy weight also relieves pressure on his joints. How elbow dysplasia will affect your dog is difficult to determine as there are varying degrees of the disease.","The ideal situation for an English Setter is life in a house with access to a fenced yard where he can play. A fence will keep him from wandering off in search of birds or other prey. He'll appreciate a good half-hour run off leash in a fenced area or a walk or hike on leash. It's not unusual for English Setters to turn couch potato when they're about three years old, but they still need exercise to stay in shape.Puppies have different exercise needs. Their skeletal system is still developing and won't be mature until they're about two years old. Don't let them run or jump on hard surfaces, including jumping on and off furniture, and cover wood or tile floors with skid-resistant rugs so they don't slip and slide into walls or fall and injure themselves.Here's a good schedule for providing your Setter puppy with exercise. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for him to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. If you provide them with toys, they can keep themselves entertained quite well.From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet his needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Gradually increase the distance you walk.After he's a year old, your Setter pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.English Setter puppies are curious and active. Like any puppy, they will find and chew anything that's within reach. If nothing else, a puppy will teach you to keep your home picked up!Crate train your English Setter when he's young, and place him in his crate with a sturdy toy for entertainment when you can't be there to supervise him. That will keep him out of trouble and your possessions in one piece.They can also be difficult to housetrain, another instance in which a crate can come in handy. To successfully housetrain your English Setter, start early, keep him on a regular schedule, reward him with praise or a treat when he potties outside, keep playtime and potty time separate, and crate him when you can't supervise him.A puppy in a crate means no accidents in the house and no angry people cleaning up pee or poop. Never keep your puppy in the crate without a potty break for more than two to four hours.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The coat lies flat without any curl or woolliness. It's embellished with feathering — a longer fringe of hair — on the ears, chest, belly, underside of the thighs, backs of the legs, and on the tail: just enough to be pretty but not so much that it would impede the Setter's progress in the field.His colors — blue belton, orange or lemon belton, blue belton and tan, and liver belton hearken back to his English hunting heritage. Belton is a village where the breed's founder, Edward Laverack, liked to hunt. The coat is white with an intermingling of darker hairs all over the body.An English Setter with a blue belton coat, then, is white with black markings; orange or lemon belton, white with orange or lemon; blue belton and tan includes, natch, tan markings, making this dog a tricolor; and liver belton is white with deep reddish-brown markings. Puppies are usually born white, although some may have patches of orange, black, or liver.When he's properly groomed, an English Setter has a stunning coat. Brush him at least three times a week — daily is better — with a stiff bristle brush to keep the skin healthy and the coat shiny, and use a steel comb to gently remove any tangles or mats.A bath every six weeks or so will keep him smelling nice. Like all dogs, he sheds, but brushing will help keep loose hairs off your clothes and furniture. You may also want to trim stray hairs every six weeks for a neat appearance. If you're uncomfortable doing that, you can take him to a professional groomer or ask the breeder to show you how.Because his floppy ears block air circulation, check and clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Setter may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Setter's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Setter enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Setter to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","It's often more common to need to protect an adult English Setter from children than the other way around. He's tolerant and mellow and will put up with a lot — although he shouldn't have to!Because puppies and toddlers are both in the process of being civilized, they need close supervision to prevent any ear pulling or tail tugging on the part of either party. Many breeders prefer to sell puppies to homes where children are at least six years old and more able to control their actions. They recommend adult English Setters for homes with younger children.Whatever your situation, always teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.English Setters can do well with other dogs and animals, especially if they are raised with them. They are birdy, however, and you should protect pet birds until you're sure your Setter understands they're off limits. Some dogs can learn that fact, if they're taught from puppyhood, but don't assume that it will happen with every dog. You may always need to keep the two separated, if only so your Setter doesn't pull your parakeet's tail or your parrot take a bite out of your Setter's sensitive nose.","English Setters are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Be sure that you can provide your dog with adequate exercise or he may become nervous and destructive.Some English Springer Spaniels can demonstrate submissive urination, which means they pee in excitement or anxiety when you come home.

Field-bred Springers are generally a bit lighter than those bred for the show ring.,"The typical Springer is friendly, eager to please, quick to learn, and willing to obey. He should never be aggressive or timid. In recent years there have been reports of aggression or excessive timidity in the breed, as well as excessive separation anxiety. These traits aren't desirable and could be an indication of poor breeding. As with any breed of dog, it's important to research breeders and find ones who test their breeding stock not only for genetic diseases but also temperament.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization.

Most cases are mild and there is no detectable loss in vision. Veterinary ophthalmologists can do tests to determine if puppies are affected when they are 7 to 12 weeks old. Retinal dysplasia shouldn't affect a dog's ability to function as a companion, but affected Springers shouldn't be bred.Entropion: This is a condition caused by the lower eyelid folding inward toward the eye, resulting in chronic irritation of the surface of the eye. It can be corrected with surgery.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degeneration of the layers of the retina. The disease is progressive and eventually results in blindness. In Springers it's usually seen between 2 and 6 years of age. The disorder is still considered rare, but its incidence has increased. There is no treatment, but the condition doesn't cause pain or discomfort. Dogs who lose their sight can get along very well using their other senses. Just don't move the furniture around.Skin Disorders: Typical signs of skin disease include scaliness, greasiness, itching, pyoderma (infection), and occasional hair loss. There are genetic as well as other factors, such as allergies, involved in the development of skin diseases. Be sure to check with your vet if you notice any of the conditions listed above.Ear Infections: Because of their pendant ear flaps, ear infections are common in English Springer Spaniels. You may be able to prevent most ear infections by keeping the ears clean and dry. As your veterinarian for ear care products and if an infection occurs anyway, have your dog treated by your veterinarian.Phosphofructokinase (PFK) Deficiency: PFK is an enzyme that is needed for the body to use sugar for energy. Some Springers have an inherited deficiency of this enzyme. Signs may be so mild that they go unrecognized for years, but some dogs have severe illness, including hyperventilation, muscle wasting, and fever. Your vet can test for the deficiency measuring the PFK enzyme through a blood sample.","English Springer Spaniels are loving, devoted dogs who can live comfortably in most homes as long as they get plenty of daily exercise.The amount of exercise your adult Springer needs depends; Field Springers need more than Show Springers. If you have a fenced yard or acreage where he can play, your Springer will enjoy being outdoors with you while you garden or read or grill dinner. He'll run around on his own, then check in with you every few minutes, just as he might do in the field with a hunter.

Their medium-length topcoat is flat or wavy, and the undercoat is short, soft, and dense. Together, they're waterproof, weatherproof, and thornproof. They have a fringe of feathering on the ears, chest, legs and belly. A healthy Springer coat is clean and shiny.English Springer Spaniels come in several color combinations. Perhaps best known are the Springers with black or liver (deep reddish-brown) with white markings or primarily white with black or liver markings. Some are blue or liver roan. Blue is a dilution of the black coat, and roan describes a fine mixture of colored hairs with white hairs.Tri-color Springers are black and white or liver and white with tan markings, usually on the eyebrows, cheeks, inside of the ears, and beneath the tail. Sometimes the white parts of the coat are flecked with ticking, small, isolated areas of black hairs. Springers bred for the show ring usually have more color than white, whereas field Springers tend to have more white so hunters can see them easily in the field.Brush your Springer at least three times a week to keep him looking his best and to avoid mats, or tangles. Springers shed moderately all year long, and regular brushing will also help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture.You may also want to trim around the head, neck, ears, tail, and feet, just to give your Springer a neater appearance. Many English Springer Spaniel owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every two to three months for trimming.Because his floppy ears block air circulation, they must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections.

It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of Patellar Luxation ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA): Patent Ductus Arteriosis, or PDA, is a common congenital heart disease that is found in many different breeds. It occurs when the ductus arteriosis, a large vessel or shunt that causes an unborn puppy's blood to pass through the heart and bypass the lungs, fails to close after birth. When that happens, fluid accumulates in the lungs, resulting in labored breathing, fainting, dizzy spells, coughing, heart murmurs, collapse, and heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosis is repaired with surgery.Mitral Valve Insufficiency: Mitral Valve Insufficiency, also known as mitral valve disease or chronic valve disease, is most commonly seen in older dogs and occurs when the mitral valve, which is found between the left atrium and ventricle, begins to fail. When this happens, the mitral valve fails to prevent the flow of blood back into the left atrium. This can cause many devastating side effects, including heart failure. Signs of this disease are a heart murmur, fluid in the lungs, an enlarged heart, lack of energy, and a decrease of strength to the heart muscle. It can be treated for a time with medication, diet, and a restriction of exercise. It helps to keep your Charlie at a healthy weight and his teeth clean and healthy.Cleft Palate: The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the nasal and oral cavities. It is made up of two parts, hard and soft. A cleft palate has a slit that runs bilaterally or unilaterally and can range in size from a small hole to a large slit. A cleft palate can affect both the hard and soft palate separately and together and may cause a cleft lip. Puppies can be born with cleft palates, or a cleft palate can occur from an injury. Cleft palates are fairly common in dogs, but many puppies born with a cleft palate do not survive or are euthanized by the breeder. The only treatment for a cleft palate is surgery to close the hole, although not all dogs with a cleft palate require the surgery. It is important to get a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from your veterinarian.Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is when one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If the testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not medically treated. The treatment that is suggested is to neuter your dog. When the neutering takes place, a small incision will be made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner.Seborrhea: Seborrhea is a skin disorder that is categorized as two types: seborrhea oleosa (oily skin) and seborrhea sicca (dry skin). The signs of both are dry, flaky skin, a terrible ""doggy smell,"" and itching, and it is usually accompanied by other ear and skin infections. The causes of seborrhea can be metabolic disorders, allergies, internal and external parasites, and autoimmune diseases. Before treatment can begin, the underlying cause must be determined. Once it is, seborrhea can be treated quite easily with a change in diet, high quality shampoos and conditioners, and occasionally with medication.Retinal Dysplasia: Retinal Dysplasia is most commonly a congenital hereditary disease, meaning the dog is born with it and it was passed to him by his parents, but it can also result from trauma or prenatal herpesvirus or parvovirus infections. It can be mild or severe and is caused by an abnormal development of the retina, resulting in retinal folds. This can lead to a variety of vision problems for the dog ranging from a small blind spot to total blindness. Retinal dysplasia can be detected as early as six to eight weeks of age. There is no known treatment for retinal dysplasia, but many blind dogs live full lives, and their other senses compensate for the vision impairment.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Legg-Calve-Perthes disease affects the hip joint and results in a deformity of the hip joint ball. It starts with a decrease in the blood supply to the head of the femur bone until the bone eventually dies off and collapses and becomes deformed. The result of this deformation is arthritis or inflammation of the hip joint. It is unclear what causes Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. Dogs with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease may chew at the hip, move stiffly or painfully, develop progressive lameness, or seem irritable. Treatment is usually strict crate rest, physical therapy, and surgically removing the deformed femoral head and neck. Prognosis is generally very good after the surgery and many dogs suffer only minor lameness, particularly during weather changes.Hydrocephalus: When the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain accumulates either because of a congenital defect, obstruction, or the result of perinatal trauma, it places pressure on the brain. This usually occurs in young dogs under the age of 18 months and older dogs that are over 6 years of age. If hydrocephalus is left untreated the dog will die. The obstruction can be removed surgically or through insertion of a shunt.Umbilical Hernia: Umbilical hernia is a condition that is present at birth in which abdominal fat or internal organs protrude against the abdominal wall near the umbilicus. If the hernia is small, it can be left without treatment. Some small hernias close spontaneously by the time the puppy is 6 months old, and some dogs have lived with small hernias their entire lives without difficulty. Large hernias require surgery, which is often done when the dog is being spayed or neutered. Surgery is used to prevent a more serious condition where an intestine loop drops into the hernia causing life threatening ""strangulation"" of the intestine.Open Fontanel: English Toy Spaniels are born with a soft spot on the top of their head. Usually the soft spot closes, much like a baby's will, but sometimes one will not close fully. Of course, a dog should never be struck, but it's important to understand that even an accidental blow to that spot on the head could kill an English Toy Spaniel with an open fontanel.Fused Toes: Fused toes are a common trait in the English Toy Spaniel and should not be confused with any form of disease or disorders.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In English Toy Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","The English Toy Spaniel does not require extensive amounts of daily exercise. They generally exercise themselves at home and require only small walks around the neighborhood or a small game in the back yard. They are not ideal walking companions because they can suffer from joint problems, and long walks can aggravate any problems they may have.Training can be easy with this breed as long as you understand his nature. He is independent and may disregard commands when they are first given. Generally, they are happy to please and enjoy the companionship training provides. Leash training can be particularly difficult since they prefer being off leash, but it is important to keep your English Toy Spaniel on lead whenever he's not in a fenced area since he can be easily injured by other dogs. Housetraining an English Toy Spaniel can be an easy task as well, and many have been successfully trained to potty on paper when nightly walks or a yard are not available.Socialization is important with this breed since they can be very timid when they are exposed to new people or situations.Occasionally an English Toy Spaniel will stop eating and usually it will be his teeth that are bothering him. Keeping the teeth clean with regular brushing and veterinary cleanings will help prevent any problems.English Toy Spaniels do very well in apartments because of their low energy levels. They are companion dogs and should never be left outside or in a kennel. An English Toy Spaniel should be monitored in hot weather since their short muzzles makes them susceptible to heat exhaustion. It is recommended that they live in homes that have adequate ventilation and air conditioning and their outdoor time should be limited when it is hot and humid.","Recommended daily amount: 0.5 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your English Toy Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The English Toy Spaniel has an abundant coat that is long and straight to slightly wavy with a silky texture. Feathering should appear on all four legs and feet. Fringing should appear on the body, chest and ears.The coat comes in four color patterns: Ruby, a rich mahogany red, with or without a small white patch on the chest; Blenheim, a white base coat with large chestnut or red markings; Prince Charles, a tri-color consisting of a white basecoat with large black patches and tan markings over the eyes, under the tail and on the underside of the ears; and King Charles, a rich black with mahogany tan markings.The English Toy Spaniel requires little in the way of grooming. Give him a bath once or twice a month, using a high-quality shampoo to keep his coat silky. Comb him once a week to remove any dead hair or tangles, and wash his face daily to remove any ""sleepies"" from the eyes or food left on his face after a meal. English Toy Spaniels are considered to be average shedders.Clean ears regularly with a damp warm cloth and run a cotton swab around the edge of the canal. Never stick the cotton swab into the actual ear canal. You should also check ears, eyes and teeth for any discharge or bad smells. Both are signs that your Charlie may need to see the veterinarian.","English Toy Spaniels can be loving toward children, but they can become overwhelmed by the noise and stimulation young children create. This can lead to biting if they are handled roughly. English Toy Spaniels do very well with other pets, especially if they are raised with them.","English Toy Spaniels are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

The main colors of Eurasiers are black, black & tan, fawn, red, and wolf sable.Eurasiers are known to be fairly allergy friendly. They are easy to groom, and though they have thick fur, are easy to brush.Most Eurasiers eat in a controlled manner, not typically subject to overeating, and take food by hand in a very delicate manner—they are soft-mouthed.Eurasiers are very family-oriented dogs. They make good watchdogs, but they generally do not act aggressively to strangers.","The Eurasier, originating from a cross-breed of both Chow-Chow and Wolfspitz, is a large- to medium-sized breed, being more long than tall in stature.Most weight in the range of 40 to 70 pounds and range in height between 20 and 24 inches.","The Eurasier is a calm and even-tempered dog who sticks to a pack mentality. This means they are very family-oriented dogs. They're alert of their surroundings and ever watchful, which makes them great protectors of their pack or family.However, they are not usually aggressive towards others. Since they are family-oriented dogs, they typically like having someone with them most of the time. They also take their time when meeting new people and dogs, though they usually won't be outwardly aggressive towards them.These loyal pups get along very well with children and other pets, especially if they were raised with them.This dog breed has a very mellow personality in general and they enjoy a family environment where they are constantly with someone they are comfortable with. If not, they get anxious and depressed easily.The Eurasier's activity level is medium to fair. They enjoy daily walks but are not excessively active or energetic. They're intelligent and obedient, which makes it easy for them to learn new skills or tricks.","The Eurasier breed might be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Chow-Chow and Wolfspitz also face. While virtually most, if not all, are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkupsSome of the more common health problems Eurasier suffer from include:Hip dysplasiaPatellar luxationHypothyroidismEye problems.","Like all dogs, Eurasiers need regular veterinary check-ups to make sure they are healthy and that no underlying issues exist. Your vet can help you develop a care routine for your specific dog breed that will keep them healthy.As with many dogs who have thick coats, Eurasiers shed a lot. At least once or twice a year they go through heavy shedding that lasts about three weeks. To keep this under control, make sure to brush your dog and give them warm baths. Also, blow dry their coat thoroughly to remove any loose hair, but keep the heat setting on low to prevent burns.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking loudly against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.The Eurasier is not an overly active dog. In fact, many owners would describe their Eurasiers as lazy. A 30- to 60-minute walk once a day is plenty of exercise for this breed, though they will also appreciate some active playtime indoors or in the backyard, as well.","An ideal Eurasier diet should be formulated medium-sized breed with medium energy. Eurasiers are relatively light eaters, and can seem to be picky or reluctant to eat. They eat in a controlled manner, not typically subject to overeating, and take food by hand in a very delicate manner—they are soft-mouthed.As with all dogs, the Eurasier's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Eurasier's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Eurasiers coats are often a mix of their Chow Chow and Wolfspitz’ descendants coats and colors. The main colors of Eurasiers are black, black & tan, fawn, red, and wolf sable.A Eurasier coat is made of short, soft, and dense underlying hair, and medium-length, fluffy, and a bit rough overlying hair. The hair is longer on the buttocks, tail, back of the front legs, back of the head, neck (mane-like), and body. Eurasiers are known to be fairly allergy friendly. They are easy to groom, and though they have thick fur, are easy to brush.","Eurasiers are calm and even-tempered dogs, which makes them great with children of all ages, especially if they grow up with them. They are large- to medium-sized dogs and can usually deal with excited children, as they are also not aggressive. But Eurasiers are often reserved unless they know you and it will take time before they warm up to strangers. That said, it's best that children learn and understand how to properly approach and play with these dogs.When it comes to other pets, Eurasiers need time to get to know them. Though they are not aggressive or easily-provoked, they will remain reserved with dogs and other pets they don't know or aren't familiar with. But with proper socialization and time, they will eventually warm up to other pets if they are around them long enough.Again, Eurasiers can get along just fine with children, other dogs, and cats. It really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.","Because the Eurasier is still a relatively rare breed, it may be difficult to find a breed-specific rescue. However, you can always check with your local shelter, and you may want to try a rescue that caters to large- or medium- sized dogs.

They will share the fun by bringing the water to you also.They love to eat and will steal food when possible.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Give or take an inch, males stand 18 inches at the shoulder, females 17 inches. The average Field Spaniel weighs 37 to 45 pounds.","Field Spaniels are easygoing, sensitive, fun-loving, independent, and smart. They enjoy being with people, although they may be reserved when they first meet strangers. No Field Spaniel should ever be shy, fearful, or aggressive.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Field Spaniel needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Field Spaniel puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Field Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Field Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Field Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Ear Infections: Field Spaniels can be prone to ear infections because of their floppy ears. The ears trap moisture and should be regularly checked.Hip Dysplasia: A degenerative disease in which the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development. This disease is found in many breeds. Although it is a genetic disease that breeders screen for, it can be found in a puppy with parents free of the disease. When it is found in such a puppy, it is usually linked to environmental factors such as poor nutrition or too much weight gain during puppyhood.Allergies: Allergies are common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The treatment for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies.Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia (AIHA) is a life- threatening disease that causes the body to attack its own red blood cells. Signs of AIHA are jaundice; fainting; pale gums, lips and eye margins; dark tea- colored urine; lethargy; and a rapid heartbeat. When tested the blood will have a low red blood cell count. If AIHA is left untreated, it will generally result in death. Treatment can take months to years and usually involves the administration of the steroid prednisone and in some cases blood transfusions.Cancer: Dogs, like humans, can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancer, and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur with old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract.Ectropion: Ectropion is the rolling out or sagging of the eyelid, leaving the eye exposed and prone to irritation and infection such as conjunctivitis. If ectropion is severe the eye should be repaired surgically, but in mild cases no treatment is necessary.Epilepsy: The Field Spaniel can suffer from epilepsy, which is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be treated by medications but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of the hormone produced from the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. The more apparent signs are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels of energy, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires lifetime treatment. A dog that is having daily treatment can live a full and happy life.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. A reputable breeder will have dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist.","Moderately active indoors, Field Spaniels aren't recommended for apartment or condo living. They do best with a large yard to run in. With their strong hunting instincts, it's best that they have a securely fenced yard so they don't wander off into trouble.Locking this breed away in a kennel or chaining him in the yard with minimal human contact will make him neurotic. He does best when given a great deal of exercise with chances to run and explore. Just be aware that he has a tendency to follow his nose. He will also enjoy long walks on leash.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Field Spaniel in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Field Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Field Spaniel has a dense, water-repellent single coat, meaning there's no undercoat. His hair is moderately long and can be flat or slightly wavy. The chest, underbody, backs of the legs, and rear end are adorned with moderate feathering but not the masses of fur you might see on a Cocker Spaniel.The coat comes in black, liver, golden liver, roan, or any of those colors with tan points. Some Field Spaniels have a small amount of white on the chest or throat.Joy of joys, the Field Spaniel requires much less grooming than other spaniel breeds. The coat should be brushed regularly and bathed as needed.Brush your Field Spaniel's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Field Spaniel to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Field Spaniels are fond of children, but noisy roughhousing isn't their style. As with any breed, always supervise the interaction between Field Spaniels and young children to prevent any ear-tugging and tail pulling on the part of either party.","Field Spaniels are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They love to bark! Train them at an early age to stop barking on command, or hope that you have tolerant neighbors!Because Finnish Spitz are hunting dogs, they should never be turned out in unsecured areas. A fenced yard is a necessity.If left outside alone for too long, Finnish Spitz will bark at everything they see unless trained at an early age not to do so.Finnish Spitz take a long time to mature mentally, and can be rather silly and puppyish until they are three to four years old.Hunting dogs in general can be independent thinkers, which makes them appear to be stubborn at times. Finnish Spitz are no different. Learn the proper training methods and motivations, however, and you'll be pleased with your dog's intelligence and willingness to learn.Finnish Spitz generally are good with other pets in the household, but can be aggressive with dogs they don't know.This is a breed that tends to be aloof and suspicious of strangers. They aren't good guard dogs, but they will alert you by barking if someone approaches your home.Finnish Spitz love to eat, especially treats. Since they can be somewhat manipulative, they will try to get as many treats from you as possible and can become overweight. Try giving them a carrot or a low-fat treat instead.Never buy a Finnish Spitz from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees.

He may not be mentally and emotionally mature until he's three or four years old.Like every dog, Finnish Spitz need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Finnish Spitz puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Finnish Spitz are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Finnish Spitz will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Canine Hip Dysplasia. This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation occurs when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition. In severe cases, however, surgical repair may be necessary.Epilepsy. This seizure disorder can be managed with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with proper management of this disease, which can be hereditary or of unknown cause.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Finnish Spitz, you should expect to see the results of annual blood and urine tests for kidney function and abnormalities associated with protein-losing nephropathy, protein-losing enteropathy, renal dysplasia, and Addison's disease and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","Finnish Spitz have a lot of energy and high exercise needs. They aren't recommended for apartment dwellers or families who don't have the time and energy to give them a lot of exercise.If left alone in the backyard, a Finnish Spitz will probably engage in his favorite activity — barking! His next favorite activity will be hunting for prey, which can include digging for mice and other burrowing animals or chasing squirrels and birds. This is a breed that requires a knowledgeable, active owner and understanding neighbors.He prefers cooler climates and does well as an inside dog. When you take him for a walk in public places, such as parks, be sure to keep him on leash so he won't take off chasing something. Give your Finnish Spitz a couple of 30-minute walks daily to help him use up his energyTraining these independent, strong-willed dogs can be a challenge. They are best trained with a soft voice and touch. Their intelligence makes them become easily bored with repetitive training, so keep your training sessions short.Professional trainers say Finnish Spitz can be manipulative and too smart for their owners, so you need to be persistent and firm. If you stick with it, however, you'll be greatly rewarded by your dog's intelligence and aptitude for sports, such as obedience, agility, and rally.","Recommended daily amount: 1.75 to 2.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Finnish Spitz in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Finnish Spitz, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Finnish Spitz have a double coat. The undercoat is short, soft, and dense, topped by harsh guard hairs that are one to two inches long. The hair on the head and legs is short. The tail and back of the hind legs has the longest and most dense hair. Males typically have more coat than females, especially at their shoulders.The coat comes in shades of golden-red, ranging from pale honey to deep auburn. No matter what color, their coats should be clear and bright, not muddy. Because the undercoat is a paler color than the topcoat, the dog appears to ""glow"" when standing in the sun.The coat is a solid color, with white markings on the tips of the toes and a quarter-size spot or narrow white strip, ideally no wider than a half-inch, on the chest. A Finnish Spitz may also have black hairs along the lip line and sparse, separate black hairs on the tail and back. Puppies often have a lot of black hairs, which decrease as they mature. The nose, lips, and rims of the eyes are always black.With weekly brushing, Finnish Spitz stay exceptionally clean. Their coats aren't oily, so they typically don't have an odor. They shed heavily in the spring and fall, however, and will need additional brushing during that time to keep the hair from flying around.Bathe only as needed. The Finnish Spitz is a wash-and-wear dog, meaning that no trimming should be done except under the pads of the feet.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Finnish Spitz's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Finnish Spitz jumps up to greet you.Introduce your Finnish Spitz to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Finnish Spitz love children and will tolerate a lot, walking away when they've had too much. They're sturdy enough that they're not easily injured by toddlers whose motor skills aren't fully developed.That said, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Finnish Spitz get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they're raised with them, but they can be aggressive toward dogs they don't know. And pet birds might want to watch their back around them.","Finnish Spitz are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you're interested in adopting an adult Finnish Spitz who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Finnish Spitz Rescue OrganizationFinnish Spitz Rescue Club Organization  ","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Finnish Spitz.Finnish Spitz Club of America"

Flat-Coats only come in solid black or solid liver.The Flat-Coated Retriever is a high-energy dog who requires about 90 minutes of exercise a day. He makes an excellent jogging companion once he reaches physical maturity.Flat-Coated Retrievers mature at a slower rate than some other breeds and you will find that you are in possession of a rather large puppy for several years. This timeless puppy can be both a joy and a frustration. If you want a dog that is quieter and less puppy-like as an adult, you should look for another breed.Flat-Coated Retrievers enjoy human contact and will become destructive if they are left alone for too long. Routines help establish what the dog can expect and reduce their stress level.Flat-Coated Retrievers are not recommended for apartments.Training is a must with this breed as Flat-Coats are both joyous jumpers and, like all retrievers, orally fixated--that means they like to chew.Use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Keep training fun, interesting, and kind. With harsh verbal or physical treatment, Flat-Coats can become stubborn or stop responding altogether.Although he's highly affectionate, the Flat-Coated Retriever is not the best choice in homes with young children or fragile senior citizens. They are unaware of their strength and can hurt people with their exuberant jumping and roughhousing.Flat-Coated Retrievers will bark an alarm, but they are not a guard or watchdog in any way. They are more likely to greet intruders warmly, happily licking their hands and face, than they are to deter them.Flat-Coated Retrievers may eat their own poop, a habit known as coprophagy. Pick up poop as soon as possible if you don't want your Flat-Coat to snack on it.Flat-Coated Retrievers are considered to be a healthy breed in relation to other breeds but they do have a high rate of cancers.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",A male Flat-Coated Retriever is 23 to 24.5 inches tall at the shoulder; a female 22 to 23.5 inches. The average weight of a Flat-Coated Retriever is 55 to 70 pounds.,"Nicknamed the Peter Pan of dogs for his ever-youthful outlook on life, the Flat-Coated Retriever has many desirable qualities. He's smart, friendly, adaptable, and cheerful. He's also mischievous and exuberant, with a moderately high energy level. His exercise needs must be met for him to maintain the sweet, calm temperament that he's known for.This is a slow-maturing breed, which means that he'll act puppylike for several years beyond physical maturity. He's a bit of a ham and will always make you laugh, even if he's just disobeyed you. The Flat-Coat is sensitive and doesn't respond well to harsh training methods. He may react by becoming stubborn or simply refusing to do anything you ask until you soothe his hurt feelings.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Flat-Coats need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Flat-Coat puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Flat-Coated Retrievers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Flat-Coats will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Flat-Coats, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is considered to be hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors. According to the 1997 Flat-Coated Retriever Society of America health survey, CHD affected 9.4 percent of Flat-Coats reported.Malignant Histiocytosis: While this form of cancer is rare, it's the most common type of cancer seen in Flat-Coated Retrievers. It originates in the histiocytes, white blood cells found in the skin and loose connective tissue in the body. Malignant histiocytosis is treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation, but the prognosis is usually poor.Lymphosarcoma: This is one of the most common cancers seen in dogs and can be found in various parts of the body such as the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow. The cancer can be treated with chemotherapy.Hemangiosarcoma: This form of malignant cancer is found in the lining of blood vessels as well as the spleen. It can be treated with surgery and chemotherapy, but the prognosis is poor.Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don't suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this condition involves the knee (patella) slipping out of place, causing lameness. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis which is a degenerative joint disease. Patellar luxation can be mild or severe. Dogs with severe cases may require surgery.Gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as gastric torsion or bloat: This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.","The Flat-Coated Retriever is the perfect suburban or country dog. He has a moderately high energy level and is best suited to a home where he has many opportunities to run and swim. Expect to exercise him about 90 minutes a day, or two 45-minute walks, runs, or other vigorous activity such as playing fetch or training for agility or flyball.Flat-Coated Retrievers make wonderful jogging companions when they are trained properly and have reached maturity. Remember that jogging on cement or other hard surfaces can damage your dog's joints; it's best to run on grass or other soft surfaces.Go easy on puppies. They need approximately 5 minutes of exercise for every month of age per day. So if your Flat-Coat puppy is 4 months old, he needs about 20 minutes of exercise per day. Too much exercise can stress his still-growing joints.Your Flat-Coat shouldn't be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended, both as an aid to housetraining and to prevent your Flat-Coat from getting into things he shouldn't when you're not around to supervise.Your Flat-Coat is likely to have one habit you'll find disgusting: eating poop, known as coprophagy. The only foolproof way to avoid this is to pick up his stool and dispose of it immediately.Start training your Flat-Coat as soon as you bring him home. He's a quick learner and wants to please you. He's sensitive, though, and harsh verbal or physical corrections will cause him to shut down and stop working for you. Be kind and consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.","Recommended daily amount: 3.5 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Feathering on the ears, chest, front, backs of forelegs, underside of the tail, and the thighs is part of the coat's protective function and shouldn't be excessively long. On the neck, especially in males, is a mane of longer, heavier coat. The coat comes in solid black or solid liver, a deep reddish-brown color.Flat-Coated Retrievers are relatively easy to maintain and require only weekly brushing unless the dog is shedding. Then you'll probably want to brush daily to keep the amount of loose hair floating around under control. You can trim the ears, feet, belly, and tail tip for neatness. Bathe as needed.Brush your Flat-Coat's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Flat-Coat enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Flat-Coat to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Flat-Coats are great friends for active older children. They'll play for hours, whether that involves running, swimming, or chasing a ball. They can be overwhelming for toddlers, however, accidentally knocking them over with one whack of that ever-wagging tail.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Flat-Coats enjoy the company of other dogs and can learn to get along with cats, especially if they're raised with them. They might be a little too fond of pet birds, if you know what we mean.","Flat-Coats are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They're scrappy and will pick fights with other dogs, even those that are much larger than they are. Be sure to keep your Fox Terrier on leash when he's not in a secure area.Fox Terriers should not be trusted alone with non-canine pets unless they have been trained to get along with them.Fox Terriers are highly energetic and need about 30 to 45 minutes of vigorous exercise each day. If they don't get a chance to burn off their natural energy, they can become destructive or turn into nuisance barkers.While they're loyal to their families and love to play, Fox Terriers are too rough and energetic to play with young children.Fox Terriers are escape artists. They can jump higher than you might think and will dig holes or otherwise try to escape from their yards.Fox Terriers are a fairly rare breed.

Females are proportionately smaller and weigh 15 to 17 pounds.,"These dogs are alert, lively, and smart. They're also prone to mischief, being charming but sly. A Fox Terrier can outwit you, yet leave you laughing at his antics. Their vigilant nature makes them excellent watchdogs, but it also means they tend to be nuisance barkers. Outgoing and inquisitive, Fox Terriers are friendly toward people but don't hesitate pick a fight with other dogs. That means they're not great candidates for the dog park.Like every dog, Fox Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young.

Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.Deafness is often a problem with predominantly white dogs. Living with and training a deaf dog requires patience and time, but there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier. Because this is a hereditary problem, you should notify the breeder so he or she can make changes in the breeding program.Cataracts are an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Legg-Perthes disease is generally a disease of small breeds, and this condition — a deformity of the ball of the hip joint — can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward.Lens Luxation is when the lens of the eye becomes displaced when the ligament holding it in place deteriorates.

He really needs a securely fenced yard (think Fort Knox) where he can run off all that energy during the day. And don't count on an underground electronic fence to keep your Fox Terrier in the yard. The threat of a shock is nothing compared to the desire to chase what looks like prey — cats, rabbits, cars.Keep your Fox Terrier on leash when in unfenced areas. He has a strong hunting instinct and will chase anything that moves. He will also try to pick fights with other dogs, so he's not a good candidate for visiting dog parks. Early socialization is important to help prevent aggression toward other dogs.Give your Fox Terrier at least 30 to 45 minutes of vigorous exercise daily, as well as plenty of off-leash play in the yard to keep him tired and out of trouble.Although they're highly intelligent, they're also willful, so Fox Terriers can be challenging to train. Be patient and keep your sense of humor handy. They thrive on consistency and routine, so providing clear rules and enforcing them in a firm and positive way will produce the most progress.

The coat of the Wire Fox Terrier is also dense but wiry, reminiscent of the matting on a coconut — the ideal look is for the hairs to twist, making them look broken. The coat can be crinkly or have a slight wave.The hair should be so dense that you can't part it with your fingers to see the skin. At the base of these stiff hairs is the undercoat, which is short, fine, and soft.White was a prized color in both Smooth and Wire Fox Terriers, because it made it easier to spot the dogs when hunting. Today, breed standards — the written description of what a breed should look like — say white should be the predominant color in both Smooth and Wiry Fox Terriers. They can have black, tan, or black and tan markings. Heads usually are solid-colored, but the breed standard allows for markings on their faces, such as a half or split face, a blaze, or color only over the eyes and ears.Brindle, red, liver, or (in Wires) slate-blue markings aren't desirable in the show ring. Those markings don't affect any less of a good companion, but you shouldn't pay extra for them because they're ""rare.""Smooth Fox Terriers need only occasional brushing with a firm bristle brush to keep them looking neat. Regular baths aren't necessary — only when they roll in something gross. Wire Fox Terriers don't shed very much, but they should also be brushed regularly to keep their coats clean and odor-free.To get the coat texture Wire Fox Terriers are known for, the coat needs to be hand stripped — meaning the hair is plucked out rather than cut with scissors or clippers. This is a job that most people turn over to a professional groomer, although you can learn to do it yourself.Another option is to have your dog's coat clipped. You should know, however, that clipping the coat changes the wiry texture, making the coat feel soft, and may cause the colors to look pale.Give your Fox Terrier regular nail trims. If you can hear nails clicking on the floor, bring out the clippers. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Fox Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.","Fox Terriers are children at heart themselves and love playing with kids, but they're too active for a child younger than 6 or 7 years old. They play rough, and children's high-pitched voices and tendency to run can make them look like prey, inciting the Fox Terrier to bite in excitement. Fox Terriers can also be protective of their food and toys, which can cause problems.As with all dogs, always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party. Don't leave dogs and young children alone together.Fox Terriers may be fine with dogs or cats they've been raised with since puppyhood, but they're not the best choice for homes with pets such as rabbits, hamsters, and guinea pigs.

Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems.Brachycephalic Syndrome: This disorder is found in dogs with short heads, narrowed nostrils, or elongated or soft palates. Their airways are obstructed to varying degrees and can cause anything from noisy or labored breathing to total collapse of the airway. Dogs with brachycephalic syndrome commonly snuffle and snort. Treatment varies depending on the severity of the condition but includes oxygen therapy as well as surgery to widen nostrils or shorten palates.Allergies: Allergies are a common problem in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies.Hemivertebrae: This is a malformation of one or more vertebrae that causes it to be shaped like a wedge or triangle. This malformation can occur on its own or with other vertebrae malformations. Hemivertebra can cause no problems, or it can put pressure on the spinal cord. This can lead to pain, weakness, and or paralysis. There is no treatment for the condition unless there is spinal cord pressure.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up and slips in and out of place (luxates). This causes lameness or an abnormal gait (the way the dog moves). It is a congenital disease, meaning it's present at birth, although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): IDD occurs when a disc in the spine ruptures or herniates and pushes upward into the spinal cord. When the disc pushes into the spinal cord, nerve transmissions are inhibited from traveling along the spinal cord. Intervertebral Disc Disease can be caused by trauma, age, or simply from the physical jolt that occurs when a dog jumps off a sofa. When the disc ruptures, the dog usually feels pain and the ruptured disc can lead to weakness and temporary or permanent paralysis. Treatment usually involves nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) made specially for dogs. Never give your dog Tylenol or other NSAIDs made for people as they can be toxic. In some cases surgery can help, but it must be done within a day or so of the injury. You may also want to ask your veterinarian about physical rehabilitation. Treatments such as massage, water treadmills and electrical stimulation are available for dogs and can have excellent success.Von Willebrand's Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand's disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications.Cleft Palate: The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the nasal and oral cavities. It is made up of two parts, hard and soft. A cleft palate has a slit that runs bilaterally or unilaterally and can range in size from a small hole to a large slit. A cleft palate can affect both the hard and soft palate separately and together and may cause a cleft lip. Puppies can be born with cleft palates, or a cleft palate can occur from an injury. Cleft palates are fairly common in dogs, but many puppies born with a cleft palate do not survive or are euthanized by the breeder. The only treatment for a cleft palate is surgery to close the hole, although not all dogs with a cleft palate require the surgery. It is important to get a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from your veterinarian.Elongated Soft Palate: The soft palate is the extension of the roof of the mouth. When the soft palate is elongated, it can obstruct airways and cause difficulty in breathing. The treatment for Elongated Soft Palate is surgical removal of the excess palate.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Frenchies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","French Bulldogs do not need a lot of exercise. They have fairly low energy levels, although there are exceptions to every rule. To keep their weight down, however, they need daily exercise through short walks or play times in the yard. Many French Bulldogs enjoy playing and will spend much of their time in various activities, but they are not so high energy that they need a large yard or long periods of exercise. This breed is prone to heat exhaustion and should not be exercised in hot temperatures. Limit walks and active play to cool mornings and evenings.When training a French Bulldog, take into account that although they are intelligent and usually eager to please, they are also free thinkers. That means they can be stubborn. Many different training techniques are successful with this breed, so don't give up if a certain method doesn't work; just try a different technique. To pique your Frenchie's interest, try to make training seem like a game with lots of fun and prizes.It is important to crate train your French Bulldog puppy even if you plan to give him the freedom of the house when he reaches adulthood. Regardless of breed, puppies explore, get into things they shouldn't, and chew things that can harm them. It can be expensive both to repair or replace destroyed items and to pay the vet bills that could arise, so crate training benefits your wallet and your temper as well as your puppy's well being.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Frenchie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The coat of the French Bulldog is short, smooth, shiny, and fine. The skin is loose and wrinkled, especially at the head and shoulders, and has a soft texture.French Bulldogs come in a variety of colors, including fawn, cream, various shades of brindle — a coat patterned with specks and streaks of light and dark markings — such as black brindle and the striking tiger brindle, and brindle and white, known as brindle pied. French Bulldogs can be any color except solid black, liver (a solid reddish-brown with brown pigmentation on the lips and nose), mouse (a light steely gray), and black with white or tan.Run from any breeder who tells you that a particular color is rare and thus worth more money. Conversely, remember that you can't just order up a puppy of a particular color and gender. Having your heart set on a fawn female is a recipe for disappointment when the litter contains only cream and brindle males.French Bulldogs are fairly easy to groom and need only an occasional brushing to keep their coat healthy. They are average shedders. Begin grooming your Frenchie at a young age and teach your puppy to stand on a table or floor to make this experience easier on both of you. When you are grooming your Frenchie at any stage of life, take the time to check for any scabs, skin lesions, bare spots, rough, flaky skin, or signs of infections. You should also check ears, eyes and teeth for any discharge or bad smells. Both are signs that your Frenchie may need to see the veterinarian.Clean ears regularly with a damp warm cloth and run a cotton swab around the edge of the canal. Never stick the cotton swab into the actual ear canal. If the edges of the ears are dry, apply mineral or baby oil sparingly. The oil can also be used on a dry nose.French Bulldogs do not naturally wear their nails down and will need their nails trimmed regularly. This prevents splitting and tearing, which can be painful for the dog.Keep the facial wrinkles clean and dry to prevent bacterial infections. Whenever you bathe your dog, take the time to thoroughly dry the skin between the folds. Bathe your French Bulldog monthly or as needed, and use a high-quality dog shampoo to keep the natural oils in his skin and coat.French Bulldogs should be easy to groom, and with proper training and positive experiences during puppyhood, grooming can be a wonderful bonding time for you and your Frenchie. If you're uncomfortable with any aspect of grooming, such as trimming nails, take your dog to a professional groomer who understands the needs of French Bulldogs.","Frenchies get along well with children, and they're not so tiny that they can't live in a household with a toddler. That said, no dog should ever be left alone with a young child. It's just common sense to supervise and make sure that neither is poking or otherwise harassing the other.When they are socialized to them during puppyhood, Frenchies can get along well with other dogs and cats. Overly spoiled Frenchies, however, may be jealous toward other dogs, especially if those other dogs are getting attention from the Frenchie's very own person.","French Bulldogs are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

You should brush their teeth daily, as some breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal French Spaniel diet should be formulated for a medium breed with high energy. They might have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed and do not get enough exercise, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their number of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the French Spaniel’s dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your French Spaniel’s diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs—including weight, energy, and health—to make a specific recommendation.","The French Spaniel's coat is often brown and white, with brown shades ranging from cinnamon to dark liver.

Expect a healthy amount of exercise each day to curb negative behaviors.The German Pinscher can fare all right in an apartment as long as he's walked at least twice a day. However, he's better suited to a home that has a fenced yard.He has a strong prey drive and will chase anything that he deems worth chasing. He should be kept on lead while not in a secured area, and fences should be secure enough that he can't slip through them.The German Pinscher is a strong-willed breed that needs a consistent and firm owner. He has been known to take over a home if rules are not set when he's young. With training and consistency, however, the German Pinscher will learn quickly and well.Naturally suspicious of strangers, the German Pinschers makes an excellent guard dog. By the same token, he needs to be socialized from a young age to prevent the development of aggressive behavior.The German Pinscher enjoys jumping up to greet loved ones, but proper training can correct this trait.He will alert bark and he has a strong, loud voice, but he won't bark unnecessarily.He thrives when he's part of a family and can participate in family activities. He isn't a breed who can live outside, and he's unhappy being forgotten while life is busy.The German Pinscher can become destructive when he's bored. He's also known for his ability to gut toys at an alarming rate.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The German Pinscher is a squarely built, muscular, medium-sized dog. The average height is between 17 to 20 inches for both males and females.

With training and consistency, German Pinschers will learn quickly. Naturally suspicious of strangers, he is an excellent guard dog.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the German Pinscher needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your German Pinscher puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.He's like a mischievous kid who will test your boundaries. Sure, he'll housetrain quickly, and he's quite trainable in other respects as well, but he wants to know what he can get away with.You need mental and physical strength to control a German Pinscher and gain his respect.

Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred--so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.","German Pinschers are active and need daily exercise either through a good run in the backyard or two long walks on lead. Supervise your German Pinscher when exercising, since he'll go bounding off after anything that's worth chasing. He'll be all right in an apartment if given enough exercise, but he prefers a home with a fenced yard in which he can play. He isn't suited to living outdoors full-time in a kennel or dog run, however; he thrives being with his family.He's a working breed and enjoys having a job to do. An unstimulated, untrained, and unexercised German Pinscher can head down a scary path of boredom and destruction. Give him something to work on while you're gone, such as interactive toys or Kongs with frozen peanut butter. He's no couch potato, content to lounge about all day enjoying bonbons.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your German Pinscher doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. Like many other dogs, a German Pinscher can be destructive as a pup, and when even when he enters adulthood. Crate training is for his own safety. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap.Crate training at a young age will help your Pinscher accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Pinscher in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. He isn't meant to spend his life locked up in a crate or kennel.Exercise, training, and laying down house rules for your German Pinscher all will help ensure that your companion is well behaved.

If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your German Pinscher, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The coat should be shiny and smooth in texture, short and dense with no bald spots. The German Pinscher sports a variety of colors, including various shades of red, stag red (in which there are black hairs intermingled with the red), and Isabella (a light bay or fawn color). German Pinschers can also be black or blue with tan or red markings.The German Pinscher is an average shedder and requires minimal grooming. Brushing his coat with a cloth or rubber mitt about once a week will get rid of any excess hair.Brush your German Pinscher's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your German Pinscher to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The German Pinscher usually does well with children if he's brought up with them from puppyhood. But because of his assertive nature, he does best with older children, preferably those over the age of nine. An older Pinscher who's unfamiliar with children will probably do best in a home with kids who are mature enough to interact with him properly.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should be left unsupervised with a child.The same holds true for the German Pinscher's attitude toward some kinds of pets; he does best if he's been raised with them, or at least socialized to them when he's still young. But remember that he was developed to hunt and kill vermin. He's got a high prey drive that's hardwired, and no amount of training will keep him from going after a pet rat. He's not a good match with small mammals.","German Pinschers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They're reserved dogs; they don't make friends immediately, but once they do, they're extremely loyal. With their family, they're easy-going and approachable, but when threatened, they can be strong and protective, making them excellent watchdogs.This highly intelligent and trainable breed thrives on having a job to do—any job. The German Shepherd can be trained to do almost anything, from alerting a deaf person to a doorbell ring to sniffing out an avalanche victim.One thing they're not good at is being alone for long periods of time. Without the companionship they need—as well as exercise and the chance to put their intelligence to work—they become bored and frustrated. A German Shepherd who's under-exercised and ignored by their family is likely to express pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as barking and chewing.Like every dog, the German Shepherd needs early socialization—exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences—when they're young.

Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Golden Retrievers, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to get rid the excess air in their stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. They also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Degenerative Myelopathy: Degenerative myelopathy is a progressive disease of the spinal cord, specifically the part of the cord that communicates information to the brain regarding the hind legs. Dogs with DM act as though they don't know where their back legs are, and cannot move them properly. The disease progresses to the point the dog cannot walk. Most of the time, there is no treatment and the dog is put to sleep. However, in a few rare cases, the condition is related to a lack of vitamin-12 or vitamin E. If this is the case, vitamin supplements might stabilize the condition.Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency: EPI is a genetic disease of the pancreas in which the cells that produce digestive enzymes are destroyed. As a result, the dog can no longer digest and absorb food. The first signs of the condition are gas, loss of appetite, weight loss, and change in stools. The dog becomes very thin, and very hungry. EPI is diagnosed with a simple blood test, and treatment is simple, too: pancreatic enzymes are added to the dog's food. With proper medication supervision, most dogs recover.Allergies: Some German Shepherds suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact allergies to food allergies. Allergy symptoms in dogs are similar to those in people. If your German Shepherd is scratching, licking at their paws or rubbing their face a great deal, suspect that they have an allergy and have them checked by your vet.","Originally bred to herd flocks all day, German Shepherds are built for action. This means they've got lots of energy that they need to burn off with daily exercise.If you leave them alone for long periods of time without exercise, expect trouble. Boredom and inactivity lead to behavior problems—chewing, digging, and barking. The German Shepherd desperately needs to exercise both their body (jogging, a romp at the dog park) and their mind (training exercises like agility or obedience competitions).Like many herding breeds, German Shepherds are barkers. Barking isn't necessarily a problem, but it can be if the dog is bored. Learning the ""Quiet"" command should be part of every German Shepherd's obedience training.German Shepherds like to chew, and their powerful jaws can destroy most materials. If they pick the wrong thing to gnaw on, they can damage their teeth, swallow something that makes them sick, or even choke. Save your dog, and your belongings, by giving them safe chew toys and bones so they can entertain themselves when you're not playing with them.","A German Shepherd Dog diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your German Shepherd Dog and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.You'll need to take special care with feeding and exercising a German Shepherd puppy, however. German Shepherds grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.And don't let your German puppy run, jump, or play on hard surfaces like pavement until they're at least two years old and their joints are fully formed. It's fine for puppies to play on grass, though, and puppy agility, with its inch-high jumps, is okay.Overfeeding your German Shepherd and letting them pack on the pounds can cause joint problems, as well as other health conditions. Limit treats, keep them active, and serve them regular meals rather than leaving food available at all times.","The German Shepherd was originally bred to herd flocks in harsh climates, and their medium-length double coat fits the job perfectly, acting as protection the dog from rain and snow and resistant to picking up burrs and dirt.The coat types of the German Shepherd are as varied as their color. Some German Shepherds are longhaired. However, the ""ideal"" German Shepherd has a double coat of medium length. The outer coat is dense with straight hair that lies close to the body, and is sometimes wavy and wiry.The coat comes in variety of colors and patterns including black; black and cream; black and red; black and silver; black and tan; blue; gray; liver; sable; and white. The American Kennel Club doesn't recognize white as a color for this breed, however, and won't let white German Shepherds compete in conformation shows, although they're allowed in other competitions.Sometimes jokingly called ""German shedders,"" the breed sheds year-round, and generally ""blows""—sheds a lot of hair at once, like a snowstorm—twice a year. If you want a German Shepherd, be prepared for hair on your black pants, on your white couch, and pretty much all over the house.There's no magic solution to shedding, and we just have to accept it. However, brushing two to three times a week will help more of the hair come out in a brush, rather than on your furnishings. And a sturdy vacuum cleaner doesn't hurt either.Bathing the dog too often strips the coat of oils that keep it healthy, so start running the bathwater only if your dog really needs it. It shouldn't be that often; despite their notoriety as a shedder, the German Shepherd tends to be fairly clean and odorless.The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection, then wiped out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.German Shepherds love to chew, and the habit helps keep their teeth clean. Give them sturdy, safe dental chew toys or bones, and they'll be fighting tartar buildup as they gnaw, especially on the back molars. Brushing their teeth with a soft toothbrush and doggy toothpaste also helps keep gums and teeth in good shape.","If they're well-trained and have had plenty of exposure to kids, especially as a puppy, a German Shepherd is a great companion for children. In fact, some say they're a cross between a babysitter and a cop, both gentle with, and protective of, the children in their family.This is a big dog, though, capable of mistakenly bumping a toddler or small child. True to their reserved nature, they're not tail-wagging friendly with kids they don't know, but they're generally trustworthy.The German Shepherd can also live peacefully with other dogs and pets, as long as they're taught to do so from puppyhood. Introducing an adult German Shepherd to a household with other pets can be more difficult if the dog isn't used to getting along with other dogs or cats. You may need to hire a professional trainer to help, or get advice from the rescue organization if that's where you acquired the adult German Shepherd.","German Shepherds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many German Shepherds in need of adoption and/or fostering, and there are several breed-specific rescues across the country.Check out this list of German Shepherd Dog rescues organized by state.

They are not purebreds like their German Shepherd Dog or Labrador Retriever parents.The main colors of German Shepradors are black, white, red, cream, blue, and grey. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.While they are not a good choice of dog for allergy sufferers, their coats are pretty easy to care for. A good brushing per week will probably do the job.Many German Shepradors absolutely love to run and play in the snow. Their double coats also help to keep them cool during hot summer months.German Shepradors make excellent family companions and watchdogs. Protective in nature, they will alert when strangers approach.Like all Retrievers, the German Sheprador is mouthy, and they're happiest when they have something, anything, to carry in their mouthDo not leave them alone for long periods. They can easily become board, depressed, and frustrated, which will result in unwanted behaviors.","As the German Sheprador is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between German Shepherd and Labrador parents, you can expect the German Sheprador to be on the large side.Most weigh in at 60 to 95 pounds and range in height from 20 to 27 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger.","German Shepradors make excellent family companions and watchdogs. Protective in nature, they will alert when strangers approach. They may be aloof with people they aren't family with. However, once they befriend you, you have a friend for life.These pups hail from a line of two working parents. Their German Shepherd parents regularly work as military, police, and guard dogs, while their Labrador Retriever parents have jobs as hunting and guide dogs. German Shepradors like to work and need to have a job to do, whether big or small. Give them a sense of purpose, and this dog will earn their keep ten fold.They are highly trainable, and thrive on positive reenforcement. Do not leave them alone for long periods. They can easily become board, depressed, and frustrated, which will result in unwanted behaviors.","The German Sheprador mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the German Shepherd and Labrador Retriever also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems German Shepradors suffer from include:hip and elbow dysplasiadigestive issues (bloat and diarrhea)","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your German Sheprador's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.German Shepradors are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one hour long walk per day with several shorter walks mixed in. Hiking and other adventurous activities are also recommended.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your German Sheprador's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as this mixed breed is prone to tartar build-up.  Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a German Sheprador puppy. Don't let your puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until they're at least two years old and their joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, as is puppy agility with its one-inch jumps.Like all Retrievers, the German Sheprador is mouthy, and they're happiest when they have something, anything, to carry in their mouth. They're also a chewer, so be sure to keep sturdy toys available all the time--unless you want your couch chewed up. And when you leave the house, it's wise to keep your pooch in a crate or kennel so they can't get themselves into trouble chewing things they shouldn't. Crate and kennel training should start in puppyhood.","An ideal German Sheprador diet should be formulated for a large breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the German Sheprador's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Sheprador's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","German Sheprador coats are often a mix of their German Shepherd and Labrador Retriever parents' coats and colors. The main colors of German Shepradors are black, white, red, cream, blue, and grey. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.They usually have medium length, dense coats, and while they are not a good choice of dog for allergy sufferers, their coats are pretty easy to care for. A good brushing per week will probably do the job and bathing is recommended every few months with a mild shampoo. Too much bathing can strip the coat of its natural oils.Their double coats do shed quite a bit. You will definitely want a vacuum on hand. You will need it.

Many of these dogs absolutely love to run and play in the snow. Their double coats also helps to keep them cool during hot summer months. Keep in mind they are an indoor dog and need to live indoors.","The German Sheprador not only loves kids, they enjoy the commotion they bring with them. They'll happily attend a child's birthday party, and you can possibly even get them to wear a party hat. Like all dogs, however, German Shepradors need to be trained how to behave around children and vice versa.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.If a German Sheprador has had plenty of exposure to other dogs, cats, and small animals, and has been trained how to interact with them, they'll be friendly with other pets, too.

German Shorthaired Pointer,2,1,2,4,1,2,4,4,5,5,4,3,3,2,2,5,3,3,3,5,5,5,4,5,3,5,5,3,5,5,Sporting Dogs,"1 foot, 9 inches to 2 feet, 1 inch tall at the shoulder",45 to 70 pounds,12 to 15 years,"German Shorthaired Pointers are high-energy dogs. At least an hour of intensive exercise, preferably off-leash, each day is recommended. Without sufficient exercise, your GSP may become nervous and destructive.GSPs are people-oriented and don't like to be left alone for long periods of time without something to keep them busy. Since they are so intelligent, they will find something to keep them busy if you don't — usually getting into something that you don't want them to get into.Bored German Shorthaired Pointers can become escape artists, so you need at least a six-foot tall fence if you plan to leave them alone outside.GSPs bark at strangers and noises. They also are a bit reserved with strangers.Female GSPs typically are very protective of their puppies if they have a litter.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males are 23 to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 55 to 70 pounds. Females are 21 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.,"Smart, friendly, and willing, the GSP is enthusiastic in everything he does without being nervous or flighty. He doesn't like being left alone, however, and can develop separation anxiety. This is a house dog, not a yard or kennel dog. He'll love everyone in the family but may choose a special favorite. He's highly trainable.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, GSPs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your GSP puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.  ","German Shorthairs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all GSPs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In GSPs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. In mild cases, with proper diet and exercise the animal can lead a full and active life. In more severe cases, surgical correction may be required. Your veterinarian can x-ray your dog's hips for evaluation. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred.Cancer: This was one of the most reported health problems in a recent survey by the German Shorthaired Pointer Club of America. The types of cancers most often reported were mammary tumors, mast cell tumors, and lymphosarcoma.Lymphedema: A disorder in which valvular blockage of lymph flow or twisted lymphatic ducts cause tissues to swell from an accumulation of fluids.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your German Shorthair has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically.Von Willebrand's Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand's disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications.Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs like GSPs, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and the type of food given might be factors in causing this to happen too. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively, and retches without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it's recommended that dogs that develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.","GSPs aren't recommended for apartment dwellers. They are best suited to active people who have a home with a large yard surrounded by a high fence. German Shorthaired Pointers were bred to have energy and stamina to last all day in the field, so exercise is important for them. If they don't get enough exercise, they can become nervous and destructive. Expect to exercise them an hour or more each day. Your GSP will enjoy a strenuous hike, long walk, or a good game of fetch. Given enough exercise, GSPs make excellent house dogs. Because they are so curious and intelligent, it's a good idea to crate young GSPs when you aren't around to supervise so they don't get into mischief.GSPs work well with people, but because of their hunting heritage — which often requires them to work well away from the hunter — they can be independent thinkers. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The GSP who's treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Keep training sessions short, and always end on a high note, praising him for something he did well.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your German Shorthair in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your GSP, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The GSP has a short, thick, water-repellent coat that's slightly longer on the underside of the tail and the back edges of the rear end, known as the haunches. On the head, the hair is softer, thinner, and shorter.The distinctive coat is solid liver or a combination of liver and white. It can be ticked (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), patched, or roaned (a fine mixture of colored hairs with white hairs). For instance, a liver roan GSP has a deep reddish-brown coat lightened by white hairs.The GSP's smooth, short coat is easy to groom and doesn't shed excessively. Brush it weekly with a firm bristle brush and bathe only as needed. Rub your GSP's coat with a towel or chamois to make it gleam. Be sure to check your GSP's feet after he has been exercising or working in the field. Dry him thoroughly after hunting to prevent a chill. Examine the ears regularly for signs of infection, such as a bad odor, redness, or tenderness. If your GSP scratches frequently at his ears, he may have an infection.","German Shorthairs can do well with children if they're raised with them. They have lots of energy and make excellent playmates for active older children. They can be too rambunctious for toddlers, however. Adult German Shorthairs who aren't familiar with children may do best in a home with older children who understand how to interact with dogs.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.German Shorthairs can get along with other dogs, although some may be aggressive toward members of the same sex. Because they're hunting dogs, they may also be aggressive toward small furry animals such as cats or rabbits. They can become socialized to them if raised with them from puppyhood, but they may not extend the same courtesies to strange animals who intrude on their property.","German Shorthairs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Not all German Wirehairs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're buying or living with a German Wirehair.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Entropion: Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, which usually affects the lower eyelid on a dog. When present in a dog, it is usually found in both eyes. It causes an impairment of vision and irritates the dog's eyes. If your German Wirehair has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes or that the eyes seem to tear up frequently. Entropion generally occurs before a dog turns a year old but surgery should be held off until the dog reaches adulthood. The treatment is multiple surgeries, in a gradual process so that the dog is not at risk for Ectropion, which is a rolling out of the eyelid.Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don't impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they're bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results.Von Willebrand's disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood's ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.","The German Wirehaired Pointer was bred to hunt all day in the field and that's what he's happiest doing. Short of that, he requires plenty of daily exercise. He can be a mannerly housedog and thrives on human companionship. He can jump with ease, so keep him confined with a fence that's at least six feet high and can't be dug under or wriggled through. A covered dog run may be the best way to provide outdoor shelter.","Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The coarse, wiry coat is one to two inches long. The hair is straight and harsh and lies flat.In winter the undercoat is dense to provide effective insulation against the cold, but in summer it's barely visible. The Wirehair's beard and bushy eyebrows serve as more than decoration. They protect the dog's face and eyes from scratches and lacerations.Some German Wirehairs are born with a long, soft, silky, or woolly coat. It doesn't have the same properties as the wire coat and takes considerably more time and effort to care for.The German Wirehair coat comes in various patterns of liver and white: spotted, liver roan (a mix of reddish-brown and white hairs), spotted with roaning and ticking (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), or solid liver, which is described as a deep reddish-brown. The liver-colored head sometimes has a white blaze, but the ears are liver-colored.To match the coat, he has a liver-colored nose, lips, and spotting in the mouth. Genetically, a liver dog can't have a black spot, and a black dog can't have a brown nose. If you're offered a German Wirehair with a black coat or black pigmentation, you may not be getting the real deal.The dense, wiry coat of the German Wirehaired Pointer requires minimal grooming. It should remain clean with regular brushing. The coat sheds lightly year-round. Bathe him only as needed. Thanks to the water-repellent nature of his coat, he dries quickly after a bath or swim.Trim the nails routinely to keep them in good condition and to prevent toenail injuries. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long.Brush your German Wirehair's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your German Wirehair to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The German Wirehaired Pointer is a great companion for older children who can stand up to his size and energy level, but he may be overwhelming for younger children who are easily knocked down in play.Always supervise any interactions between a dog and children for the safety of both. A German Wirehaired Pointer does better with children when he is raised with them, but an adult Wirehair who's adopted into a family with children can learn to get along with them if properly introduced and supervised.He may be aggressive toward strange dogs, but if he's raised with them he gets along fine with other dogs and cats.","German Wirehaired Pointers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many German Wirehairs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They need a strong leader who can provide clear and consistent rules without resorting to physical force.Although they are a very affectionate breed, the Giant Schnauzer is not recommended for homes with young children because of their size and forceful behavior.Giant Schnauzers will make excellent guard dogs.Apartments are not suitable dwellings for Giant Schnauzers. They need a large fenced yard where they can play and run safely.Socialization is a must with this breed. They can be aggressive toward people, dogs, and other animals they don't know. They are naturally suspicious of strangers and need to become accustomed to experiencing new people and situations.Giant Schnauzers are companion dogs and should live indoors. They thrive when they are with the people they love.Giant Schnauzers require brushing one to three times a week. Their coats must also be stripped or clippered to remain neat looking.Giant Schnauzers are intelligent dogs who learn quickly and excel at a variety of jobs. Be firm and consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Giant Schnauzers will see and take advantage of any inconsistencies in your behavior.Never buy a Giant Schnauzer from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.",A male Giant Schnauzer stands 25.5 to 27.5 inches at the shoulder and weighs 60 to 80 pounds. Females are 23.5 to 25.5 inches and weigh 55 to 75 pounds.,"The Giant Schnauzer has the calm, loving temperament of a companion dog and the assertiveness, boldness and energy required of a guard and working dog.He takes his responsibilities seriously and is protective of home and family, willing to defend them with a fierceness that can be intimidating. This is a territorial dog who's distrustful of strangers, but when he's not needed as a guardian, he's a playful and affectionate companion.His intelligence can pose a challenge to the inexperienced trainer, however. Giant Schnauzers require consistent and firm guidance. Without it, they're quite capable of thinking for themselves and running the household the way they think it ought to be run.As with every dog, Giant Schnauzers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Giant Schnauzer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Giant Schnauzers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Giant Schnauzers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): is usually found in the elbows but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. This disorder causes a painful stiffing of the joint where the dog will be unable to bend its elbow. It is caused by an improper growth of cartilage in the joints and can be hereditary, caused by trauma or improper diet. It can be detected in dogs as young as five to seven months of age. Although it is a genetic disorder, some research has linked high-protein diets to increasing the severity of this disorder.Autoimmune Thyroiditis: This is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in dogs and is recognized as a heritable condition. The disease tends to become evident at two to five years of age. Dogs may be clinically normal for years, only to become hypothyroid at a later date. Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Squamous Cell Carcinoma: This cancer may occur on a toe or toes of dark-haired dogs, including Giant Schnauzers. If your Giant Schnauzer shows signs of lameness for no apparent reason, have your vet take a look at his toes. Removal of the affected toe before the cancer spreads to the chest cavity increases the chance of survival.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Giant Schnauzers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","Giant Schnauzers are not recommended for apartments or condos. They have high energy levels indoors and out, and are best suited to a home with a fenced yard where they can safely run off some of that energy. When they're not playing outdoors, Giant Schnauzers should be inside with their people, whom they will happily follow around the house.Giant Schnauzers require at least an hour of daily exercise. Plan on a couple of half-hour walks at a good clip or vigorous play. He can be a digger or chewer, so always give him something constructive to do instead.This is a breed that needs a job. Train him to do tricks or help you around the house if you want to forestall destructive behavior. He doesn't like to be bored, so avoid frequent repetition and turn training into a challenging game to get the best out of him.Train him with firmness and consistency. He can be stubborn and you must be more stubborn. You must be able to provide leadership without resorting to physical force or harsh words.It's best if you work with a trainer who's familiar with and understands the breed. Your Giant Schnauzer will respond with enthusiasm to training techniques that are positive and keep him on his toes.","Recommended daily amount: 3 3/8 to 4 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Giant Schnauzer in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.Giant Schnauzers can be prone to gastric torsion and should be fed two or three small meals per day to avoid any build up of gas.For more on feeding your Giant Schnauzer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Giant Schnauzer's outer coat is wiry, hard, and dense, with hairs that stand up from the skin. Beneath it is a soft undercoat. On his face are a harsh beard and eyebrows, the Schnauzer hallmark.The coat is solid black or pepper and salt. The pepper-and-salt coloring is a combination of black and white hairs, and white hairs banded with black. At a short distance, the pepper-and-salt coat appears gray.The Giant Schnauzer's double coat requires brushing with a stiff bristle or slicker brush about three times a week to prevent mats from forming in the undercoat. Wash his face after every meal.A Standard Schnauzer's coat usually must be hand-stripped every 4 to 6 months. Hand stripping is necessary if you show your dog or like the look and feel of the proper coat, but pets can be clippered instead.Be warned, however, that if you clip your Schnauzer's coat instead of stripping it, eventually the texture will change. It will feel very soft and may shed more. Clippering can also cause a pepper-and-salt coat to look solid silver or solid black, depending on the color of the undercoat.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Giant Schnauzer's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Giant Schnauzer jumps up to greet you.Begin getting your Giant Schnauzer accustomed to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Because of their size, energy level, and commanding nature, Giant Schnauzers are not recommended for homes with young children. The suggested age range is 12 and older who have the maturity to interact appropriately with a large-breed dog.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Giant Schnauzers don't tend to be buddy-buddy with other dogs, especially those of the same sex, and they probably shouldn't be trusted alone with cats, no matter how well they seem to get along.","Giant Schnauzers are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you're interested in adopting an adult Giant Schnauzer who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Giant Schnauzer Rescue NetworkValley of the Sun Giant Schnauzer RescueSouthern California Giant Schnauzer Rescue, IncOntario Giant Schnauzer RescueHT-Z Giant Schnauzer Rescue","Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Giant Schnauzer.Giant Schnauzer Club of America, Inc."

Canine sports such as agility are a great way to let them burn off energy, but a brisk 30-minute walk around the neighborhood will do the trick, too.Originally bred to pursue their prey underground, the Glen was designed to dig and still has that drive today. If you want to save your flowerbeds, it's wise to train your Glen to use a designated digging area in the yard.Glens enjoy playing and roughhousing and can be wonderful companions for children, although they're strong and rambunctious enough to knock over small or young kids.Although they're not known to be barkers, the Glen will bark a lot if you accidentally encourage him. Don't run over to a barking Glen to see what the fuss is about — you'll teach him that if he makes a ruckus, he gets your attention. Teaching the ""quiet"" command is also helpful.The Glen can be aggressive to other dogs and needs plenty of time with other canines to learn how to get along with them, ideally beginning in puppyhood. Puppy kindergarten classes that give the pups time to play with each other, in addition to the obedience training, are an excellent way to help your dog hone his canine social skills.His strong prey instinct makes the Glen a poor fit for homes with other small pets that he may consider prey, such as cats, rabbits, and hamsters. It also means you'll need to teach him good leash manners, so he doesn't drag you halfway down the block when he spots something he wants to chase.The Glen was bred to be a hunter of small animals and has a strong inborn drive to chase. If you've got a yard, you'll want a sturdy fence to keep your Glen from taking off after anything that wanders by that looks like prey.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Males and females stand 12.5 to 14 inches tall, and weigh approximately 35 pounds.","The phrase ""large dog in a small body"" aptly describes this terrier. He's brave and feisty and, although he rarely starts a fight with other dogs, he's most likely to finish it. He will also protect his family if the need arises.He's intelligent, loyal, and patient, traits that can make for a wonderful companion dog. As a family pet he gives his people plenty of affection, but he's got an independent streak that's led many people to label him stubborn.","Glens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Glens will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Glens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Glens are also prone to progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative eye disorder involving the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. It causes a gradual loss of vision and eventual blindness. Vets can detect PRA years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. If you're buying a puppy, look for a reputable breeder who has her dogs' eyes tested and certified on a yearly basis.","The Glen is fairly low-maintenance. He enjoys the company of his human companions, and does best living in the house with them.Training is generally easy with this breed since he's intelligent and enjoys learning. The key to making training a breeze is to keep it fresh and interesting; do not bore the Glen with repetitive training. When bored, he'll show his stubborn streak by ignoring you, playing around, or wandering off to sniff his surroundings.The Glen is not an overly noisy breed, but if you accidentally encourage him, he'll bark and bark and bark. Don't ever run over to see what the fuss is about when he barks — you'll teach him that if he makes a ruckus, he'll get the attention of his favorite person. Teaching a ""Quiet"" command as part of his basic canine manners is a good idea.The Glen needs daily exercise; a brisk, 30-minute walk in the neighborhood will satisfy his need to move. Glens give themselves plenty of exercise too, playing and romping around the house. The breed can be just as happy in an apartment as in a home with a large yard.One word of caution: the Glen, like many other terriers, enjoys — no, loves — digging, and this trait isn't as easy to deter as barking. You can save your flowerbeds by training your Glen to dig only in one designated spot in your yard.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The coat comes in several shades of wheaten, from cream to red; any shade of blue, from silver to slate; and brindle, a tiger stripe-like pattern that mixes one dominant color with darker streaks or patches. The Glen is considered to be a non- to low-shedding breed.Grooming the Glen is easy. This isn't a fussy breed, and there's no need to make too much fuss over his coat. Brushing once or twice a week keeps the coat from tangling, and a bath every three months or so — or whenever he's rolled in something smelly — keeps it clean.Glens who compete in the show ring have trimmed coats, but it's fine to let a family dog go au naturel. Show Glens aren't trimmed with clippers, like other breeds, but stripped — the coat is thinned and shortened with a sharp, comb-like tool called a stripping knife. Stripping helps Glens maintain the coarse coat that show judges like to see in terriers.Brush your Glen's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Glen enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Glen to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Glen is a great family pet, playful and kind with children. He's an extremely strong and muscular terrier, though, and can play too rough for very young and small children.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.If he's spent plenty of time around other dogs, especially in puppyhood, the Glen can get along with other canines. He does have a strong personality, however, that can lead to quarrels. And because he was bred to hunt small prey, the Glen isn't recommended for homes with small furry pets that are allowed to roam free. He'll chase, and possibly kill, cats, mice, gerbils, hamster, rabbits, and other small animals.",Glens are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They are not purebreds like their Golden Retriever or Siberian Husky parents.Goberian coats commonly come in colors including white, black, gray, brown, and cream, and the coat is usually a mix of two or even more colors.Their fur is straight or wavy, and their double coat is ideal for cold climates. They are not well suited for hot climates.Goberians have high exercise needs and may overeat. It's important to stick to proper exercise and diet to prevent weight gain.These dogs need lots of physical activity. Owners must usually walk them for twelve miles or more each week.Goberians love their human families, even children, and are quite protective. They make great watchdogs.","The Goberian is usually described as a large-sized dog--although with all newer dog breeds, the exact size standards may vary.Most weigh in at 45 to 90 pounds and range in height from 20 to 24 inches.","There's a lot of independence going on in the Goberian's heritage, but in general, this breed likes to be around people and displays very social and friendly characteristics. If you're looking for any sort of a watchdog, the Goberian is loyal and very alert--this breed will let you know when strangers approach.Outdoor space is essential for the Goberian's lifestyle. The dog is super energetic and very active--hiking up steep trails, running along during a jog, and playing at the dog park for extended sessions are all going to need to be part of the Goberian's routine. At times, you might feel like you're struggling to keep up with your dog!Goberians have a reputation for being smart, but if your dog inherits more Siberian Husky than Golden Retriever, you might be dealing with a more stubborn and independent dog than anticipated. But patience and positive reinforcement works wonders on this breed--and it's worth it to experience one of the true stars of the dog world!",Goberians are generally considered to be healthy dogs--although the breed can suffer from issues and ailments inherited from its parent breeds.Some of the more common health problems Goberians suffer from include:BloatEpilepsyHeart issuesVon Willebrand's DiseaseOsteochondritis dissecans,"Just like with any dog, it's important to keep up your Goberian's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Due to their high exercise needs, be alert that your Goberian could develop health problems due to overeating and insufficient activity. Monitor meals and make sure you stick to a regular exercise regimen that involves walking or running over twelve miles each week.Make sure to brush your Goberian's teeth three times a week to lessen the likelihood of dental issues. Once a week, wipe down the breed's ears to stave off any potential infections. Also check that the dog's nails are clipped regularly--ask your vet to recommend a precise schedule. As the Goberian is such an active and outdoors dog, periodically look over their paw pads to make sure they're in good condition and not damaged.","An ideal Goberian diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with high energy.Goberians need to stick to a heathy diet as overeating can cause weight gain--especially if they do not receive the high levels of exercise they crave.As with all dogs, the Goberian's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Goberian's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","The Goberian's coat commonly comes in colors including white, black, gray, brown, and cream, and the coat is usually a mix of two or even more colors.This breed's coat is long and dense.

Being that the Goberian spends a lot of time outside, bath times should be taken as needed.The Goberian's double coat is ideal for cold climates. The amount of insulation provided by the coat means that this breed does not do well in hot environments. This is a dog that's going to drink a lot of water during the summer!","Family is important to the Goberian, and this mixed breed is great around children. If you teach your kids to interact with the dog in a respectful and appropriate way, they will be able to enjoy joint play sessions together in the family yard or at the park--just make sure they are supervised due to the Goberian's athletic abilities.In general, Goberians are great around other pets, although you should always exercise caution before introducing new pets to each other.As with all dogs, early socialization pays off, so make sure to reward your Goberian for good behavior and use positive reinforcement, rather than yelling or scolding, to bring the best out of this excellent and eye-catching breed.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Goberians because they are a mixed breed.

Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dysplasia is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication and weight loss to control the pain.Cataracts are an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Diabetes mellitus is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Blood sugar levels are regulated in part by insulin, which is produced in the pancreas. Glucose (sugar) is needed by the cells of the body to burn for energy; insulin is the key that lets the glucose into the cell. Without insulin, the glucose cannot enter the cell, so the cells are hungry even though there are high levels of glucose circulating in the blood. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate, but he will lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Signs of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and daily insulin injections.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Before purchasing a Goldador, it's important to research the health concerns that occur with both the Labrador Retriever and the Golden Retriever. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, heart, and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.","The ideal home for a Goldador is a house with a fenced yard where he can play safely; however, he can do well in an apartment or condo if he gets daily walks or runs. Either way, exercise is very important for a Goldador's health and happiness — at least 30 minutes per day is ideal. Interested in dog sports? Goldadors make formidable competitors in agility and flyball.Mental stimulation is crucial as well. Teach your Goldador to fetch the paper or your slippers, practice obedience training regularly with him, and put his mind to work from time to time with an interactive dog toy.As with all dogs, positive reinforcement techniques (praise, play, and food rewards) work best with the Goldador. He's sensitive, and harsh corrections will damage his confidence.","Recommended daily amount: 3.5 to 4.25 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference-the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Goldador, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","A Goldador should have the same double coat as a Labrador Retriever, with a short, thick, straight topcoat and a soft, dense undercoat (some have a slight wave down the back). Generally, a Goldador's coat color ranges from yellow to gold to reddish gold, but because the Goldador is a crossbreed, he may inherit the black coat of a Lab parent.Weekly brushing with a rubber curry brush will remove dead hair, helping to keep it off your clothes and furniture. During seasonal shedding periods, however, daily brushing is recommended. Bathe your Goldador as needed, and be sure to give him a thorough freshwater rinse any time he goes swimming.The Goldador can be prone to ear infections, so check and clean the ears weekly. Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Goldador's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Goldador jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Goldador to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently - dogs are touchy about their feet - and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Goldadors are an ideal family companion and are generally gentle and loving toward children of all ages. As puppies, they can be a bit rambunctious and may knock over smaller children unintentionally, so close supervision is important. Social and easy-going, Goldadors do well with other dogs and pets, especially when raised together.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.","There are no official rescue groups for the Goldador, but this cross is frequently available at private and municipal animal shelters. If you're interested in adopting an adult Goldador who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, your local animal shelter is a good place to start.",not available

Daily brushing will get some of the loose hair out of the coat, keeping it from settling on your clothing and all over your house. But if you live with a Golden, you'll have to get used to dog hair.Golden Retrievers are family dogs; they need to live indoors with their human ""pack,"" and shouldn't spend hours alone in the backyard.Golden Retrievers are active dogs who need 40-60 minutes of hard exercise daily. They thrive on obedience training, agility classes, and other canine activities, which are a great way to give your dog physical and mental exercise.Although they're gentle and trustworthy with kids, Golden Retrievers are boisterous, large dogs that can accidentally knock over a small child.Goldens love to eat, and will quickly become overweight if overfed. Limit treats, measure out your dog's daily kibble, and feed him in regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time.Because the Golden Retriever is so popular, there are many people breeding Goldens who care more about making money out of the demand for puppies than in breeding happy, healthy dogs. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Males are 23 to 24 inches tall and weigh 65 to 75 pounds. Females are generally 21.5 to 22.5 inches tall and 55 to 65 pounds. Golden Retrievers usually reach their full height by one year of age, and their mature weight by two.","A sweet, calm nature is the hallmark of the breed. The Golden was bred to work with people, and is eager to please his owner. Though hard-wired with a good disposition, like all dogs the Golden must be well-raised and well-trained to make the most of his heritage.Like every dog, the Golden needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Golden puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Goldens are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Goldens will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Goldens, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain.Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don't impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthamologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they're bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis: This heart problem is caused by a narrow connection between the left ventricle (out-flow) and the aorta. It can cause fainting and even sudden death. Your vet can detect it and prescribe the proper treatment.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.Allergies: Golden Retrievers can be allergic to a variety of substances, ranging from food to pollen. If your Golden is licking his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, have him checked by your vet.Von Willebrand's Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood's ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand's disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Golden Retrievers, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, or drink large amounts of water or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die.Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a brain disorder that causes periodic seizures and convulsions. Your vet will need to know how severe the seizures are and how often they occur to determine what medication to prescribe, if any.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland that's thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It's treated with medication and diet.Hemangiosarcoma: This is a very dangerous form of cancer that originates in the lining of blood vessels and spleen. It most commonly occurs in middle-age and elderly dogs.Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone cancer that's common in large and giant breeds.","Golden Retrievers are built for action and love outdoor romps. If you like to hike or jog, your Golden will be happy to join you. And if you feel like tossing a ball in the backyard, they'd be more than happy to join you; true to their name, Goldens love to retrieve.Tiring them out with 20-30 minutes of vigorous exercise twice a day will keep your dog mellow when he's back inside. Slacking on the activity, however, could lead to behavior problems.Like other retriever breeds, Goldens are naturally ""mouthy,"" and they're happiest when they have something to carry in their mouths: a ball, soft toy, newspaper, or best of all, a smelly sock.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Golden puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. Don't let your Golden puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until he's at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Some breeders have begun selling ""rare white Goldens,"" but the American Kennel Club does not recognize white as a coat color for the breed.Golden Retrievers shed moderately in the winter and summer, and heavily in the spring and fall. If you live with a Golden, you'll need to adapt to a certain amount of dog hair in your house and on your clothes.The Golden's thick coat means lots of grooming. Daily brushing is recommended to prevent tangling, and once a week is the bare minimum. Your Golden will also need a bath at least once a month, often more frequently, to keep him looking and smelling clean.Brush your Golden's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Fold-over ears create a warm, dark environment for bacteria or fungus to grow in, and breeds that have them — such as the Golden — are prone to ear infections. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. Check them every time he gets wet, too. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Golden to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early. ","The amiable Golden Retriever isn't bothered by the noise and commotion of kids — in fact, he thrives on it. He's a large, strong dog, though, and he can easily knock over a small child by mistake.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Golden's attitude toward other pets is the more the merrier. He enjoys the companionship of other dogs, and with proper introductions and training, can be trusted with cats, rabbits, and other animals.","Goldens are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

If you're interested in a Goldendoodle puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren't as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don't know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog.The Goldendoodle is the result of Poodle to Golden Retriever breedings. So far there are very few multigenerational breedings (crosses between two Goldendoodles).The Goldendoodle is considered to be a non- to light shedder, but he requires regular grooming and clipping. If the coat is kept short, it should be clipped every six to eight weeks and brushed every few weeks. If the coat is kept in its natural state, it should be brushed once every week or two.The Goldendoodle is not a watch dog, and he's generally not known to be noisy. He may not bark even if someone knocks on the door.Although he's got an average energy level, the Goldendoodle is not recommended for apartments. He does much better in a home with a fenced yard.The Goldendoodle requires about 20 to 30 minutes of daily exercise.Being a wonderful family companion, the Goldendoodle generally gets along well with children and does well with other dogs and family pets.The Goldendoodle is a very social dog who should not live away from his family. He's are not suited to living in a kennel or outside; he wants to be in the house.The Goldendoodle can suffer from separation anxiety if left for long periods at a time.The Goldendoodle may make an excellent companion to people with allergies.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Goldendoodles vary in size. This is because, at this stage, they're rarely the result of multigenerational breedings (in which one Goldendoodle is crossed with another), and there are no breed standards that Goldendoodle breeders are aiming for.However, the Goldendoodle tends to come in three different sizes: Miniature, Small Standard, and Large Standard.The Miniature Goldendoodle is the result of a Miniature or Toy Poodle crossed with a Golden Retriever. These dogs tend to range in size from 13 to 20 inches in height and 15 to 35 pounds in weight.The average height for a Small Standard Goldendoodle is 17 to 20 inches; the weight is 40 to 50 pounds.The Large Standard Goldendoodle averages 20 to 24 inches in height and weighs 50 to 90 pounds.","The Goldendoodle has not become popular for lack of good reason. His positive personality traits are numerous — he endears himself to everyone he meets with his friendly, intelligent, accepting nature.Usually highly affectionate, he's gentle and patient and makes a wonderful family companion, especially since he actively enjoys human company. He is loyal and, with proper training, can be highly obedient. He does have a playful side and can be mischievous if the mood hits.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Goldendoodle needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Goldendoodle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Goldendoodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions.

Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Ear Infections: These can be a problem for Goldendoodles because of their floppy ears, which trap moisture. Check and clean the ears regularly.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition (though it's also sometimes triggered by malnutrition) in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this condition is also a degenerative disease. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Goldendoodle is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as large Goldendoodles. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.","The Goldendoodle can be easy to train. Intelligent, he's usually eager to please — a perfect combination for either first-time trainers or experienced trainers. He should be trained with positive reinforcement, since harsh corrections could damage his confidence.Socialization is important for all breeds, but for a gentle dog like the Goldendoodle it can be instrumental in discouraging any shyness or timidity.The Goldendoodle has an average energy level and will require daily exercise through walks or a good romp in the back yard. Generally speaking, 20 to 30 minutes of daily exercise will be enough to keep a Goldendoodle from becoming bored. He's known for his love of water, so swimming provides another opportunity for appropriate exercise.Since the Goldendoodle may grow large, he does require room to move. He's not recommended for apartments but should have a home with some type of fenced yard. He's not an ideal pet for outdoor or kennel living, since he thrives when he's with his family, so owners should expect to keep him primarily in the house.The Goldendoodle can also suffer from separation anxiety, which can lead to destructive behavior, if he's left alone for long periods at a time.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 4 cups (depending on adult size) of high-quality dry food a day, divided into multiple meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

He has longer hair on the tail, body, ears, and legs (legs may be slightly feathered); the hair on the head and muzzle tends to be shorter.The coat can be black, copper, white, cream, gray, golden, apricot, or red, although golden seems to be the common coat color. White can often be found on the feathering, and the Goldendoodle's coat tends to lighten with age.Although he's considered a non- to light shedder, the Goldendoodle still requires some grooming to keep his coat in the best shape possible. Owners generally opt to clip the coat for easier maintenance; but if you choose to leave it in its natural state, expect to brush it about once every week or two. If he's clipped, he'll still need a good brushing every few weeks.The Goldendoodle requires a bath only when it's absolutely necessary, or his coat and skin will lose necessary oils and moisture.Brush your Goldendoodle's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it.

Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Goldendoodle to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Goldendoodle makes a wonderful family pet, especially if his nature takes after the Golden Retriever parent. He's likely to be highly patient and gentle and to get along well with children of all ages.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.He does well in homes with other dogs and pets and doesn't actively show aggression toward other animals. Of course, as with all dogs, it's important to properly socialize your Goldendoodle from puppyhood.","Goldendoodles are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Goldendoodles in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

As is always the case with newer mixed dog breeds, exact size standards might vary.Most weigh in at 50 to 75 pounds and range in height from 22 to 26 inches. Female Gollies might be slightly smaller than their male counterparts.","When the Gollie is relaxing, they're a very chill and affectionate dog. In fact, it's often joked that the breed is likely to view a stranger as new best friend rather than someone to be wary of.The mixed breed's loving nature is balanced by their highly energetic and athletic side, which comes to the forefront when they're outdoors. Due to the Gollie's intelligence, exercise sessions should also involve a mental stimulation element. The mixed breed loves to show off how quickly they can learn new tricks and commands and master new agility or obstacle trials.The dog does not enjoy being left alone for long periods of time. This is definitely not a mixed breed to consider if you live in an apartment and are gone for most of the day.You'll soon find that your Gollie wants to be considered a part of the family all of the time. Once you've incorporated your pup into your day to day routine, you'll benefit from a super loving and friendly companion.","Gollies are generally considered to be healthy dogs; although, the breed can be predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Golden Retriever and Collie face. As always, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Gollies suffer from include:CataractsEpilepsyElbow Dysplasia","The Gollie is a dog with high energy and exercise needs. Consider one hour the absolute bare minimum amount of exercise and outdoor time you need to provide every single day. Make sure to add obstacle courses, fetch games and agility tasks into the repertoire.Ideally, you'll also want to provide a safe fenced-in yard or area where your Gollie can wander around and explore the world to satiate their innate intelligence and curiosity.Gollie's have somewhat of a reputation for being smelly dogs, which likely comes from their active outdoor nature. Aim to give the dog a bath once a month to ward this off. Just like with any dog who spends a lot of time outside, check paw pads and nails for any signs of damage.Your Gollie's teeth should be brushed once a week, too, along with checking their ears for signs of inflammation or infection. Ask your vet for guidance if you are not confident about undertaking these tasks yourself.","An ideal Gollie diet should be formulated for a medium-sized dog with high energy.Gollies need to stick to a healthy diet as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Gollie's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Gollie's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","The most common coat colors for Gollies are black, brown, gold, and white. They can either be one shade all over, or a combination of two or three colors.The Gollie's coat is long and straight and can feel dense to the touch. This is a mixed breed that definitely sheds a lot. Daily brushings are going to be key to keeping the coat in healthy condition. This will also help ward off mats.In general, the Gollie is an adaptable dog when it comes to climate. But be careful to kit your dog out with a dapper canine coat if it's particularly cold outside, and always provide fresh water and shade during the hotter months.","Gollies and kids get along great together. The dog is playful and tolerant, which means even young children form close bonds with the dog. Just make sure that proper socialization takes place at an early age so both parties know their boundaries.

This can be a game of fetch in a field or backyard, a run, or a couple of long walks.Gordon Setters do well with children and may be protective of the children in their family. In general, they make wonderful, caring companions for children and their whole family. It is important to remember that dogs and small children should never be left unsupervised, regardless of breed.Being an intelligent, hardworking breed, the Gordon Setter can become destructive if his needs for exercise and mental stimulation are not met. Boredom and extra energy are not a great mix to have, and the best way to avoid any destructiveness is through proper exercise and training.Gordon Setters are not backyard dogs. They are much happier when they are with their families and should not live away from them. They enjoy personal attention and family activities.Gordon Setters are generally rambunctious when they are young but usually become gentle and calm as they get older.Strong temperaments are well known in the breed and many owners have the feeling that they are ""owned"" and not owner. Gordons are independent and determined, qualities that can translate to stubbornness to some.Gordon Setters make excellent watchdogs and are wary of strangers. They may seem aloof to some but are loving toward their own family.Barking is not uncommon in the breed, and Gordons will bark to express their likes, dislikes, and other emotions, including whether they think you should have taken them with you when you left.Gordon Setters can suffer from separation anxiety and may become destructive when they do.Gordon Setters shed, and their coat requires more than minimal grooming. If you do not have the time needed to properly groom them, this may not be the breed for you.Although many Gordon Setters get along well with other animals, some may be aggressive toward other dogs. Socialization is important for all dogs and should be started as possible.Gordon Setters are not recommended for apartment living. Although they are generally quiet indoors, they need a large fenced yard to exercise in. They love to run so a fenced yard is a must.Although Gordon Setters are known for their stubbornness, they can be sensitive and easily cowed with abuse and neglect. Never treat your dog harshly but instead give him firm, fair, consistent training without the use of anger or physical force. If Gordon Setters aren't trained they may become destructive, wilful, and dominant.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",The Gordon Setter male stands 24 to 27 inches and weighs 55 to 80 pounds; females are 23 to 26 inches and 45 to 70 pounds.,"The loyal Gordon Setter is intensely devoted to his family but wary of strangers, characteristics that make him an excellent watchdog. He's mannerly and eager to please, but like any dog he'll take advantage of lax leadership and can become dominant, wilfull, and stubborn if not provided with firm, fair, consistent training. A Gordon Setter expert once wrote of the breed that if he acts sorry for a misdeed, he's probably more sorry that he got caught than that he misbehaved. In the field or in any competitive situation, he's alert, fearless, intelligent, and capable. He's a personal hunting dog, in the sense that he works nearby rather than ranging far afield. Gordons aren't fast, but they have a lot of stamina.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Gordon Setters need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Gordon Setter puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.It's not unusual for a Gordon puppy to go through a fear period sometime between 6 and 9 months of age. Without coddling him, maintain a calm demeanor so you can reassure him that whatever situation has spooked him is normal and nothing to be afraid of.","Gordons are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain diseases and conditions. Not all Gordons will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're buying or living with a Gordon.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, weight management, or medication to control the pain.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, and the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Gastric Dilatation Volvulus (Bloat): Also called bloat or torsion, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.","Gordon Setters need daily strenuous exercise, so they're good companions for joggers or runners. A good game of fetch in the backyard or a long walk will also contribute to their physical well being. Puppies are rambunctious and full of the devil. Let them play all they want in the backyard, but limit forced exercise such as road running or obedience jumps to avoid placing unnecessary strain on the still developing bones and joints. Avoid these types of workouts until the dog is 2 years old and introduce them gradually.Gordon Setters are intelligent dogs who are easy to train, although they require firmness and consistency to prevent them from taking advantage of you. You must be able to provide leadership without using anger or physical force.Housetraining is fairly easy with most Gordon Setters, although there are exceptions to every rule. Be consistent, keep the puppy on a schedule, and use a crate. Crate training not only aids in housetraining, it also keeps the puppy from chewing (a common habit of Gordon puppies) and provides a safe and quiet place for the dog to rest. The most important thing to remember is that housetraining is a long process. Your Gordon puppy may understand where he needs to do his business, but he may not have the bladder control to see it through until he's 4 months or older. If you will be gone for long periods of time for work or other activities, it's important to have someone who will let the puppy out for a pee break.The silver lining to the Gordon's wild puppyhood is his quiet and sedate adulthood. He loves competition, however, and can excel in many dog sports. The Gordon can be a busy breed, but once you understand his drive and meet his needs, he can be a wonderful companion who's just as happy to lie beside you as he is hiking or hunting beside you.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Gordon in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Gordon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Gordon Setter's attractive coat is soft and shiny, ranging from straight to slightly wavy. He has long hair on the ears, chest, belly, the back of the legs, and the tail. The tail is short, with feathering that grows in a triangular shape, becoming uniformly shorter toward the end of the tail.He wears a classic black and tan coat, with the tan markings being a rich chestnut or mahogany on the sides and bottom of the muzzle, over the eyes, on the throat, two large spots on the chest, on the inside of the hind legs (although not so much that the black is eliminated), on the forelegs, and around the vent (the anal opening). The black and tan colors are clearly defined, never mixed together. A Gordon may have a white spot on the chest, the smaller the better.Brush and comb your Gordon two or three times weekly to prevent mats and tangles. Trim the hair on the bottom of his feet and between the toes to prevent it from picking up debris in the summer and forming ice balls in winter.Brushing will go a long way toward keep your Gordon's coat clean and shiny, but you can bathe him every one or two weeks if you want without drying out the coat. Just be sure to use a shampoo and conditioner formulated for dogs and rinse thoroughly.All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Gordon's ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Gordon may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Gordon's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Gordon enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Gordon to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Gordons are fond of and protective toward children. They'll put up witha lot, and when they've had enough teasing or roughhousing, they'll walkaway. They may be a bit much for toddlers, though, being large enough toaccidentally knock them down.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and alwayssupervise any interactions between dogs and young children to preventany biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teachyour child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or totry to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, shouldever be left unsupervised with a child.Gordons get along with other dogs and cats if they're raised with them,but they might not be so friendly toward strange dogs.","Gordons are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Even though they make great housedogs, they need a lot of room just to move around. There's little that they can't reach (kitchen counters and dinner tables are no problem), and their tails can easily sweep your coffee table clean.Everything costs more when you have a big dog — collars, veterinary care, heartworm preventive, food. In addition, you'll need both a crate and a vehicle that are large enough to hold your Great Dane without crumpling him into a pretzel. And let's face it, you'll scoop up a lot of poop.It takes a while for the bones and joints of large dogs such as Great Danes to stop growing and become stable. Don't allow your Great Dane puppy to jump, and don't take him jogging until he's at least 18 months old; this will reduce stress on the growing bones and joints.The Dane's special giant-breed dietary requirements have to be followed, or else orthopedic issues can develop.Great Danes aren't particularly suited to apartments or small houses, simply because they're so big. They're not jumpers, fortunately, so a six-foot fence will contain them.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Male Great Danes are 30 to 34 inches tall and weigh 120 to 200 pounds. Females are 28 to 32 inches tall and weigh 100 to 130 pounds.,"A well-bred Dane is one of the best-natured dogs around. He's a gentle, sweet, affectionate pet who loves to play and is relaxed with children. He has a great desire to please, which makes him easy to train.The Great Dane wants to be where the family is. He likes people a lot, including strangers and children, and will welcome visitors happily, unless he thinks you need defending. Then he can be fiercely protective.Some Danes wish they were (or truly believe they are) lapdogs, and they'll keep trying to get there even if you and your lap mysteriously keep moving.Good-natured as they are, Great Danes definitely need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Great Dane puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Great Danes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Danes will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.Development Issues: Growing problems can develop in puppies and young adults. These are sometimes associated with an improper diet — often a diet too high in protein, calcium, or supplements.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Great Danes. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. It occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.Bone Cancer: Sometimes known as osteosarcoma, this is the most common bone tumor found in dogs. It's usually seen in middle-aged or elderly dogs, but larger breeds such as the Great Dane tend to develop tumors at younger ages. Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign is lameness, but the dog will need X-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs.Heart Disease: Heart diseases affect Great Danes; varieties include dilated cardiomyopathy, mitral valve defects, tricuspid valve dysplasia, subaortic stenosis, patent ductus arteriosus, and persistent right aortic arch. Prognosis and treatment vary depending on the specific disorder and the dog's age and general health.Surgery: Surgical issues are a bit different for Great Danes than for smaller dogs. For any needed surgery, find a surgeon who is experienced with giant-breed dogs. Ask for a presurgical blood test and ask them to include a clotting profile (this is not part of typical presurgical blood work).In Great Danes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","Despite his giant size, a Great Dane is mellow enough to be a good housedog, though he's not well suited to a tiny apartment because he'll knock into everything.He can get cold in the winter, so he shouldn't be left outside in colder climates — but then no dog should. In fact, he would enjoy having a sweater or fleece coat to keep him toasty warm when you go for a walk in a winter climate.He's relatively quiet indoors, but he needs a long walk at least once a day, or a large yard to play in. An adult Great Dane needs 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise, depending on his age and activity level. Puppies and adolescents need about 90 minutes of exercise a day.If you plan on keeping him in a yard occasionally, he'll need a six-foot fence, though he's not a jumper. If you're a gardening fan understand that he really enjoys destroying the landscaping (just a little safety tip in hopes of preventing human heart attacks).While you may want a running partner, wait to take your Great Dane jogging until he's at least 18 months old. Before then his bones are still growing, and they're just not up to the task. In fact, he may not be ready to go jogging until he's two.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Great Dane doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate (a really big one) is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Dane accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Dane in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Great Danes are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Diet is important for a rapidly growing giant-breed puppy like a Great Dane, more so than for most breeds. A Great Dane puppy should never eat regular puppy food because it's too rich for him; he needs the puppy food designed for large breeds. It's best not to supplement with anything, especially not with calcium.Assuming a high-quality food, the amount to give your Great Dane varies greatly with age and gender. However, generalized daily amounts are:Three to six months: females, 3 to 6 cups; males, 4 to 8 cupsEight months to one year: females, 5 to 8 cups; males, 6 to 10 cupsAdolescents: females, 8 cups; males, 9 to 15 cupsAdults: females, 6 to 8 cups; males 8 to 10 cupsUntil the age of four to five months, a Great Dane puppy should have three meals per day. After that, give him two meals per day for life. He should never have only one meal per day.For more on feeding your Great Dane, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The six usual colors of Great Danes' smooth, short coats are:Fawn (a golden color with a black mask)Brindle (fawn and black intermixed all over the body in a tiger-stripe pattern)Blue (steel blue, which is really a sort of gray)BlackHarlequin (white with irregular black patches over the entire body)Mantle (black and white with a solid black blanket over the body)He sheds a lot, but his coat is easy to keep in top condition with regular brushing. Use a firm bristle brush and shampoo as needed. Regular brushing keeps your Great Dane's coat healthy and clean, and cuts down on the number of baths he needs.As you might imagine, bathing a Great Dane is a daunting task, particularly if he's not looking forward to it. Hard to imagine him hiding under the kitchen table while trying to escape a bath, but it happens.Brush your Dane's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin getting your Dane used to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","A Great Dane loves children and is gentle with them, especially when raised with them from puppyhood. Keep in mind he doesn't have any idea how big he is compared to a small child, and so can accidentally knock them over quite easily.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child not to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away.Generally speaking, a Great Dane will get along with other pets in the household, but occasionally some can be aggressive with livestock, or they just may not care for the other pets. It's an individual taste: some won't tolerate another animal in the house, while others will snooze with the cats and other dogs.","Great Danes are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Danes in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a great Dane rescue.Great Dane Club of America RescueGreat Dane Rescue, Inc.Great Dane Rescue of OhioGreat Dane Rescue of North TexasRocky Mountain Great Dane RescueGreat Dane Rescue of South Carolina","Great Dane Club of America, Inc."

But homes with large yards are better.If you want a dog you can walk off leash, this may not be the dog for you because of his independent thinking and wandering tendencies.Expect some shedding on a constant basis and at least one major shedding period per year. On the up side, the Great Pyr only requires about 30 minutes of brushing a week.A Pyr can be difficult to train because of his ability to think on his own. He's not a good match for new or timid dog owners, because he needs consistency and a strong owner who will socialize him and train with positive reinforcement.He's a wonderful watchdog for the family, but he needs socialization to keep from becoming shy or aggressive to both dogs and people.He thrives with his family and should live inside the house. He can become bored and destructive when separated from his family or left to live out in the backyard.A Great Pyrenees is generally loving and gentle with younger creatures, so he's a wonderful dog for families with children.He's a hard-core barker and is not recommended for homes where his barking can disturb others.Great Pyrenees do best in cooler climates, but don't clip his hair during hot weather. His coat insulates him and keeps him cool, so when you shave the hair you compromise his natural protection from the sun.He needs exercise, but not as much as you'd think — 20 to 30 minutes a day is fine.He has a double dewclaw that should not be removed but should be kept trimmed.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.","The Great Pyrenees is a giant dog (both in size and heart). The average height is between 27 to 32 inches for a male and 25 to 29 inches for a female. On average, Great Pyrenees should be between 100 to 160 pounds for a male and 85 to 115 pounds for a female.","A calm, gentle, docile demeanor is the norm for a Great Pyr. Shyness, aggressiveness, and nervousness are not acceptable whatsoever, but do your part by providing tons of socialization when he's a puppy. With training, he's well mannered.He is gentle and can be somewhat serious. Courageous and devoted to his people, he's the best friend anyone could ask for; he's also a warm blanket and a comforting soul in the night. He loves being a therapy dog.He is intelligent, used to working on his own and figuring out things by himself, which means he's an independent thinker and can be stubborn. He manages to be a good guard dog while also being friendly, calm, and gentle.Like every dog, the Great Pyr needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Great Pyr puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Not all Great Pyrs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Bone Care: Large-breed bones require special consideration. Treat your Great Pyr like an antique until he's about 18 months old. His bones grow so fast that he can have growing pains, which is uncomfortable. He doesn't fill out until he's three or four years old.Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. It occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs but can occur in large dogs as well. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Addison's Disease: This is a serious disease also known as hypoadrenocorticism. It's caused when the adrenal gland does not produce enough adrenal hormones, which affects the salt and potassium levels in the body. Early signs of Addison's disease include lethargy, vomiting, and poor appetite. A severe sign can be heart arrhythmia. Treatment consists of fludrocortisone acetate or corticosteroids, and salting food. Aggressive treatments include intravenous medication.Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Entropion: Entropion, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Great Pyr has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically.Anesthesia Sensitivity: This can affect dogs with a low metabolism, like the Great Pyrenees. Remind your vet of that sensitivity prior to surgery.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Great Pyrs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","A good fence around your yard is absolutely necessary, and it should be at least four feet but preferably five or six feet high. This dog is used to roaming the Pyrenees Mountains while protecting his flocks, and he needs territory. If you don't have a fence to corral him, he'll keep running to grasp territory.He's a Houdini Hound who can scale fences. And if snow drifts to the height of the fence, he'll walk right over it, so get out that shovel and move the piles away if you don't want him visiting the neighbors during a snowstorm. (They could be surprised — it's a bit difficult to see him approaching in the snow.) There's a reason the Pyr rescue groups won't adopt a Pyr to anyone without a fence, or who thinks they can just yard-train him; it's simply not going to happen.He must have training from the time he's a small pup, but despite his size he needs gentle, positive reinforcement. He is scarily intuitive, has impeccable manners, and a memory like an elephant: he will never, ever forget anything, which is why you always need to use a kind, gentle approach in training. Negative training makes a Pyr shy, timid, and fearful, which is problematic in any dog, much less a dog of this size.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Pyr doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate (a big one) is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Pyr accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Pyr in a crate all day long, however. He shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Great Pyrenees are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.The Great Pyrenees need roughly 20 to 30 minutes of exercise per day to keep him in his best condition. That's not a lot for a dog this size. He adores cool or cold weather and loves to go for long hikes as long as it's not hot (or even warm). He's a big, hardy dog who can carry backpacks and gear, but don't let him do that in the summer because he needs to be kept cool.The Great Pyrenees is an intelligent breed and can become bored a bit too easily. Provide proper stimulation with toys to prevent any destructive behavior. He enjoys being with his family and can cause household ruin if left alone for long periods.Training a Great Pyrenees can be difficult, but it can also be easy if you start early and maintain kindness and consistency. Originally bred for guarding livestock, the Pyr is used to working and thinking on his own. This trait is still strong, whether he comes from a line of pet dogs or working dogs.He needs you to establish the rules as soon as he comes into your home. If you don't want a 100-pound dog on your couch, then the cute 20-pound fluff ball shouldn't be allowed on the couch either. Patience is the key to training him, but remember that even after basic training you'll never have a dog who can roam off-lead, since he will wander regardless of your cries and commands.Socialization is a must for a Great Pyr. He is bred to guard, and if he's not properly socialized he can become aggressive or fearful. Expose your puppy to a variety of situations, including puppy classes, after he's been properly vaccinated. Also keep him in the house with you're the family. A dog who is left tied up outside will become aggressive, even to his owners.Leash training is also important, especially considering that your Great Pyrenees will eventually use up to 160 pounds of weight to pull you where he wants to go. Don't let him off-leash as he will, without a doubt, roam. Leash-training will start in puppy kindergarten, and the techniques you learn there should be practiced regularly.After your Great Pyrenees has reached a level of training that you're happy with, you can take him to many different kinds of training events and competitions, especially those that are done on-leash.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 6 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Great Pyrenees in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Great Pyr, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Great Pyrenees are considered to be average to heavy shedders, depending on the climate they live in, so expect to have white hairs on your clothes, furniture, car, and toothbrush.Despite the shedding, he's fairly easy to groom and only requires about 30 minutes of work per week. If his silk-like hair gets dirty, it dries quickly and combs right out. Granted, he leaves white, silky dust bunnies on your floor, but if you collect it and put it outside, birds will use it for their nests — it's a good insulator for their newborn babies.The Great Pyrenees has a double coat, the top coat and the undercoat. The top coat is long and thick and should be coarse in texture. It may be straight or slightly wavy, but it shouldn't be curly. There should be a mane or ruff around the neck, more pronounced in males; and feathering on the back of the legs, forming a pantaloon on the back thighs. The tail should have a plume and the face and ears should have short, fine hair. The undercoat should be dense and woolly.He is white or white with markings that can be badger, tan, gray, or reddish-brown in color. The markings can appear on the head, as a mask, on the ears, on the tail, and (occasionally) on the body — but markings should never cover more than one-third of the body. The undercoat can be either shaded or white.Don't clip the Pyr's hair during hot weather. The coat keeps him cool, and when you shave the hair you compromise his natural protection from the sun.Other than brushing, the Great Pyrenees coat requires very little care. Generally the eyebrows, whiskers, ears, hocks, feet, and forelegs are trimmed, although that's usually for dogs showing in conformation. Baths can be infrequent (once every couple of months) since his coat tends to shed dirt. When you do bathe your Great Pyrenees, use a high-quality dog shampoo to avoid stripping oils from the dog's coat and skin.Check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.Because his floppy ears block air circulation, they must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Pyr may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Pyr's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails regularly if he doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your arms from getting scratched when your Great Pyrenees enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Pyr to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin or feet and in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","A Pyr loves children and is absolutely devoted to them. He'll protect them with his life, and he is in fact tender toward everything that is small and weak. Young children can't manage such a large dog on a leash, however, so he should be walked by an adult or an older child.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Great Pyr generally does well with other animals in the house, especially if he's been raised with them from puppyhood. A well-socialized Pyr tends to get along with other dogs.","Great Pyrenees are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

A home with a fenced yard is ideal.The Swissy was bred to work and likes to have a job to do. Obedience training can give him the mental stimulation he needs, and is essential for handling a dog of this size.Although he's generally good with kids, the Swissy is a large dog who can accidentally knock over a small child.The Swissy is prone to overheating. Keep him inside in air conditioning or in front of fans when the weather's hot, and wait until it cools off to exercise him.Some Swiss Mountain Dogs will chase small animals. To keep the neighbor's cat safe — as well as your dog — make sure the yard is securely fenced, and keep him on leash when you're out and about.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 25.5 to 28.5 inches tall and weigh 105 to 140 pounds. Females stand 23.5 to 27 inches tall and weigh 85 to 110 pounds.,"The Swissy's personality is gentle, alert, and fun loving. These aren't easygoing, pushover dogs, however; they're confident canines with their own ideas, and they can be stubborn at times. Because of their bold personality, Swissy dogs do best with owners who can be kind, yet confident, leaders.This breed is alert and observant, always on the lookout for something amiss. That, plus his loud bark to alert you when he spies something out of the ordinary, makes him a good watchdog, though he's typically not aggressive.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Swissy needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Swissy puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Swissy dogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Swissy dogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Swissy dogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal.

It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakened joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simply develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as the Swissy. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.Splenic Torsion: This condition occurs when the spleen rotates, causing it to expand and become engorged with blood. The symptoms are not always obvious, but can include vomiting, fever, pale gums, and tenderness. Splenic torsion requires immediate veterinarian care and the surgical removal of the spleen is necessary.Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Distichiasis: This is a condition in which extra eyelashes (cilia) grow from the glands of the upper or lower eyelid. A hair follicle develops deep within the glands rather than on the skin surface. As the hair grows, it follows the duct of the gland and exits from the gland opening along the smooth surface of the eyelid margin. In many cases, these eyelashes rub on the cornea, causing irritation and tearing, and occasionally corneal abrasions.Entropion: Entropion is an inward rolling of the eyelid. It usually affects the lower eyelid of both eyes, causing irritation and vision loss. It generally occurs before a dog turns a year old; surgery to correct the problem is usually held off until the dog reaches adulthood.Panosteitis: Commonly called Pano, this condition causes self-limiting lameness. At about five to 12 months of age, the dog may limp on one leg, then another, then it stops. There are usually no long-term effects. Rest and restricted activity may be necessary for a while if the dog's in pain.Swissy Lick: This mysterious affliction causes the dog to start franticly licking or swallowing anything in sight. The cause is unknown, although it appears to be related to severe gastrointestinal pain. It's treated with gas and acid-reducing medications. Swissy lick is more common among young dogs, but seniors can get it as well.","The Swissy is not suited to apartment or condo life. Because he's a large, working dog, he needs room to roam — a home with a large, securely fenced yard is ideal. You won't need to sign up for a marathon, though; he needs just a moderate amount of exercise.With his Swiss heritage, this breed is a natural fit for cold climates, and he loves to romp in the snow. The flips side is that he's prone to heatstroke. Don't let him exercise strenuously when it's hot; during hot spells, limit your outings to cool early mornings or evenings. During the heat of the day, keep him inside with fans or air conditioning. If he has to be outside, make sure he has shade and, of course, plenty of water.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Swissy puppy. Like many large breeds, the Swissy grows rapidly between the ages of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders and injury.Keep your Swissy pup on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps him from growing too fast. Don't let him run and play on hard surfaces such a pavement, do a lot of jumping, or pull weights until he is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes.Like all dogs, the Swissy needs to be socialized — taught to be friendly to other dogs and people — beginning in puppyhood. Puppy kindergarten and obedience classes are a great way to socialize your Swissy and teach him good canine manners.Now, as for housetraining: while every dog is different, Swissy fans say that the breed generally takes to housetraining slowly. The reason isn't exactly clear. But if you use crates and stick to a good housetraining routine, your Swissy will grasp the general concept of housetraining within a week or two of arriving at his new home. But don't count on him to be completely reliable in the house until many months later.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Large-breed puppies such as the Swissy need slow, sustained growth to help prevent orthopedic problems, such as hip dysplasia. Raise them on a diet designed for large-breed dogs or food for adult dogs. Whatever diet you choose shouldn't overemphasize protein, fat, and calorie levels: 22 to 24 percent protein and 12 to 15 percent fat is recommended.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.

The breed sheds minimally most of the time, with the exception of twice-yearly ""blow-outs,"" when the undercoat comes out. The color is distinct, with a black outer coat and rust and white markings on the face and body.Grooming a Swissy isn't terribly complicated — the short coat is easy to care for and the breed is naturally clean. Brushing once or twice a week, plus a bath as needed (usually every month or so) with a mild dog shampoo is enough to keep the Swissy looking sharp.Brush your Swissy's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Swissy to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

However, young children should never be left unsupervised with any dog. Even if the Swissy means well, this is a large, strong dog, and a Swissy can easily knock over a small child by accident.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The good-natured Swissy generally enjoys the company of other dogs and loves to play rough and rambunctious. This is especially true if he has been properly socialized with other dogs at an early age. As in any breed, dogs of the same sex who haven't been spayed or neutered may not tolerate each another.Swissy dogs vary in their prey drive: some will chase squirrels, cats, and other small animals, and some won't. As with any dog, you'll have a better shot at peace among the family pets if you expose your Swissy to other animals beginning at an early age, and are careful about the introductions.","The Swissy is often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Swissy dogs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Swissy rescue.Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America Rescue","Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Club of America, Inc."
Greyhound,3,4,2,5,1,1,5,5,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,5,4,5,4,4,5,5,4,5,2,5,5,3,5,4,Hound Dogs,"2 feet, 1 inch to 2 feet, 6 inches tall at the shoulder",50 to 85 pounds,12 to 15 years,"Although a Greyhound puppy is an adorable addition to your family, many sweet adult Greyhounds are available for adoption after their racing days are over. Every year, many ""retired"" racing Greyhounds are abandoned, euthanized, or sold to laboratories, but they can adapt wonderfully to home life and give you many years of companionship. Before you put your name on a waiting list for a Greyhound puppy, check out the world of Greyhound rescue.Because of their thin coats, Greyhounds can get the shivers. If you live in a cold climate, buy a warm coat for your dog to wear in snow or rain.A Greyhound should never be allowed to run off leash except in a securely fenced area. Greyhounds have a strong prey drive and will take off after a rabbit or squirrel before you even see it.When Greyhounds aren't socialized — exposed to many different people, places, and situations — they can become timid and have problems adapting to changes in schedule or environment. Take the time to socialize your dog or puppy.Greyhounds are generally a loving breed and affectionate to their people. Usually this friendliness extends to strangers, but they can be aloof with some or all strangers.Although many believe that this breed is made to run and has the destructive energy to go with it, that couldn't be further from the truth. Greyhounds are generally docile and quiet, and they're world-class nappers. They do well in apartments and homes with small yards because of their low indoor energy.Muzzling Greyhounds, especially retired racing Greyhounds, is a common practice. Greyhounds will nip at other dogs and can hurt smaller dogs and animals if their prey drive takes over. Many rescues recommend muzzling adopted Greyhounds, at least until they get settled into their new homes and you have a better idea of their temperament.Greyhounds are low to average shedders depending on the time of the year and the individual dog, and they require minimal grooming. The lack of a heavy coat leaves their skin vulnerable to scrapes, tears, and nicks.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The Greyhound is a sleek, athletic dog. There are two types, which vary somewhat in size: Racing Greyhounds are usually 25 to 29 inches tall, and show Greyhounds are slightly larger, at 26 to 30 inches in height. In both types, males typically weigh 65 to 85 pounds, females 50 to 65 pounds, with racing dogs tending toward the lower end of the scale.","Greyhounds generally have a wonderful temperament, being friendly and non-aggressive, although some can be aloof toward strangers. Give them a treat, though, and they're likely to become a friend for life.They're intelligent and independent, even catlike in many ways. They do have a sensitive side and are quick to react to tensions in the home. They can become shy or timid with mistreatment, even if it's unintentional.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Greyhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Greyhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Greyhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Greyhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Greyhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Greyhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs. A normal dose for any other dog of his size can kill a Greyhound, probably because of the breed's low percentage of body fat. Choose a veterinarian who's aware of this sensitivity and knows how to dose your Greyhound. If you can't find a vet who's knowledgeable about sighthounds, be sure to alert any vet who treats your dog to this sensitivity.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism involves low levels of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily thyroid medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog that's getting daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don't suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss.Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death in a dog if it is not treated promptly. Usually the twist must be repaired surgically.","Greyhounds are fairly low energy dogs, but they still need and enjoy a daily walk. If they aren't exercised regularly, they can become bored, which may lead to destructive behavior.Greyhound have an inborn drive to chase prey, and owners need a solid fence to keep their dogs from taking off after small animals. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended with this breed, as their desire to chase is far stronger than any fear of a temporary shock.Greyhounds should also be kept on leash during walks. That strong prey drive will have them ignoring commands if something interesting catches their eye. And with their speed, they can easily outdistance a distraught owner and become lost.Greyhounds can become overweight, which is bad for their health. It's common for a retired racing Greyhound to gain roughly 5 pounds after retirement, but he shouldn't be allowed to gain any more than that. Because he's tall, provide him with raised feeding dishes to make dining more comfortable.Training your Greyhound, whether adopted as an adult or bought as a puppy, should begin as soon as he's home. Greyhounds can have a stubborn streak and often approach training with a ""what do I get out of it?"" mentality. They're independent and need a confident, consistent owner.However, they also have a sensitive side, which makes harsh training the worst fit for the breed. They do better with patience, consistency, and training methods that use rewards rather than punishment — they like food rewards best.Greyhounds sometimes have difficulty with the sit command as it's not a natural position for them, and you will often see them sort of balancing on their tail.Greyhounds need to be exposed to many different people, places, and situations — a process that trainers call socialization — to prevent them from becoming timid or fearful. Many obedience schools offer socialization classes, which are also a wonderful start to obedience basics.Other ways to socialize your Greyhound include visits to dog-friendly public places and stores, walks in the neighborhood, and inviting people to your home. Introduce new social situations gradually.Greyhounds are generally easy to housetrain. Retired racing greyhounds are especially amenable to crate training and will do well as long as you keep them on a regular potty schedule.","Recommended daily amount: Males, 2.5 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals; females, 1.5 to 3 cups.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Greyhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Greyhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Greyhounds have a short, smooth coat that's easy to care for. Despite their name, they can be any color, including fawn, black, red, blue, gray, or white. They can also be various shades of brindle, a striped pattern that gives them the look of having just streaked across the African savanna, or white with at least one other color, known as particolor.Despite their short coat, Greyhounds shed. Brush them daily to keep shedding at a manageable level. Your Greyhound will love being massaged with a rubber curry brush, also known as a hound mitt. Use a dry dog shampoo when you bathe him to keep his coat clean and smelling great.Keep ears clean and free of debris with a moist cotton ball. Never insert anything into the ear canal; just clean around the outer ear.This breed's teeth need the most dedicated care. Greyhounds tend to have poor dental health, so regular brushing is a must if you want them to have sweet breath and no ugly tartar buildup.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Greyhound to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Greyhounds can be patient with children and have been known to step delicately around toddlers, but they do best in homes with older children who know how to act around dogs. They're more likely to walk away from a teasing child than to snap at him.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Although Greyhounds do very well with other dogs, they can view smaller dogs, cats, or other small pets as prey, especially if the animals run from them. Some have a much lower prey drive than others, but it's always best to supervise your Greyhound around smaller animals. Instinct can overcome training, and Greyhounds have been known to injure or even kill smaller pets.And even if they're best friends with your indoor cat, they may view outdoor cats that come onto their property as fair game.","Greyhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Crate training is recommended.Harriers tend to be vocal and some love to howl.Some Harriers like to dig and have been known to dig under fences to escape and chase after something.Harriers are hunting dogs and will take any opportunity to pursue game or follow a scent. A secure fence is a necessity if you have a Harrier. Underground electronic fences are not effective with Harriers because they have a high pain threshold and the brief shock they get from crossing the invisible line does not deter them from chasing or investigating things beyond its boundaries.Harriers are high-energy dogs and have a great deal of stamina. They are perfect for active families or athletic people who like to jog or bicycle with their dogs alongside (on leash so they don't take off on a chase), but they may become obese or destructive if living in a more sedentary home.If not properly trained and socialized, your Harrier may see cats and other small furry animals as prey and act accordingly.Harriers are good watchdogs who will bark if they feel that someone or something is threatening their territory, but they are not good guard dogs. After raising the alarm, they are likely to greet strangers as long-lost friends.Harriers can stay outdoors if given adequate shelter from the heat and cold, but being pack animals, they are at their best when they are around other dogs or their family.The Harrier's long ears prevent adequate air circulation to their ears and they may be prone to ear infections.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Harriers are medium-size dogs. They stand between 19 and 21 inches tall and weigh 45 to 60 pounds.,"As a typical pack hound — a dog that's used to working as part of a group — the gentle Harrier is outgoing and friendly, never aggressive toward other dogs.He's also a typical hound in that he's an independent thinker and can be stubborn. It's important to train him using methods that will persuade him that being obedient is his idea. Positive reinforcement — rewards for correct behavior — is the way to go with this breed. He's a good watchdog and will alert you to strange sounds or the approach of people. If you're not home, he'll watch the burglar come in and cart off your silver.Like every dog, Harriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Harrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Harriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Harriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Harriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","Harriers have a lot of energy and stamina. They are great companions if they get enough exercise, but if not, they may become destructive. Harriers are not recommended for apartment dwellers. They do best in homes that have large yards or acreage for them to run. Yards need fences that your Harrier can't dig under or jump over.Harriers can live outside with proper shelter from the heat and cold, but prefer to be indoors, close to their family, whom they consider their pack. Harriers bay — a prolonged bark — when they're bored or lonely, so it's not a good idea to leave them alone in the backyard for hours at a time, especially if you have neighbors nearby.These are dogs who love to be with you, but do not demand attention. They are capable of entertaining themselves. Your job is to make sure that their idea of entertainment doesn't mean getting into mischief! Give your adult Harrier a long walk with lots of time for sniffing or take him jogging every day.Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening.From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile.After he's a year old, your Harrier pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. Avoid hard surfaces such as concrete. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.

The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.More important than the amount of food your Harrier gets is his overall condition. He should look muscular, not fat. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye exam and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. He should have a visible waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can't feel the last two ribs, he needs less food and more exercise. If you can see his ribs, feed more.For more on feeding your Harrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Harriers have short, thick, shiny coats, and very soft ears. They can come in a wide variety of colors, but the most common colors seen in the U.S. are tri-colors (black, tan and white), and red and white. They resemble an English Foxhound, only smaller.The Harrier coat is easy to groom. Give him a weekly brushing with a rubber curry brush or hound mitt — a nubbly glove that fits over your hand. Harriers shed a moderate amount, but regular brushing will help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture.Check his long ears for foreign objects such as foxtails or burrs, especially if he's been running out in the fields. Because his floppy ears block air circulation, it's a good idea to clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian.Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Harrier may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Harrier's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Harrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin getting your Harrier accustomed to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

He can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone, and does best when someone is home during the day to keep him company.Although they generally outgrow this, it's quite common for Havanese puppies (among other breeds) to eat their own stools. Scoop your puppy's poop right away so he can't indulge in this icky habit.The long, silky coat of the Havanese is beautiful, but requires regular brushing and care. Many owners prefer to clip it short, but if you want to show your dog, you'll have to let it grow long and invest a good amount of time in grooming, or money in paying a groomer. Another reason to keep it long: If you live in a warm climate, the long coat helps keep your dog cool.The Havanese does well in all types of housing, from apartments to homes with large yards. But he'll probably bark when he sees someone passing by the house or when he hears a strange noise. The good news is that he doesn't bark just for the sake of hearing his own voice.The Havanese loves to watch the world from up high, and will find his way onto the backs of sofas and tables to watch the day pass by.Paper is a favorite toy for the Havanese, and this clever little breed will go out of his way to find it, even sniffing through the jackets of your guests. Toilet paper, which can give him hours of shredding pleasure, is a special treat. Toss him a roll, and your house will soon look like it's been hit by Halloween pranksters.The Havanese needs as much exercise as a larger dog. A long walk or an active game each day should do it.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.

This disease is found in many breeds of dogs. Although it's a genetic disease that breeders screen for, it can show up in a puppy born to parents free of the disease. Treatments include medication, weight loss if the dog is overweight, nutritional supplements, and sometimes surgery.Elbow Dysplasia: Elbow dysplasia is similar to hip dysplasia; it's a degenerative disease that affects the elbow joint. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, causing the joint to be malformed and weakened. The disease varies in severity; some dogs only develop a little stiffness, others become lame. The treatment is surgery, weight management, and medication.Chondrodysplasia: This is a genetic disorder that's commonly mislabeled as ""dwarfism."" Affected dogs have abnormally short limbs for the breed. This can range in severity from nearly normal to crippling. In less severe cases, dogs can live full and healthy lives, but any dog with this disorder should not be bred.Legg-Perthes Disease: Legg-perthes causes a deformity of the hip joint ball. It starts with a decrease in the blood supply to the head of the femur bone, until the bone eventually dies off, collapses, and becomes deformed. The result is arthritis or inflammation of the hip joint. It's unclear what causes legg-perthes, but it may be inherited or injury related. Treatment includes rest, physical therapy, and surgically removing the deformed femoral head and neck. Dogs generally do well after the surgery, and many suffer only minor lameness, particularly during weather changes.Cataracts: A cataract is opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes vision loss. The affected eye has a cloudy appearance. It is an inherited disease and usually occurs with old age, but can occur at any age. Cataracts are treated by surgical removal.Deafness: Deafness provides many challenges for both the dog and the owner. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but deafness usually cannot be cured. Patience and time must be given to a deaf dog and there are many products on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you both.Patellar Luxation: Also known as a ""trick knee,"" patellar luxation is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patellia, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness or an abnormal gait. Treatment for patellar luxation is usually surgery.Portosystemic Shunt: A portosystemic shunt is an abnormal blood flow where the blood from the digestive tract bypasses the liver and continues to the systemic venous circulation. When this occurs, toxins that are normally removed by the liver are circulated through the body leading to other diseases, such as hepatic encephalopath. Portosystemic shunts usually occur in conjunction with another disease and symptoms include poor balance, loss of appetite, lethargy, blindness, depression, weakness, seizures, disorientation, and coma. A change in diet and surgery can help treat the problem.Heart Murmur: A disturbance in the blood flow is the cause of heart murmurs. There are five grades of heart murmurs; they are graded on how audible the murmur is. Heart murmurs are an indicator of disease; treatment is necessary, which can include medication, special diet, and exercise restrictions.Mitral Valve Insufficiency: Mitral valve insufficiency is more commonly seen in older dogs when the mitral valve, which is found between the left atrium and ventricle, begins to fail. When this happens, the mitral valve fails to prevent the flow of blood into the left atrium. This can cause heart failure. Symptoms include hypertension, fluid in the lungs, and a decrease in strength of the heart muscle. Treatment includes medication, change of diet, and exercise restrictions.","Although the Havanese is a small breed, he has a fair amount of energy to burn. A lengthy walk or an active game of fetch each day will keep him happy.The Havanese does well in a variety of homes, from apartments to large homes with yards — as long as he's an indoor dog. This breed isn't suited for life in the backyard. He is happiest when he is with his family. Although they're not overly yappy, they do bark at passersby, so if your home has noise restrictions, this may not be the breed for you.His eagerness to please his owners makes the Havanese fairly easy to train in most cases. Basic obedience, beginning with puppy classes, is recommended. Housetraining, however, can be particularly challenging for a Havanese, so you'll need to be especially patient during this process. You'll get there, but crate training is a must.Separation anxiety can be a serious concern for the Havanese and his owner. The best way to deal with this problem is to avoid it altogether. Don't leave the dog alone for long periods of time and, when you do leave, put him in a crate with plenty of sturdy toys to keep him occupied.Though he's small and fuzzy, a Havanese isn't a toy. Like all breeds, he needs to learn good canine manners. Don't spoil him with table scraps or by carrying him all the time he'll get fat or become overly possessive of you.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Havanese in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Havanese, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Havanese coat is thick but silky, soft, and light, and it doesn't shed easily. The coat is long and ranges from straight to curly, although wavy is considered the ideal for the show ring. It comes in white, black, black and tan, sable, gray, and a myriad of other colors and markings.Many owners clip the Havanese coat short to make it easier to care for. But if you show your Havanese — or just want to look like you do — you'll have to keep it long, and should expect to do a lot of grooming.When kept long, the coat needs daily brushing to prevent mats from forming, and frequent baths to keep it clean. In general, it's wise to keep the hair above the eyes tied up to prevent irritation — it looks cute, too.Unless you're highly motivated and skilled, you're probably better off with a professional groomer. Owners can learn to groom their dogs, but it takes a dedicated person to keep this breed's coat in good shape.Watery eyes and resulting tearstains are common in the Havanese. Keep in mind that excessive tearing can signal an eye problem and should be checked by a veterinarian. However, most tearstains are not serious, and the cause is simply unknown. You can improve the stained look by keeping the hair around the eyes clean (wipe daily with a damp cloth). There are whitening products on the market made specifically for lightening the stains, which some owners find helpful.Brush your Havanese's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Havanese enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Havanese to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Havanese is an excellent family dog who's affectionate with everyone, including kids of all ages and other dogs and pets. But because he's so small, he could easily get hurt by accident, so it's especially important to teach kids how to treat the dog.You should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.","Havanese are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Havanese in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.The Hokkaido breed has a thick coat, as they are of the Spitz type, and it should be brushed out once or twice a week to remove dead fur and prevent matting. The frequency of brushing should be increased during their shedding period. Make sure to invest in a good quality wire comb to reach the under coat.They also do not enjoy taking baths, and--what's worse--it takes a long time for their coat to dry due to its density. Baths are recommended generally a few times a year to prevent issues.Also make sure to introduce your Hokkaido dog early to grooming tasks like nail clipping and ear checks to increase their tolerance for it. Make sure to maintain their oral hygiene regularly to prevent any serious dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Hokkaido diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with medium energy. Like most dogs, the Hokkaido will gain weight if allowed to overeat beyond their diet, so make sure to stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit the number of treats throughout the day, as well.As with all dogs, the Hokkaido's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Hokkaido's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","The main colors of the Hokkaido breed are black, red, black & tan, white, brindle, and sesame.The Hokkaido dog breed has a double coat with a soft undercoat and a thick, straight overcoat. Their coats are not considered hypoallergenic. It is fairly difficult to brush them as they are double coated and need to be brushed almost every day. They are also not fond of bathing; thus, it might be better to bathe them a few times a year.As Hokkaido dog breeds are double coated, they are able to withstand colder weather. In summer, they might shed more, which will lead you to brush them more often.","The Hokkaido can be great with children of all ages and sizes, though it is best when they are raised with them or are socialized properly at a young age. These beautiful pups are medium-sized in build but are very strong and can handle the play of people of all sizes. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with any dog, the Hokkaido can be a great playmate and guard dog for them.When it comes to other pets, it is best they are not around smaller animals such as cats, hamsters, and guinea pigs. These dogs are natural born hunters, and it is simply in their blood. As far as other dogs, it is best to make sure you socialize your Hokkaido at a very early age so they get used to playing with others. Because of their nature, they have a crouch and prowl style which some might mistake for aggression. It is simply how they play.The key for Hokkaido dogs to get along with children and other dogs is to make sure you socialize them when they are young and train them well.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Hokkaidos because they are a rare breed outside of Japan.

Beezers have a strong prey drive and will pursue moving objects heedless of your commands.Ibizan Hounds are excellent jumpers. It takes at least a 6-foot fence to confine them to a yard. Underground electronic fences are not recommended for this breed.Beezers need daily exercise. If their exercise requirements are not met, they can become bored and destructive.Male Ibizan Hounds may develop poor appetites when they are adolescents. Encourage them to eat, but don't go overboard with food bribes, elaborate meals, or hand feeding; you'll simply end up with a picky eater.Beezers become cold easily. If you live in a cold or wet climate, purchase a coat for your dog.Ibizan Hounds are excellent with children, but all dogs should be supervised when they are with young children.These dogs are generally quiet indoors and can become couch potatoes but they need a daily walk or run.Ibizan Hounds are expert counter surfers so don't leave food out, even if you think it's out of your dog's reach.Ibizan Hounds are generally not aggressive but they do have a high prey drive and are not best suited for homes with small animals. They can learn to get along with cats if they're raised with them, but outdoor cats and other animals are fair game.Ibizan Hounds are a rare breed. Expect to spend time on a waiting list if you're interested in one of these dogs.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",A male Ibizan Hound stands 23.5 to 27.5 inches and weighs 50 pounds; a female is 22.5 to 26 inches and 45 pounds.,"The lively Ibizan is attracted by anything that moves and will run after cats, rabbits, or anything else that looks like it might be fun to chase. His large, mobile ears are indicative of his super sense of hearing, which makes him an excellent watchdog. He might not bark an alarm, but if you see those ears twitching, you'll know something or someone is around. With his family, the Ibizan is even-tempered, affectionate, and loyal. He may be reserved at first with strangers, but he should never be shy or aggressive.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Ibizan Hounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Ibizan puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Ibizan Hounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Beezers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Beezers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Seizures: Seizures can have a number of causes. They can be hereditary; they can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or they can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Ibizan Hound has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Axonal Dystrophy: Axonal Dystrophy is a rare neurological disorder that is seen occasionally in Ibizan Hounds. It affects young puppies.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Deafness: Deafness can affect one or both ears. Puppies and adults can be tested to verify that their hearing is sound. If your Ibizan has hearing loss, he'll require special training techniques, as well as extra patience. Aids such as vibrating collars can help.Retinal Dysplasia: This is a developmental malformation of the retina that the dog is born with. Veterinary ophthalmologists can determine if puppies are affected when they are 7 to 12 weeks old. Cases can range from mild to severe. Retinal dysplasia shouldn't affect a dog's ability to function as a companion, but affected dogs shouldn't be bred.","With their quiet nature and moderate exercise needs, Ibizans are suited to most living situations, from condos to homes with yards, as long you can provide them with a couple of daily walks or runs. They aren't trustworthy off leash, however, and should never be allowed to run free except in a safely fenced area. An Ibizan is an excellent jumper and should be confined by a fence that's at least six feet high. Don't count on an underground electronic fence to keep him in your yard; the desire to chase a moving object will always overcome the threat of a momentary shock.An Ibizan is an excellent walking or jogging companion and will enjoy a couple of 20- or 30-minute outings daily. He'll appreciate any opportunity to run free, although he may take advantage of it for only a few minutes.Be careful not to exercise puppies too much until they reach maturity. The general rule is 5 minutes for every month of age; i.e. a 5-month-old puppy should receive no more than 25 minutes of exercise per day. Train your Beezer with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Hounds in general weren't created to work closely with people, so they need short, fun training sessions that will hold their interest. Ibizan Hounds are intelligent and can learn quickly, but they'll become bored if training is repetitive. If you train your Ibizan correctly, he'll be an eager, enthusiastic student, but if your teaching methods are harsh or boring, this sensitive dog will refuse to respond to you.Ibizans aren't difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended, however, as an aid to housetraining and to prevent your Ibizan puppy or adolescent from getting into mischief when you're not around to supervise. Remember that he has a slender body with little fat for padding and provide a cushion for his crate. Otherwise, your Ibizan may find his quarters uncomfortable.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Ibizan Hound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time.

Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Beezer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Ibizan Hound can have a coat that's shorthaired or wirehaired. The wirehaired coat can be one to three inches long, with the longest hair on the back, the back of the thighs, and the tail. He may sport a moustache on his muzzle. Whether he has a short or wire coat, the Beezer's hair is hard to the touch.Ibizans can be white, red (ranging from a light yellow-red called lion to a deep red), or red and white. Don't be taken aback by his pigmentation. His nose and eye rims are supposed to be flesh-colored, not black.It's easy to groom an Ibizan, no matter which type of coat he has. Brush him weekly to remove loose hair and keep his coat shiny and skin healthy. You can brush him more often if you want to reduce the amount of hair he sheds. Bathe only as needed.Brush your Beezer's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Ibizan enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Ibizan to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Because they're so playful and silly, Ibizans are good with children. They can be gentle but may chase young children who are running around. They're probably best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Ibizans enjoy the company of other dogs and can learn to get along with cats, if they're introduced at an early age.

They become very unhappy when they are left alone for more than a few hours and this unhappiness usually results in destructive behavior. Irish Setters do not make good outdoor dogs and need to stay inside, close to their family.The high-energy, athletic Irish Setter needs room to run and the best place for him to do that is in a large, fenced yard.Irish Setters need lots of exercise and should be exercised twice a day for at least half an hour each time.Irish Setters need obedience training to channel their mischievous and sometimes stubborn nature.Irish Setters do very well with other animals and children. It is important, however, to properly socialize your puppy regardless of the breed's temperament or your living situation. You might not have children or other pets now, but that could change. Lack of socialization can cause many difficulties.Irish Setters need to be groomed daily or every other day to keep their long, silky coats from becoming tangled. They are moderate shedders, so you will have some hair in your house, especially during shedding seasons.Irish Setters do not mature quickly. Some dogs settle down by the age of 2, but others remain puppylike their entire lives.Irish Setters are inquisitive by nature and will get into anything they can find or reach. This trait can also make training more difficult because they generally have a hard time staying focused. If you can keep them interested in training, they learn quickly.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",The typical male Irish Setter stands 27 inches at the shoulder and weighs 70 pounds; females are 25 inches and weigh 60 pounds.,"The Irish Setter is fun-loving, playful, and affectionate, always ready for a rollicking good time. He can be mischievous and isn't above raiding your underwear drawer and prancing into the living room bearing a leopard-print thong in his teeth — while guests are there, natch.Irish Setters are outgoing and love people. They aren't really guard dogs, although they've been known to step in and protect their people as needed. They are, however, excellent watchdogs and will bark to let you know of visitors or intruders. Irish Setters are slow to mature and will retain their puppy enthusiasm for several years and often throughout their life.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Irish Setters need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Irish Setter puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Irish Setters are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Setters will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Irish Setters, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, and the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Canine Leukocyte (CAD): Canine Leukocyte is an inherited abnormality that affects the white blood cells ability to fight infection. This disease impairs the immune system and is found in Irish Setters. Dogs who have this disease will suffer from immunological complications and reoccurring infections. Breeders are currently trying to remove Canine Leukocyte from their breeding lines and there is a DNA test that can be done to show that a dog is free of the gene. It is important to ask your potential breeder if their dogs have been screened for CLAD.Epilepsy: The Irish Setter can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Irish Setter has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. A new DNA test for PRA will help to reduce the incidence of this disease in the breed.Hypertrophic Osteodystrophy (HOD): Hypertrophic osteodystrophy, which causes lameness and is linked to excessive levels of protein and calcium in the diet, may affect puppies between 4 and 8 months of age. Besides lameness, signs include fever, appetite loss, swollen joints, lethargy, and reluctance to walk. It can occasionally be fatal. HOD can be difficult to diagnose, so make sure your veterinarian is aware that the condition can affect Irish Setters. It's treated with a course of steroids, antibiotics, and pain relievers.Gastric Torsion (Bloat): This is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Panosteitis: Panosteitis is a disease that affects the bones, especially the limb bones, of primarily young large breed dogs. A lameness in one or more leg is the result of inflammation in the bone. The disease usually lasts from 1 to 6 months and the dog will go through periods of pain and periods of good health. There is no treatment but it is managed with anti-inflammatories and pain relievers.","The best home for an Irish Setter is one with a large fenced yard or acreage. This breed needs room to run. He is a hunting dog, so he must be contained by a fence or restrained by a leash to prevent him from wandering off. He should live indoors with his family, never alone in a kennel or backyard.Irish Setters need at least an hour of exercise daily. This can be done in a variety of different ways, but one of the best ways is to allow the Irish Setter to run. He's a great jogging companion and will also enjoy running alongside a bicycle. Long walks, playing fetch, swimming, and of course hunting are other excellent ways to exercise your Irish Setter.Irish Setter puppies have different exercise needs. From 8 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he's a year old, your Irish Setter pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile, run on soft surfaces such as grass or dirt, and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.Irish Setters are intelligent dogs who are easy to train, although they require firmness and consistency to prevent them from taking advantage of you. You must be able to provide leadership without using anger or physical force. Training an Irish Setter is primarily a matter of preventing boredom on his part. He tends to suffer from attention deficit disorder. Help him focus by keeping him entertained. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and avoid repetitive exercises. Switch rewards and activities frequently to retain his interest. He accepts fair corrections good-naturedly.Crate training is a must for your Irish Setter puppy. This breed is curious and will examine anything and everything with his mouth. A crate will help keep your puppy and your belongings safe when you aren't around to supervise.Most Irish Setters are easy to housetrain. Be consistent, keep the puppy on a schedule, and use a crate. The most important thing to remember is that housetraining is a long process. Your Irish Setter puppy may understand where he needs to do his business, but he may not have the bladder control to see it through until he's 4 months or older. If you will be gone for long periods of time for work or other activities, it's important to have someone who will let the puppy out for a pee break.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Irish Setter in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Irish Setter, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog. ","His beautiful coat is one of the characteristics that give the Irish Setter his reputation as one of the most beautiful breeds in the dog world. Short and fine on the head and forelegs, the burnished mahogany or rich chestnut red coat is moderately long and straight on the rest of the body, with long, silky feathering on the ears, the backs of the forelegs and thighs, and the tail, and a fringe of hair on the belly and chest. In the show ring, Irish Setters are trimmed to emphasize the lean head and clean neck and to show the natural outline of the foot.Brush your Irish Setter at least every other day to keep his coat shiny and tangle-free. Check for burrs and other debris any time he's been out in the field or on a hike. Unless he rolls in something stinky, he shouldn't need a bath more than a couple of times a year, as long as you keep him well brushed. You can bathe him more frequently if you want, however, and you'll need to if you plan to show him. Use a shampoo made for dogs to avoid drying out his coat and skin.All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Irish Setter's ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Irish Setter may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Irish Setter's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Irish Setter enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Irish Setter to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early. ","Irish Setters are good friends for active older children, but they can be too rambunctious for toddlers. It's all too easy for an Irish Setter to accidentally knock a child down.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Irish Setters are also good with other dogs in the household, as well as cats, especially if they're raised with them, but they might see pet birds as prey since those are what they are bred to hunt.","Irish Setters are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Irish Setters in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

The height at the shoulder is 18 to 20 inches.","The Irish Terrier was created to be a companion, guard dog, and hunter. As such, he's good-tempered, spirited, alert, and adaptable. He's also plucky, reckless, curious, and devoted. Those things all sound wonderful, and they are, but those characteristics aren't always easy to live with. This is an independent, smart, strong-willed dog who's scrappy with other dogs. He needs mental challenges in the form of training and play, physical exercise, and loving but firm discipline. On the plus side, Irish Terriers love people and are often friendly toward strangers. They're not a one-person dog.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","Some Irish Terriers are inveterate escape artists, so fence height should be higher than one might think is needed for a dog this size. A good height is five to six feet. Like all terriers, ITs are diggers, so the bottom of your fence should be escape-proof as well. You may need to set it in concrete or line the bottom of it with chicken wire. An underground electronic fence will not keep an Irish Terrier confined. More important, it won't prevent other dogs from coming onto your property and getting into a fight with your IT.The energetic Irish Terrier needs moderate exercise. Give him two or three walks on leash of 20 to 30 minutes each day. A chance to romp in a safely fenced area is also welcome. He's not a true running breed, but he's a good companion for joggers who go at an easy to moderate pace. He's not a distance runner or a fast-paced dog. Condition him gradually, and wait until he's fully grown before you start jogging with him.If you can control his tendency to bark, an Irish Terrier will do as well in an apartment as in a house. He should live indoors with his people, and given sufficient exercise, he's a quiet, polite housemate. If you leave him alone in the backyard with no companionship or occupation, he's likely to relandscape it with a number of holes.Puppy or adult, the Irish Terrier is playful, but his idea of play and yours may vary. He'll enjoy shredding magazines or other papers, overturning the garbage or the laundry basket, surfing the kitchen counter or dining room table for something to eat (he'll find a way up there) and, of course, barking at every passing car, dog, bicyclist — you get the idea. Dogproof your home, teach him what's acceptable behavior and what's not, and crate him when you can't be there to supervise, especially during his curious puppyhood. A crate protects him from getting into trouble for being destructive, and it protects your belongings from destruction.When it comes to training, the Irish Terrier has a ""What's in it for me?"" attitude. You've got to give him an incentive to do what you want, and if you don't keep training fun and interesting, he'll just ignore you. Training an Irish Terrier requires creativity, firmness, and positive reinforcement in the form of praise, play, and food rewards. He's sensitive and won't respond well to harsh treatment. Keep training sessions short, change them around a lot, and always end them when he's done something well and you can praise him for it.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The hairs grow so closely together that even if you part them with your fingers, it's hard to see the skin. It's short enough that you can still see the outline of the body. At the base of the stiff outer coat is some finer and softer hair, lighter in color, which is the undercoat. The double coat protects the Irish Terrier from rough underbrush and cold or wet weather when he's working or playing outdoors.His coat is bright red, golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). He may have a small patch of white on the chest. Puppies sometimes have black hair at birth, which should disappear before they are grown.Brush the coat weekly with a natural bristle brush to keep it clean and healthy. You must strip it by hand a couple of times a year if you want to keep the hard texture and bright color, a must if you plan to show your Irish Terrier. For companion dogs, it's often easier to clip the coat, but be aware that it will become softer to the touch and lighter in color. You may or may not care about that. If you plan to strip it, ask the breeder to show you how. It's the kind of thing you can do while you and your IT are watching a 30-minute television show. If you don't mind the scruffy look, you can just leave the coat as is, with no stripping or clipping.Irish Terriers shed little and are sometimes referred to as nonallergenic or hypoallergenic. There is no truly nonallergenic breed. Every dog produces some allergens through skin dander (not hair), saliva, and urine. That said, some people with allergies do find that they can tolerate this breed. Individual dogs, even within the same breed, vary in the amount of allergens they produce, so the best thing you can do is to meet as many Irish Terriers as possible and see how you react around them.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Irish Terrier's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don't get caught in the carpet and tear, and don't scratch your legs when your Irish Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.It's not exactly a grooming issue, but your Irish Terrier puppy's ears may need to be ""trained"" to achieve those perfectly folded V-shaped ears that contribute to the Irish Terrier's roguish demeanor. This involves gluing and taping the ears to the head until they fall right, usually at 4 to 8 months of age. If it's necessary, your dog's breeder can show you how.","It's said that the little people (leprechauns) gave Irish Terriers to children to be their playmates. Their size and energy level make them great companions for active kids, but as always, they should both be supervised, especially if children are very young. Teach your puppy not to be rough or mouthy, and teach your child not to pull the dog's tail or ears or hit him. Children should never approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Irish Terriers don't like strange dogs, and they can be aggressive toward other dogs of the same sex. Early socialization with lots of other dogs, strong leadership on your part, and neutering can go a long way toward reducing an Irish Terrier's dog aggression, but they're not a guarantee that you'll turn him into a dog who's buddy-buddy with other canines.If you have one Irish Terrier, he can probably learn to get along with one or more cats. Early socialization is key. More than one Irish Terrier may gang up on a cat or cats.

Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Follicular Dysplasia: A group of syndromes that have hair loss and changes in coat quality in common. Hair loss in Irish Water Spaniels may first be noticed at 2 to 4 years of age over the back, and spreads slowly to most of the trunk. The coat change is progressive and permanent but has little effect on the dog's health.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of the hormone produced from the thyroid gland, which is found in the neck. The mild symptoms of the disease may be infertility. The more apparent signs of this disease are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low levels of energy and irregular heat cycles. The fur on the dog becomes course and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. It can be treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires a lifetime treatment. A dog that is having daily treatment can live a full and happy life.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your IWS has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if necessary when the dog reaches maturity.Paronychia: This condition is not well understood. It occurs in the dog's toenails, and you will often see dogs with it chewing on their feet. The problem can occur in dogs who have had their nails trimmed regularly. The toenail's inner core becomes mushy and may become infected with bacteria and fungus, causing a foul odor. Even without an infection present the disease will progress. The outer shell of the nail eventually falls off, exposing the quick. One or more toes may be affected. Treatment is necessary to avoid suffering. Some owners eliminate allergens in the diet and reported satisfactory results; other owners had the toes amputated.Distichiasis: This minor condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog's eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your dog squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia.Megaesophagus: Megaesophagus is believed to be both a congenital disease and adult-onset disease in which the esophagus loses tone and dilates. This hinders the ability of the esophagus to transport food and can prevent breathing during swallowing. Dogs with megaesophagus often regurgitate food that has not reached the stomach. This is not a powerful active vomiting but more of a passive regurgitation where the food falls out of the dog's mouth. It's caused by nerve damage to the esophagus and in the case of young puppies the damage may improve as the dog grows. In adults, megaesophagus is usually preceded by another disease that causes nerve damage. The disease can be treated with medication and diet, but it's difficult to manage and doesn't always have good results.Epilepsy: This disorder causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your IWS has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.Vaccination Sensitivity: There are reports of Irish Water Spaniels suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, signs include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. A dog that is sensitive to vaccines can develop complications or die, though this is rare. Watch your IWS carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual.Drug Sensitivity: Some breeds, including Irish Water Spaniels, show sensitivity to certain medications, including some antiparasitic and antibiotic drugs. Signs of this sensitivity range from tremors, depression, seizures, incoordination, hypersalivation, coma, and even death. Ask your veterinarian to become familiar with the drugs that can negatively affect the Irish Water Spaniel.","A hunting breed with a great deal of energy and stamina, the Irish Water Spaniel needs a yard to romp in and isn't suited to apartment life. Give him at least an hour a day of running, long walks or hikes, or vigorous play such as retrieving a ball in the yard. If you have a pool or access to a lake, swimming is a great way for him to get exercise. Keep an eye on him just as you would a child, and be sure he knows how to get out of the pool safely. You can break up his activity into two or three 20- or 30-minute sessions throughout the day. As with any dog, don't run him ragged in the heat of the day.Puppies have different exercise needs. From 9 weeks to 4 months of age, puppy kindergarten once or twice a week is a great way for them to get exercise, training, and socialization, plus 15 to 20 minutes of playtime in the yard, morning and evening. Throw a ball for them to fetch. From 4 to 6 months of age, weekly obedience classes and daily half-mile walks will meet their needs, plus playtime in the yard. From 6 months to a year of age, play fetch with a ball or Frisbee for up to 40 minutes during cool mornings or evenings, not in the heat of the day. Continue to limit walks to a half mile. After he's a year old, your IWS pup can begin to jog with you, but keep the distance to less than a mile and give him frequent breaks along the way. As he continues to mature, you can increase the distance and time you run. These graduated levels of exercise will protect his developing bones and joints.Irish Water Spaniels work well with people, but they can be independent, with a mind of their own. Train them with kind but firm consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The IWS who's treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. An Irish Water Spaniel will make his own entertainment if you don't.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.If you're unsure whether your Irish Water Spaniel is overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Irish Water Spaniel, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Irish Water Spaniel has a double coat — a top coat and an under coat — with tight, crisp ringlets that cover the back, back, sides, and rear. Beneath the ribs the hair is longer, and curls and waves of hair cover the legs. Hair on the throat is short and smooth, forming a v-shaped patch. The curly body forms a sharp contrast with the smooth coat on the face, throat, toes, and tail. Speaking of the tail, it's a striking characteristic of the breed. Wide at the root, where the tail meets the body, it tapers to a fine point. It's covered with short, smooth hair and is known as a rat tail.The Irish Water Spaniel is always a solid liver color, described as deep reddish brown. You won't see any white markings on him except for those due to graying from age.Irish Water Spaniels shed little to no hair, but they must be brushed two or three times a week to keep the coat from tangling or matting, as well as to keep it clean and healthy. The oil in the coat attracts debris and dirt. Regular brushing not only distributes the oil throughout the coat to keep the skin healthy but also removes the dirt and debris. The breed can be prone to ear infections due to the pendant earflap. In other words, those floppy ears hold in moisture, and the wet, warm environment is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Clean and dry the ears every time your IWS goes swimming.To do this, gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your IWS may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Irish Water Spaniel's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog's feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your IWS enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your IWS to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Irish Water Spaniels do best with children if they are raised with them. Early socialization — exposure to a variety of peoples, places, sights, sounds, and situations — also helps. Always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Irish Water Spaniels can get along well with other pets in the family if introduced to them at a young age. Otherwise, supervise them carefully. They are hunting dogs and may view smaller animals, especially birds, as prey. Protect pet birds even if you're sure your IWS understands they're off limits. Some spaniels can learn that, if they're taught from puppyhood, but don't assume that it will happen with every dog. You may always need to keep the two separated, if only so your IWS doesn't pull your parakeet's tail or your parrot won't take a bite out of your Irish Water Spaniel's sensitive nose.","Irish Water Spaniels are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Irish Water Spaniels in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Irish Water Spaniel rescue.Irish Water Spaniel Club of America",not available

Although they have relatively low activity levels inside, they need room to stretch out and aren't built for negotiating stairs.Irish Wolfhounds require at least 40 minutes of daily exercise and do best in a home with a large fenced yard.Irish Wolfhounds need a fenced yard to keep them from chasing prey away from their yards. They should not be kept in a yard with underground electronic fencing. The desire to chase is too strong to be overcome by the threat of a momentary shock.The Irish Wolfhound is a gentle dog who usually gets along well with everyone. With early socialization and training, he'll be gracious toward other dogs and forbearing of indoor cats. He'll view outdoor cats and other animals as fair game.If you are looking for a long-lived breed, the Irish Wolfhound is not for you. He lives roughly 6 to 8 years and his giant size predisposes him to many health problems.Irish Wolfhounds do not make good guard dogs although their size can be a deterrent to a would-be intruder.The Irish Wolfhound is an average shedder and only needs to be brushed on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. You'll need to strip the longer portions of his coat if you want to keep him looking like the Irish Wolfhounds that compete in the conformation ring.Irish Wolfhounds should be walked on leash to prevent them from chasing animals or other moving objects, such as radio-controlled cars.The Irish Wolfhound is not a pony and should not be ridden by children, no matter how small. His joints aren't built for the strain. Nor is he built for pulling a cart or other vehicle.Irish Wolfhounds thrive when they are with their owners. They are not outdoor dogs, although they enjoy playing outside.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",A male Irish Wolfhound stands at least 32 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs at least 120 pounds. The Irish Wolfhound female is at least 30 inches tall and 105 pounds. Many are larger. Males usually average 34 to 35 inches and 140 to 180 pounds; females 32 to 34 inches and 115 to 140 pounds.,"Intelligent and gentle, the Irish Wolfhound has a strong desire for human companionship. With his family, he's calm, dignified, and responsive. He's sensitive and must be trained using positive reinforcement such as praise and food rewards. Harsh words or physical punishment will cause him to shut down.When it comes to watchdog duties, he's alert but not suspicious. There's not an aggressive bone in his body, so he's a poor choice as a guard dog.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Irish Wolfhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Irish Wolfhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Irish Wolfhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Irish Wolfhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Irish Wolfhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Irish Wolfhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs that can lead to the death of the dog if it is administered a regular dose. This sensitivity is probably related to the lower percentage of body fat in this breed than other breeds. A regular dose for a dog the size of the Irish Wolfhound is generally too much for the low-body-fat Irish Wolfhound. Choose a veterinarian who is familiar with this sensitivity in sighthounds.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or weight management or anti-inflammatory medication to control the pain.Liver Shunt: A liver shunt is an abnormal blood flow between the liver and the body. That's a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet.Heart Disease: Irish Wolfhounds can be prone to heart disease, primarily heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time.Fibrocartilaginous Embolic Myelopathy: This condition occurs when pieces of cartilaginous material obstruct blood vessels supplying the spinal cord, causing partial or complete paralysis of the hind legs. The condition usually affects dogs between the ages of 3 and 6 years and may occur suddenly during any activity. There is no treatment, but some dogs improve with time. The severity of the loss of use must be determined before a course of action can be decided. Some dogs can live out their lives with only minimal assistance, but others are fully paralyzed. If physical rehabilitation doesn't help, euthanasia is the kindest option.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don't suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.","Despite his great size, the Irish Wolfhound is a housedog. He loves being with people and is calm indoors. He's best suited to a home without stairs; going down them can damage his joints.Give him access to a securely fenced yard where he can run, and he'll be happy. A fence is necessary to prevent this breed from chasing other animals. An underground electronic fence won't do the job; the instinct to chase is much stronger than the fear of a momentary shock.Irish Wolfhound adults need a couple of 20-minute play times where they can run freely every day. They'll enjoy a walk as well. Avoid any exercise an hour before meals and two hours after meals to decrease the risk of gastric torsion, or bloat.Puppies need free play in a securely fenced yard, but limit running to only a few minutes a day. They shouldn't be taken on walks until they're at least six months old. Start with short walks of no more than five minutes, and build up to walks of a mile over a three-month period. They shouldn't reach a distance of two miles until they're a year old.Continue this gradual and gentle exercise program until the Irish Wolfhound reaches maturity at 18 to 24 months of age. Giant breeds are prone to joint problems, and excessive exercise during their growth and development phase can damage their joints.Walks on leash are a must with this breed. They are sighthounds and will chase running animals when they see them, heedless of your calls to come. A sighthound on the chase will focus on his prey, not traffic, and can easily become injured or killed. He can also injure or kill the animal he's pursuing, which won't do much for your relationship with your neighbors if their Toy Poodle or Siamese cat is his victim.Irish Wolfhounds are intelligent and trainable if you're consistent and use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise. They're generally easy to housetrain, and a crate can help, although it shouldn't be overused.Crate training is a great aid to housetraining, and it will also keep your belongings safe from your puppy and your puppy safe from your wrath because he chewed up your favorite shoes. The Irish Wolfhound should not be crated for long periods, however. Long hours in a crate can damage his joints.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 8 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The hair on the eyes and under the jaw is wiry and long. A pet-quality Irish Wolfhound may have a softer or longer coat, but that doesn't affect his ability to be a companion. Coat colors are gray, brindle, red, black, white, or fawn.Irish Wolfhounds shed consistently throughout the year. Brush your dog weekly to keep the coat healthy. He shouldn't need a bath more than once or twice a year unless he gets into something stinky.To give the coat a neat look for the show ring or simply because you prefer it, gently pluck excess hair from the ears with your thumb and forefinger and use thinning scissors or a stripping knife to neaten the hair on the feet and tidy the hair on the side of the neck. Don't remove too much; the Irish Wolfhound should have something of a mane.To finish, strip out long hair under the belly and at the base of the tail. You want your Irish Wolfhound to have a smooth, clean look that shows off his graceful lines.Brush your dog's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Irish Wolfhound to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

Make sure your veterinarian is aware of these sensitivities, and avoid using organophosphate products to treat your home and yard for fleas.Italian Greyhound puppies are fearless and believe they can fly. Broken bones are common in pups between four and 12 months old, particularly the radius and ulna (the bones in the front legs).Although they're clever, Italian Greyhounds have a short attention span and a ""what's in it for me?"" attitude toward training. Keep training sessions short and positive, using play, treats, and praise to motivate your Italian Greyhound to learn.This breed can be extremely difficult to housetrain. Even if you follow a housetraining program religiously, your Italian Greyhound may never be totally trustworthy in the house. It helps to have a dog door, so your dog can come and go as he wishes. And if your dog gives you the signs that he needs to go outside, take him out that instant — they're not good at holding it.Italian Greyhounds need lots of love and attention, and if they don't get it, they'll become shy or hyper.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.

Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Von Willebrand's Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in both humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand's disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications.Vitreous Degeneration: The vitreous is a clear jelly that is the single largest structure of the eye. A healthy vitreous is essential for normal vision. If the vitreous becomes cloudy, liquefies, or moves from its position, vision may become impaired or lost. The condition is believed to be inherited, but the exact method of inheritance is unknown.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Generally a disease of small breeds, this condition — a deformity of the ball of the hip joint — can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn't fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.Epilepsy: The Italian Greyhound can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with proper management of this hereditary disorder.Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not removed. The treatment that is suggested is to neuter your dog. When the neutering takes place, a small incision is made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner.Portosystemic Shunt (PSS): This is an abnormal flow of blood between the liver and the body. That's a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet.","Italian Greyhounds (also known as IGs) have short coats and get the shivers easily, so they're not an outdoor breed. They need to be inside the house with their family, especially in bad weather. To keep your IG comfortable on chilly outdoor walks, give him a sweater or jacket. During warm weather, protect his thin skin with sunscreen made for dogs. Many Italian Greyhounds develop skin cancer, possibly because they love lying in the sun, so don't let your dog bake for hours.These little dogs have lots of energy, especially as puppies and young adults, but in their golden years they'll often adapt to the activity level of their owners. A daily walk will help your Italian Greyhound get his ya-yas out, but make sure to keep him on a leash. Even though he's small, he has the same instinct to chase as a larger sighthound and will take off after a squirrel, rabbit, or anything else that runs by. A leash is your only hope of hanging onto him.His hunting drive also means you'll need a secure fence in your yard. Italian Greyhounds are fabulous jumpers, so don't assume that a little four-foot wall is enough to keep him in. And don't use an underground electronic fence; the momentary shock won't deter your Italian Greyhound if he sees something he wants to chase.IGs are intelligent and easy to train if you have the right attitude. Like other hounds they usually approach training with a ""What's in it for me?"" philosophy. Motivational training methods — those that use food, praise, and play to reward the dog for getting it right, rather than punishing him for getting it wrong — is the best way to persuade them that they want to do what you ask. And since they have the short attention spans common to sighthounds, it's best to keep training sessions short and sweet.Like many small dogs, there's one aspect of training they don't pick up as easily: housetraining. Even with patience and consistency, you may never be completely successful. The number one reason people give up their Italian Greyhound to rescue groups or animal shelters is because they couldn't housetrain them.Harsh punishment will backfire, often making the dog fearful or even snappy. Your best bet is to get a dog door, so he can go in and out at will. Italian Greyhounds can also learn to use a litter box, although this doesn't always work well if you have more than one IG as you might end up cleaning it quite often.Prevent accidents by taking your IG outside the moment he gives you any signs that he needs to go — no waiting ""just a minute."" You can teach an Italian Greyhound that outdoors is the place to go potty, but if means going out in rain or snow, or if he doesn't have immediate access to the yard, he'd just as soon go indoors.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 3/4 cup of high-quality, high-calorie dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your IG in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your IG, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","An Italian Greyhound's short coat looks glossy like satin and feels soft to the touch. You'll find it in all shades of fawn, cream, red, blue, or black, either solid or with white markings.One of the benefits of living with an Italian Greyhound is that his coat doesn't shed much and is easy to care for. All you really need to do is brush it when it gets dusty, and bathe the dog when he's rolled in anything smelly — a favorite activity.Brush your IG's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your IG to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Italian Greyhounds can do well with children, but because they're small and delicate, it's especially important to teach kids that the dog is living animal, not a toy, who must be treated with love and respect. Many breeders will not sell a puppy to a household with children younger than ten years old.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Italian Greyhounds usually get along well with other pets, although you may need to keep an eye on them when they're cavorting about with bigger dogs, who could accidentally hurt them while playing.","Italian Greyhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many IGs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an IG rescue.Italian Greyhound Club of America RescueLifeline Italian Greyhound RescueMidwest Italian Greyhound RescueIndiana Italian Greyhound RescueTriangle Italian Greyhound RescueMissouri Italian Greyhound RescueRocket Angel Italian Greyhound Rescue","Italian Greyhound Club of America, Inc."

They are not purebreds like their Jack Russell Terrier or Chihuahua parents.Jack Chis love human companionship and are even great friends for children who know how to properly interact with small dogs.Jack Chis are prone to skin allergies and itching. Talk to your vet about allergy treatments if this is the case for your dog.The Jack Chi's coat can come in black, choclate, fawn, golden, cream, and white. They're often a mix of two colors or, in a few cases, three colors.Their coats are dense and straight, though Jack Chis may need extra protection with a doggy jacket in cold weather.The Jack Chi can adapt to apartment living very well, though they still require physical and mental stimulation. Interactive toys will help prevent boredom.","The Jack Chi is usually considered a small dog, although sometimes the breed can spill over into the medium category. As a newer dog breed, exact size standards might vary, but with Jack Russell Terrier and Chihuahua heritage, you can generally expect a smaller canine.Most weigh in at eight to 18 pounds and range in height from twelve to 15 inches.","When you first meet a Jack Chi, you'll instantly be struck by just how fun and friendly this breed is. They love human companionship, whether with adults or children, and their natural energy reserves mean that they're sprightly, active, and always up for a play session.These are smart dogs too. In fact, you'll need to make sure that your Jack Chi knows that you're the boss of the house. To that end, the Jack Chi's spunky and outgoing nature means that it's exceptionally important that you train and socialize your dog properly and from the earliest possible age. Exercise and mental stimulation are key to keeping the Jack Chi happy and content.Despite sometimes having a reputation as a little know-it-all and being hard to train, if you socialize your Jack Chi correctly, you'll have an excellent companion, a loving and affectionate sidekick, and a cute-as-a-button canine to show off to your friends.","Jack Chis are generally considered to be healthy dogs. However, this mixed breed can be susceptible to skin allergies that can result in excessive itching. As ever, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Jack Chis suffer from include:Patellar LuxationTracheal CollapseHeart ProblemsHypoglycemia","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Jack Chi's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can also help you develop a regular care routine that will keep your dog healthy.This very energetic breed requires regular exercise to lessen the risk of obesity and also to channel their energy into positive play times, as opposed to possibly destructive behavior around the home. A couple of long walks every day are essential. Also, the breed's heritage means that they love to engage their hunting instincts, so hide and seek toys and activities are vital to keep them mentally satisfied.This breed requires regular ear cleanings so that dirt and debris don't accumulate. Checking their nails every couple of months should also be added to the routine. As both the Jack Russell Terrier and Chihuahua are prone to eye issues, it's important to schedule eye examinations. Dental check ups are also needed to pick up on any signs of periodontal disease early.","An ideal Jack Chi diet should be formulated for a small-sized breed with medium energy. It is important to make sure your Jack Chi doesn't overeat as, just like other small dogs, their bodies do not handle excess weight well.As with all dogs, the Jack Chi's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Jack Chi's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Black, choclate, fawn, golden, cream, and white are all popular Jack Chi coat colors, and the breed often comes in a mix of two colors. In a few cases, triple-colored Jack Chis have even been spotted!Jack Chis have dense, medium coats, and they have a straight texture. As a pretty low maintenance dog, the Jack Chi's coat can be brushed once a week. This will help keep their coat smooth. Occasional baths will suffice with this breed.Due to the Chihuahua side of the Jack Chi's parentage, the breed isn't particularly fond of cold weather. So feel free to pick up a snappy doggy jacket during the winter months.","In general, Jack Chis and children are a great mix. The dogs are playful and smart and will happily enjoy joint play times with any little ones in your household. Just be sure to impress upon your child the correct way to handle and act around the dog, as they can become a little aggressive if they feel threatened due to mishandling.Jack Chis usually do fine with other animals and pets. Although, if the Jack Russell Terrier traits are strong in your particular Jack Chi, their hunting instincts might lead them to view domestic cats as prey. Be cautious when introducing new pets to each other.Ultimately, early socialization really pays off when you're adopting a Jack Chi, so make sure to reward your dog for good behavior and make sure to stick to a proper training regime when you bring the breed home.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Jack Chis because they are a mixed breed.

It' easier to train a dog to dig in a specific area than it is to break him of a digging habit.Jack Russell Terriers must have a securely fenced yard to give them room to play and burn off their abundant energy. Underground electronic fencing won't hold them. Jacks have been known to climb trees and even chain link fencing to escape their yards, so it's best if their time outdoors is supervised.First-time or timid dog owners would do well to choose another kind of dog. The Jack can be a challenge even for an experienced dog owner. He's strong willed and requires firm and consistent training.Jacks can be recreational barkers, so they're not suited to apartment life. Aggression toward other dogs can be a serious problem with the Jack Russell Terrier if he's not taught to get along with other canines from an early age.The Jack Russell thrives when he's with his family and should not live outdoors or in a kennel. When you leave the house, try turning on a radio to help prevent separation anxiety.Jacks are bouncy and will jump up on people and things. They're capable of jumping higher than 5 feet.Jack Russells have a strong prey drive and will take off after smaller animals. They should never be trusted off leash unless they're in a fenced area.Jack Russell Terriers have a high energy level and are active indoors and out. They need several walks per day, or several good games in the yard. They make excellent jogging companions.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and breeds for sound temperaments.","Jack Russells vary widely in size, because different types were used for different purposes and terrain. They range in height from 10 to 15 inches at the shoulder and weigh 13 to 17 pounds.Jack Russells who stand 10 to 12 inches and are longer than they are tall are known as Shorty Jacks. Shorty Jacks resemble Corgis or Dachshunds more than the taller, more balanced American Kennel Club-registered Parson Russell Terriers or the dogs registered by the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America or the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America.","The energetic and spirited Jack packs a lot of personality into his small body. Loving, devoted, and endlessly amusing, he enjoys life and all it has to offer. Given half a chance, he'll pursue his delights over fences and through the streets. He's incredibly intelligent, but his wilful nature can make him difficult to train. Friendly toward people, he can be aggressive toward other dogs and any animal that resembles prey, including cats. His fearless nature puts him at risk when he decides to take on a bigger dog.He thrives on structure and routine, but training sessions should be short and sweet to hold his interest. Repetition bores him. A proper Jack is friendly and affectionate, never shy.Like every dog, Jack Russells need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Jack Russell puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Jack Russell Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Jacks will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Jack Russells, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for patellas (knees) and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America doesn't register any dogs with hereditary defects; dogs must pass a specific veterinary exam before being registered.The following conditions may affect Jack Russell Terriers:Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease is generally a disease of small breeds. This condition — a deformity of the ball of the hip joint — can be confused with hip dysplasia. It causes wearing and arthritis. It can be repaired surgically, and the prognosis is good with the help of rehabilitation therapy afterward.Deafness is associated with white coat color and is sometimes seen in this breed.Patellar Luxation, also known as ""slipped stifles,"" is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Glaucoma is a painful disease in which pressure is abnormally high in the eye. Eyes are constantly producing and draining a fluid called aqueous humor. If the fluid doesn't drain correctly, the pressure inside the eye increases. That high pressure causes damage to the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss and blindness. There are two types. Primary glaucoma, which is hereditary, occurs when there is a problem in the area of the eye where fluid goes out. Secondary glaucoma is a result of some other problem in the eye, such as inflammation, a tumor, or injury. Glaucoma generally only affects one eye first. Affected eyes will be red, teary, squinty, and appear painful. A dilated pupil won't react to light, and the front of the eye will have a whitish, almost blue cloudiness. Vision loss and eventually blindness will result, sometimes even with treatment. Treatment can be surgery or it can be treated with medicine, depending on the case.Lens Luxation causes the lens of the eye to become displaced when the ligament holding it in place deteriorates. It's sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed.","The Jack Russell is a people lover who should live indoors with the family. It's best if he has access to a fenced yard where he can burn off some of his abundant energy. The fence should be impossible for him to climb, dig under, or jump — think Fort Knox. And don't count on an underground electronic fence to keep your Jack in the yard. The threat of a shock is nothing compared to the desire to chase what looks like prey.Always walk your Jack on leash to prevent him from chasing other animals, challenging bigger dogs, or running in front of cars. Give him 30 to 45 minutes of vigorous exercise daily, as well as plenty of off-leash play in the yard to keep him tired and out of trouble.Faint heart never trained feisty Jack Russell. People who live with Jack Russells must be firm and consistent in what they expect. Jacks are strong-willed dogs, and although they respond to positive motivation in the form of praise, play, and food rewards, they'll become stubborn in the face of harsh corrections. Provide your Jack Russell with rules and routines and apply the right amount of patience and motivation, however, and you'll be well rewarded. There are no limits to what a Jack Russell can learn when he's paired with the right person.Give your Jack plenty of positive interactions with other dogs beginning in puppyhood — early socialization is important to prevent aggression toward other dogs. ","Recommended daily amount: 1.25 to 1.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Both types have a double coat with a coarse texture. The broken coat is slightly longer with just a hint of eyebrows and a beard. Some Jacks have what's called a rough coat, which is longer than a broken coat. Whatever its type, the coat is never curly or wavy.Jacks can be white, white with black or tan markings, or tricolor (white, black, and tan). The white on the body helps the hunter see the dog in the field.Both coat types need only weekly brushing to remove dead and loose hair. If you brush your Jack faithfully, he should rarely need a bath. Broken or rough coats must be stripped once or twice a year.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Jack enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.The only other grooming care he needs is dental hygiene. Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease, daily for best results.Start brushing and examining your Jack when he's a puppy, to get him used to it.

The breed is commonly seen grooming itself by licking its paws and wiping its head. Also, they enjoy being up high and will perch on the back of couches and on tables.Considered to be an average shedder, the Japanese Chin requires a few minutes of brushing each day to remove loose hair and to keep the coat from tangling.Japanese Chin do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don't overexert themselves.Due to the breed's flat face, Japanese Chin will often snort, sniffle, or reverse sneeze. Generally, a Japanese Chin is still able to breathe through this, but if the attack becomes severe, you can try gently stroke his neck.Japanese Chin do well in apartments.Although Japanese Chin are intelligent and eager to please, they require interesting, fun-filled training sessions. Otherwise, they get bored and will turn their attention to something more entertaining.Japanese Chin do very well with older children but are not recommended for homes with smaller children due to their small size. They can be seriously injured with minimal force.Japanese Chin are companion dogs who thrive when they are with the people they love. They should not live outside or in a kennel away from their family.Japanese Chin require a lower amount of exercise compared to other breeds but they do enjoy a daily walk or play in the yard.Japanese Chin don't like being parted from their people, and separation anxiety is a common problem in the breed.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.

Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Chin, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Atrioventricular Endocardiosis: This degenerative disease affects the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart. It occurs when polysaccharide deposits distort the shape of the valves and cause them to leak. This can lead to heart failure. A change in diet and exercise may be necessary.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. A reputable breeder will have dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Heart Murmurs: Heart murmurs are caused by a disturbance in the blood flow through the chambers of the heart. They're an indicator that there may be a disease or condition of the heart that will need to be monitored and treated. Heart murmurs are graded on their loudness, with one being very soft and five being very loud. If disease is evident, as diagnosed through x-rays and an echocardiogram, the dog may require medication, a special diet, and a reduction in the amount of exercise he gets.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Japanese Chin has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn't attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur with old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract.","Japanese Chin require very little exercise. They are happy with a daily walk or a nice play session but they tend to require little else. Training can be slightly difficult since they have a mind of their own and become bored with repetitious training. When they like you, however, they'll work hard to please you. When they do wrong, a firm tone of voice is all you need to set them straight. Stronger corrections will only backfire and cause your Chin to stubbornly stand his ground.They can be difficult to housetrain but with patience and consistency, you can generally expect them to be housetrained by 4 months of age.Japanese Chin are companion dogs and should not live outdoors or in kennels. They become very attached to their people, and many suffer from separation anxiety. With their low exercise needs, Japanese Chin make wonderful apartment residents.The neck of the Japanese Chin is very delicate and it is strongly suggested that you use a harness instead of a collar when walking him.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.It is important when you are feeding your Japanese Chin that use choose a food that is high in fiber. Japanese Chin can suffer from impacted anal glands when their diet lacks good dietary fiber.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Chin, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Japanese Chin has an abundant coat that's silky to the touch. It's moderately long with a thick mane, feathered ears, a plumed tail, feathering on the back of the front legs, and light feathering that resembles culottes on the rear legs. The head, face, and forelegs are covered with short hair. Japanese Chin can have coats that are black and white, red and white, or black and white with tan points.Japanese Chin are a very clean breed and do not require regular baths. Once a month is plenty. Dry shampoos will generally keep them looking and smelling great. You can also use a mild shampoo, towel them until they're almost dry, brush the coat upward and outward with a pin brush, and voila! They're good to go. Chin do shed, but weekly brushing will help keep the hair from flying around your house. A quick daily brushing with a pin brush will help keep hair from tangling.Brush your Japanese Chin's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Japanese Chin to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Although the Japanese Chin is a gentle dog, he is not recommended for homes where there are young children. He can be easily hurt by an overexuberant child. The breed does well with older children who understand how to properly handle a dog.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Japanese Chin get along well with other dogs and cats, but they must be protected from larger dogs who could accidentally injure them in play. A cat's claws can injure their large eyes, so it's important to make sure everyone plays nicely together.","Chin are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Chin in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Chin rescue.Japanese Chin Care and Rescue EffortLuv-A-Chin Rescue",not available

Their fur repels most debris and dirt, and they rarely need baths, as they don't have a doggy odor. Two good brushings a week should do the trick.Despite being similar in appearance to the American Eskimo Dog, Pomeranian, and Samoyed breeds, the Japanese Spitz breed has its own history and is recognized as a separate breed by many kennel clubs around the world.Japanese Spitz dogs have a bark that is louder than what you might expect from their size, and they are known to be fearless, especially when protecting their families.Although they make good apartment dogs, Japanese Spitz dogs do not like to be left alone for long periods of time, or they may get anxious.These dogs are very smart and respond well to positive reinforcement training.Japanese Spitz dogs are family-friendly. They are known to be playful and gentle with children, and they tend to get along well with other dogs in the household.","Many kennel clubs disagree as to exactly what size Japanese Spitz dogs should be, but they range in between 10 and 16 inches in height at the shoulders. Females tend to be smaller than males on average. The usual weight of dogs in this breed is 11 to 20 pounds. Though there is disagreement about the proper size of the Japanese Spitz, they are usually larger than Pomeranians, which share many common characteristics.","Japanese Spitz dogs are prized for their wonderful temperaments. They are very family-friendly and have a playful spirit. These dogs love personal attention, and they won't respond well to being ignored or left alone for long periods of time. Their energy needs are fairly average. One good walk a day should suit a Japanese Spitz just fine, and they might also appreciate a chance to run off leash. Because they are good with other dogs, a trip to the dog park will let them run freely and burn off any excess energy. That said, every dog should have socialization training, regardless of breed, before interacting with other animals. Japanese Spitz dogs are known for their courage and protective nature. They will bark, surprisingly loudly, at strangers who enter their territory, though they will calm down if humans they trust reassure them. They should be introduced to visitors comfortably. Japanese Spitz dogs soak up training well, and they are quite intelligent. Loyal, active, obedient, and affectionate are all words that accurately describe Japanese Spitz dogs' personalities, which may contribute to their continued growth in popularity.","The Japanese Spitz dog breed is known to be fairly healthy with few of the genetic conditions that affect other purebreds. They may, however, be prone to luxating patellas--a condition where the kneecaps become dislocated. They may also have runny eyes from time to time, and their skin may become dry if they are bathed too frequently, which is why it is important to only bathe a Japanese Spitz when it is necessary. Owners should watch out for these conditions and maintain regular vet visits to catch and address any health concerns.","Japanese Spitz dogs tend to be low-maintenance and require fairly basic care. Their teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Their ears and paw pads should be checked for signs of infection, parasites, or debris and kept clean. Keep up with regular vet visits to maintain good health for your Japanese Spitz.",A Japanese Spitz dog diet should be formulated for a small-to-mid-sized breed with average energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your individual Japanese Spitz and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"Japanese Spitz dogs have pure, white coats. Even though they look like they have high grooming needs, they do not. Their coats have a texture that usually repels most dirt and debris. That said, their coats are thick, and they must be brushed to prevent knots and matting. Japanese Spitz dogs should be brushed at least twice a week with a brush that reaches to the undercoat. This will dislodge some of the dead hair and reduce the need to clean up after shedding, as well. Their coats tend to be dry compared to other breeds, which is why they should only be bathed as needed. Frequent bathing can remove some of the natural oil and moisture from the hair, which can cause itchiness. Overall, the grooming needs of the Japanese Spitz are quite low compared to many other breeds.","With a playful and gentle nature, Japanese Spitz dogs are great with kids. Their small size also means that they are unlikely to accidentally knock kids over or play too rough. A Japanese Spitz will make a loving, protective playmate for most children. That said, it is still important to supervise play and to instruct youngsters on how to properly handle and treat pets. Any dog can nip when they are afraid or uncomfortable. Japanese Spitz dogs also tend to do well with other pets in the house. They are not naturally aggressive. However, it is still important to keep up with socialization training with any dog to make sure that they remain comfortable in the presence of new pets and animals that they might interact with.","If you are interested in adopting a Japanese Spitz dog, you may have some trouble finding a rescue that specifically caters to this breed.

Renowned for their bravery and loyalty, this breed is accurately represented by a single heartwarming tale. In 1991, a Jindo named Baekgu was sold and transported over 187 miles. It returned to its original master over seven months later, haggard and near death. This story is so popular in Korea that it inspired cartoons, a documentary, and a storybook.With this story and others, the Jindo are revered in the Jindo province. In fact, anyone visiting the area is greeted with a dog statue of its namesake. Jindo were originally used as hunting dogs in their native country due to their prey instinct and strict loyalty. Despite this proclivity, the breed has also been assigned to the Non-Sporting Group by the AKC suggesting that they do not require frequent, significant exercise.However, Jindo do have medium-high energy levels and their high intelligence requires almost constant stimulation. If left alone for long periods of time, a Jindo will find a way to entertain itself (and not always in the most productive manner). Young Jindos have been known to destroy furniture, demolish small objects, and even climb walls and fences when left alone for too long.Luckily, the Jindo is quick and easy to train due to its high intelligence. This same intelligence serves as a double-edged sword when it comes to training: they are capable of learning even complicated commands swiftly, but their cleverness can lead them to be a bit hard-headed. These dogs require time and patience from even experienced owners.Nonetheless, the Jindo makes a great pet for active owners with the time to invest in this unique breed. They show diehard loyalty to their owners, making them great companions, and rather reserved with strangers, making them effective watchdogs as well. In fact, they are such good watchdogs that the Korean army frequently uses them as guard dogs for military bases.Due to the energy and agility of these dogs, they are best suited when they have access to the outdoors at least part time. But be warned: any fence must be at least 6-8” if you hope to contain a Jindo! Their strong hind legs make them great jumpers.The Jindo is known for its loyalty and are easy to train because of it. However, these dogs command respect. They can be hard-headed and stubborn to owners who have not earned their respect.Early exposure to other pets, strangers, kids, and cats is crucial to the social development of a Jindo. They are instinctually protective and may become aggressive towards strangers and other animals if not socialized properly.Jindos should not frequently be left alone at any age, although they are less likely to be destructive once they are trained. The Jindo are a social breed that will become lonely, bored, and even depressed if lacking contact with their owners.These dogs make great apartment-dwellers. They need frequent walks to burn of their high energy, but their natural neatness and desire to be close to people makes them good indoor dogs. (They even groom themselves, like cats!)Jindos even look like great watchdogs. They have bright, alert eyes and perked ears, making them appear on guard at all times. They are used by the South Korean military as guard dogs.No swimming! Jindos are known to be apprehensive and even downright fearful of water. These dogs do not make great water companions. Some owners have even reported their Jindos being afraid of rain. A Jindo will allow itself to be bathed by an owner it trusts, but almost begrudgingly.There is a legend that three Jindos once managed to take down a Siberian tiger. Needless to say, they make good hunting dogs. They have natural prey instincts and a strong pack mentality.It is hard to overstate the popularity of the Jindo dog in Korea. The breed has been dubbed Korea National Treasure #53 and has its own dedicated research institution, The Korean Jindo Dog Research Institute. As a National Treasure, they are protected under the Cultural Properties Protection Act.",not available,"The Jindo is notorious for being both loyal and intelligent. Their pack mentality lends itself to easy training and an eagerness to please. However, their intelligence leads them to demand respect before giving their unwavering loyalty to their owners. They can be stubborn in the early stages of training and require patience. Once respect has been earned, there are few breeds that surpass the loyalty of the Jindo. They are quick to train and can learn even the most complicated tricks and agility sequences with ease.One of the more challenging aspect of the Jindo is their need for socialization. Jindos are overall a gentle and loving breed, but they are wary of strangers. Their loyalty disposes them to be furiously protective which can present itself as aggression in poorly socialized dogs. Early socialization with other animals, children, and strangers will quickly ease this concern.","The Korean Jindo dog is generally a healthy breed with few serious genetic problems. There is only one known, infrequent health problem:Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a common disease in many breeds, including the Jindo. It presents itself initially with hair loss and a dull, thin coat. The dog’s skin will become flaky, though not necessary itchy. In later stages, hypothyroidism causes weight gain and sluggishness. It is not fatal and is actually inexpensive and simple to treat with a daily oral medication.","Jindos should be allowed indoors, close to their owners. They do not do well if relegated alone outside for long periods of time. They are loyal and intelligent and form deep bonds with humans based on mutual trust and respect. When left alone, they can get bored and lonely and may become destructive, especially at young ages.Due to their high intelligence, Jindos need patience during early training stages. They are quick to train once their stubbornness has been surpassed. Especially important to training is the need for early socialization. Jindos can show signs of aggression and suspicion towards strangers if not properly socialized at an early age.","Jindos have digestive tracks optimized for a carnivorous diet. As such, standard or cheap commercial dog food may not be the best choice for this breed. Foods high in corn are particularly bad for Jindos.A healthy and accessible option for Jindos include home-cooked meals with natural ingredients and special supplements. A good second choice is all-natural, high-quality, commercially produced foods.For more detailed information, or if you are unsure on what to buy, always check with your vet.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference, the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.","The Jindo is recognized by the UKC in six different colors: white, fawn, red, brindle, grey, black, and black and tan.The Jindo are naturally incredibly clean dogs. They have self-cleaning coats and do not need to be bathed frequently. They even groom themselves like cats. The downside of this is that they also shed profusely, especially in hot weather with their double coat.These dogs have no special grooming needs, making them fairly low maintenance in this department.","Jindos need to be socialized early if they will be exposed to children and other pets. While the Jindo are not known for being aggressive, they have been called an especially suspicious breed. They are fiercely protective of their owners, frequently to whatever ends they feel necessary. Coupled with a prey instinct, careful and patient training is a must for the social Jindo.At the same time, a properly socialized Jindo becomes very confident, gentle, and tolerant. While they are still independent and do not appreciate being challenged, with proper training they will not respond with aggression or violence.If you are unsure of how to properly train your Jindo, or want a helping hand, consider professional obedience training around six months of age.","Jindo Project, Inc",not available

It is also called Karjalankarhukoira in Finnish.The Karelian Bear Dog was bred to hunt even large, aggressive game such as bears, lynxes, wild boars, wolves, and moose.This breed is naturally aggressive to other animals, so it will take a good deal of socialization if it is to be kept as a household companion. These dogs may do best in a home with no other pets.In the United States, Karelian Bear dogs have been used at Yosemite and Glacier National Parks for bear control, as well as with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife.Modern Karelian Bear Dog coats are mostly black with white markings, and some have brown highlights on their black fur.Karelian Bear Dogs are still prized by big game hunters, but for those that want a household pet, they also make excellent watchdogs.The ancestry of the Karelian Bear Dog can be traced to neolithic times, according to archaeological findings, when dogs similar to the modern breed followed human settlers to regions of Scandinavia and Europe.","Male Karelian Bear Dogs are larger on average than females, standing at 21 to 24 inches in height at the shoulder, while females are usually around 19 to 22 inches in height. Dogs of this breed tend to weigh between 44 and 50 pounds, though individual Karelian Bear Dogs may be larger or smaller.","Karelian Bear Dogs are energetic, intelligent, and intense. They are prized for their natural hunting abilities, though this can make them aggressive toward other animals and dogs. Socialization and training need to begin early. Their hunting instincts may also cause Karelian Bear Dogs to wander or chase after animals. They do best with a large, fenced-in yard that will keep them secure and prevent them from getting lost while allowing them to run and burn off energy.As with many intelligent and energetic dogs, boredom is the enemy. A Karelian Bear Dog that isn't mentally and physically stimulated can act out in destructive ways. A tired dog is a happy dog, and that's especially true of this breed. Karelian Bear Dogs make excellent watchdogs, and even though they are not naturally trusting of strangers, they are highly loyal and protective of their human families. Their instinct is to bark and alert their humans to anything that may be a threat or anything that may simply be of interest. Karelian Bear Dogs require a dedicated, confident trainer who will rely on positive reinforcement. They are usually prized by hunters, but Karelian Bear Dogs can make loving family companions when their needs are addressed.","The Karelian Bear Dog breed is known to be fairly healthy with few of the genetic conditions that affect other purebreds. They may, however, be prone to hip dysplasia or eye problems. It is important for owners to watch out for these conditions and maintain regular vet visits to catch and address any health concerns.","Karelian Bear Dogs tend to have fast-growing nails that must be trimmed or ground down often to avoid cracking, splitting, and breaking. Their teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Their ears should be checked for signs of infection, parasites, or debris and kept clean. Keep up with regular vet visits to maintain good health for your Karelian Bear Dog.","A Karelian Bear Dog diet should be formulated for a mid-sized breed with above-average energy and exercise needs, though they often eat less than other dogs of their weight and energy level. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Karelian Bear Dog and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.","Although ancestors of Karelian Bear Dogs had coats of wolf gray, red, or black and tan, modern breed standards dictate that their coat should be mostly black with white markings. Their black fur may be slightly tinted with brown highlights. Karelian Bear Dogs have an outer coat of straight, stiff hairs, as well as an undercoat that is soft and thick. Their coat protects them in all weather, though it is particularly suited to keep them warm through the Scandinavian winter.Karelian Bear Dogs are average shedders, and they shed more heavily twice a year as their seasonal coat blows out. Weekly brushing should be enough to loosen dead hairs and keep the shedding under control. An occasional bath or bathing as needed should be sufficient, as most Karelian Bear Dogs do not have the usual ""doggy odor.""","Karelian Bear Dogs are fairly good with children, especially members of their own household. They are playful dogs, though they can be intense and play rough. Always keep an eye on children and dogs during playtime, even if a dog is well trained and not aggressive. Instruct kids on how to treat pets gently and appropriately. The Karelian Bear Dog is not overly trusting of strangers, so friends and young playmates that visit must be introduced, and the resident pooch must have time to relax and space to get used to the new person. The Karelian Bear Dog may not be the best breed for children who are very young and inexperienced with dogs, as they may be accidentally knocked over or injured by an overly enthusiastic pup during play.When it comes to other pets and dogs, the Karelian Bear Dog can be downright aggressive. Socialization training must begin early if they are to overcome their natural tendency to fight with other animals. Even then, the Karelian Bear Dog may be best suited to a home where they can be the sole pet.","Though there are many breeders of Karelian Bear Dogs that occasionally help rescue dogs from shelters and place them in forever homes, there are few, if any, groups specifically dedicated to only rescuing Karelian Bear Dogs.

His propensity to bark can be a problem if he's left alone too much and becomes bored.The best way to make a Keeshond miserable is to keep him separated from his family. He was bred to be a companion, and he needs to be part of family life. If you don't want a dog joining in family barbeques, card games, or movie time, consider a more independent breed.Keeping the Keeshond coat in good condition isn't terribly difficult, but the breed does shed like crazy once or twice or year. Luckily, frequent bathing isn't usually needed — the Keeshond scores low on doggie odor.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 18 inches tall and weigh approximately 45 pounds. Females stand 17 inches tall and weigh approximately 35 pounds.,"The Keeshond was bred more to be a companion than a watchdog. He's not a hunter, nor does he have an innate desire for any special job. He is, first and foremost, a devoted friend.He's also intelligent and highly trainable. He's so smart, in fact, that he can be a little mischievous. Expect the unexpected with these fellows. Despite this, the breed easily learns proper canine manners and can do well in the obedience ring.A Keeshond is a lively, alert dog, full of personality. When he's excited or happy, he likes to share his joy with everyone, often spinning in circles. His outgoing personality, as well as his love of adults and children alike, endears him to all.As with every dog, the Keeshond needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Keeshond puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Keeshonds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Keeshonds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Addison's Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this is an extremely serious condition caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones. Most affected dogs have a poor appetite, vomit, and are lethargic. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it's easy to misdiagnose this disease until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison's is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Glucose (sugar) is needed by the cells of the body to burn for energy; insulin is the key that lets the glucose into the cell. Without insulin, the glucose cannot enter the cell, so the cells are ""hungry"" even though there are high levels of glucose circulating in the blood. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try and compensate, but he'll lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin.Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Keeshond is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Keeshonds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","Having been bred first for life on a barge and later as a companion dog, the Keeshond has learned how to be happy in a relatively small space. He can live cheerfully in an apartment, a home with a large yard, or on a boat.More important than space is the Keeshond's need to live in the house with his family. Because he's a companion breed, it's essential that he be allowed to share as many aspects of his owners' lives as possible.If left unattended in the yard for hours on end, with little or no contact with his family, he'll become bored and his natural propensity to bark will intensify. He can become a nuisance barker if allowed. If you don't plan on spending quality family time with your Keeshond in the house on a daily basis, you should consider a different breed.While every dog benefits from exercise, the Keeshond does not require a great deal of it. He isn't generally considered to be the breed of choice for long-distance runners, for example. For your own health as well his, though, plan on at least one vigorous daily walk.The Keeshond is not fond of hot climates; he's happiest and most comfortable in cool weather. On hot days, keep him inside in an air-conditioned house or near fans. Some Keeshonds will also enjoy lounging in a small children's wading pool filled with cool water.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Keeshond in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Keeshond, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Keeshond look is fabulous, with his thick, double top coat, woolly undercoat, and a longer outer (or guard) coat. His mane is more profuse in males than in females. His hindquarters have ""trousers,"" longer hair down to the hocks. His tail is like a plume set on a lady's hat.The Keeshond color is a combination of cream, black, and gray. He has unique facial markings that seem to form spectacles, with a delicate, dark line running from the outer corner of each eye toward the ear.Surprisingly, the Keeshond's full coat is relatively easy to maintain. Matting isn't a severe problem, as long as you brush him at least twice a week. He does shed profusely twice a year, when he ""blows"" or sheds his entire undercoat all at once. This shedding period can be intense and can last for three weeks.Keeshonds are relatively clean dogs; their doggie odor is minimal. Bathing is necessary about every three months or so (more often, of course, if he rolls in something smelly or plays in mud).Given the breed's heavy coat and intolerance to heat, you might think it's wise to shave down the coat in the summer. Not so — the coat actually insulates, keeping the Keeshond cool and protecting him from sunburn. Brush, don't shave.Trim his nails once a month, and his ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.Brush your Keeshond's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Keeshond to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Keeshond is a great pet for families with children. He's a playful, good-natured companion for kids of all ages. And as long as he is well socialized and well trained, the Keeshond gets along well with other dogs and pets.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.",Consider adopting a Keeshond from a rescue group before going to a breeder.The Keeshond Club of America,"Keeshond Club of America, Inc."

You'll need a lot of patience and firmness, plus a good sense of humor, when training this breed.The Kerry Blue is friendly to people, but his distaste for other dogs is well known. He can be aggressive and quarrelsome. Owners must be vigilant when taking the Kerry Blue in public. If he's socialized and well trained, he probably won't pick a fight, but he might try to end it if he's taunted.Keeping your Kerry Blue groomed is expensive and, if you do it yourself, it's hard work.Like all terriers, the Kerry Blue can be feisty. He loves to dig, chase, chew, and sometimes bark.This is an active breed. He needs plenty of exercise, every day. A yard to play in is best, combined with daily walks.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 18 to 19.5 inches tall. Females stand 17.5 to 19 inches tall. Males and females weigh 33 to 40 pounds.,"The Kerry Blue is a hard-working, independent, and athletic dog with plenty of energy and stamina. Like most terriers, he is prone to dig, chase, and bark (occasionally). If you are considering a Kerry Blue, think about whether or not you are willing to live with his propensity toward these behaviors. If so, you will be delighted with the Kerry Blue's fun-loving, even silly, attitude.The Kerry Blue is an active breed, and he needs plenty of exercise — mental and physical. Don't leave him alone for long periods of time, or he is likely to become bored, which leads to the destructive behaviors mentioned above. Training is essential to teach him proper canine manners. And as delightful as he is, the Kerry Blue does not get along well with others. He tends to fight with other dogs and chase small animals he perceives as prey.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Kerry Blue needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Kerry Blue puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Kerry Blue are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Kerry Blue will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Kerry Blue, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Entropion: Entropion is the inward rolling of the eyelid, usually the lower one, and found in both eyes. It causes vision loss and irritation, and generally occurs before a dog turns a year old. Corrective surgery when the dog reaches adulthood is an effective treatment.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Skin Cysts: It's not unusual for the Kerry Blue to develop lumps and bumps, usually epidermal cysts or sebaceous gland cysts that don't cause a problem. If a cyst ruptures, however, it can become infected.Cancer: Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.Keratoses: Keratoses (of the nose and foot) is the development of corns, warts, and calluses on the feet or nose. Often painful, corns can be inherited and are associated with thin pads or flat feet. Keratoses can be removed surgically or treated with antibiotics and corticosteroids.Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Dry Eye: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca and pigmentary keratitis are two conditions seen in Kerry Blues and can occur at the same time, or individually. Dry eye is caused when the eyes don't produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform tests to determine if this is the cause, which can be controlled with medication and special care. Pigmentary keratits is a condition that causes black spots on the cornea, especially in the corner near the nose. If the pigment covers the eye, it can cause blindness. Your vet can prescribe medication that will help keep the eyes moist and dissolve the pigment. Both of these eye conditions require life-long therapy and care.Chronic Otitis Externa: This is a chronic infection of the outer ear canal, often caused by excessive hair in the ear that fosters bacterial and fungal growth. The Kerry Blue can be prone to infection. Treatment includes cleaning the ears and plucking the hair growing inside the canal.Progressive Neuronal Abiotrophy (PNA): This is a rare, inherited nerve disorder. Symptoms usually appear when the dog is between 2 and 6 months of age. By the time the dog is a year old, he can't stand up. There is no treatment, nor are there any tests that determine if breeding dogs are carriers of the condition. Research is underway to create testing for breeding stock.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Factor Xl Deficiency (Plasma Thromboplastin Antecedent Deficiency): This is a rare inherited blood clotting abnormality that is characterized by severe bleeding after surgery or trauma. As the name implies, it's caused by a deficiency of the factor XI in the blood-clotting mechanism.","The Kerry Blue Terrier is a powerful, agile, and athletic dog who requires regular exercise. While some Kerry Blues will exercise themselves in a securely fenced back yard, others do not.Not only will a daily walk maintain muscle tone and keep a Kerry fit and trim, it will provide the necessary stimulation and socialization to keep him mentally alert. The Kerry Blue who lives in an apartment or condo requires at least three daily walks, even if it's raining or the temperature is below freezing.Training and socialization is essential for the Kerry Blue, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your Kerry Blue with you to many different places — the pet supply store, outdoor events, or long walks in busy parks — anywhere there are a lot of people to meet and sights to see.Remember, though, that he has a tendency to quarrel with other dogs. Also: if you don't have children, but may in the next few years, the Kerry Blue must be socialized early to them.The Kerry has a mind of his own and requires a firm but loving hand to show what is expected from him. He instinctively wants to please, and with positive reinforcement and praise, learns quickly. Harsher techniques aren't useful with a Kerry, because despite his toughness, he is surprisingly sensitive.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

He needs daily brushing, plus trimming and bathing every four to six weeks.Most owners opt to hire a professional groomer to trim the Kerry Blue, though finding one who knows the correct Kerry trim can be difficult. An uncommon breed, the average groomer doesn't have much experience with it; you might end up with your Kerry Blue looking like a Schnauzer or a Poodle.Your best option is to choose a groomer who certified with a national certifying agency. While certification is not mandated legally (like kennel licensing), it does show ongoing education. Also, owners can find a state-by-state listing of experienced groomers at The Kerry Blue Foundation website.Brush your Kerry Blue's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection.

He is good-natured, and isn't normally grouchy with children.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.He is grouchy, even aggressive, with other dogs, though with socialization and training — and altering — this tendency can be minimized. Never let your guard down, though, when the Kerry Blue is around other dogs, especially those unfamiliar to him.The Kerry Blue isn't especially fond of small animals either, given his strong prey drive. His instinct tells him to chase, so keep him leashed in public. The best way to ensure he'll get along with cats or small mammals in his home is to raise him with them and introduce them properly. Following that, close supervision is advised.",Kerry Blues are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

It's important to find a good breeder to make sure you don't get a puppy who will develop health or behavior problems.Although an apartment or condo is not the ideal living space for a Komondor, he can adjust to that lifestyle if he receives daily exercise and is trained not to bark excessively.This strong-willed dog needs a confident owner who can provide leadership the Komondor will respect. This isn't a good choice for the first-time dog owner.Although Komondor shouldn't be brushed, their coat needs extensive care to keep its white color and to stay free of dirt, debris, and parasites. If you want your Komondor's coat to stay clean, he should sleep indoors.Komondor are barkers and suspicious of most things they see or hear. The breed is an excellent watch dog for both home and livestock and was originally developed for this role.Komondor can be aggressive to other dogs.Komondor aren't high-energy, and are happy just watching and following you around the house. But they still need daily exercise of at least a few walks per day to keep them healthy and at their proper weight.A high fence is required to prevent the Komondor from attempting to expand his territory, a common habit of guard dogs.The Komondor is happiest when he's working. He's ideal for guarding livestock, but any job will give him the mental exercise he needs.Although Komondor historically spent their time outside protecting the flock, they do need time inside with their family. Like any dog, a Komondor can become aggressive, fearful, or aloof when deprived of human company.",The Komondor male stands 27.5 inches tall and up and weighs 100 or more pounds; a female is 25.5 tall and weighs 80 or more pounds.,"Komondor puppies take a long time to reach maturity — generally three years or so — but when they do, they have a calm, devoted personality. They're intelligent, independent, and fiercely protective, willing to rise to the challenge of defending home and family. Komondor are wary of strangers and can be aggressive to other dogs.These traits, plus their large size, make them a bad match for first-time or timid owners.Komondor need early and extensive socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — starting in early puppyhood. Enrolling your Komondor in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Keep up his socialization by continually exposing him to lots of different people. Invite visitors over regularly and take him along on outings and walks.","Komondor are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Komondor will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Komondor, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or PennHIP clearances for hips.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.Hip Dysplasia: This degenerative disease occurs when the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development and is found in many breeds of dogs.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Komondor has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically when the dog reaches maturity.Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death in a dog if it is not treated.","When he's young, this intelligent breed is surprisingly easy to train. That ease is often short lived, however, and turns into frustration when the apt pupil turns into a stubborn student. Komondor are independent as well as smart.The key to training a Komondor is not force or repetition, but making training fun for both owner and dog. The Komondor's ability to think for himself will lead him to decide that some commands are worth learning, some aren't worth repeating, and some are okay only once in a while. He becomes bored easily, so make each training session different.Komondor have moderate exercise needs and are satisfied with two or three short walks daily or playtime in the yard. They need a securely fenced yard to help them define their territory and, because they're so protective, to prevent other people and animals from entering that territory.","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Komondor are prone to bloat, a potentially life-threatening condition. To help prevent bloat, feed two or three small meals daily rather than one large meal.To keep a Komondor's weight at a normal level, feed him at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he's putting on the pounds. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they're buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your Komondor will be just as happy to get a fingernail-sized training treat as a bigger biscuit.For more on feeding your Komondor, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Komondor has a wonderfully unique coat. During puppyhood, he has soft curls that grow heavy as he matures, developing into long, feltlike cords that resemble the strands of a mop. The undercoat is soft and woolly, the topcoat coarse. Puppies have a cream or buff shading to their coats, but this color fades to white as they grow up.The Komondor coat doesn't need brushing, but it's definitely not maintenance-free. When the cords begin forming at eight to 12 months of age — a process in which the soft undercoat is trapped by the topcoat — it's essential to keep the hair clean and dry so it doesn't get dirty and discolored. The cords may not completely form until the dog is 2 years old.The cords must be separated regularly to prevent matting and to remove debris or dirt. Trimming around the mouth is suggested to avoid staining from food. And bathing and drying a Komondor is an all-day affair. Floor fans are excellent for post-bath drying, and many Komondorok will laze around in front of a fan. The coat can be trimmed short for ease of maintenance, although this takes away from the breed's distinctive appearance.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Komondor's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Komondor jumps up to greet you.Start getting your Komondor used to being examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Komondor can be good companions to children in their own family, but may have difficulty accepting visiting children. They're best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Always supervise Komondor when they're with children, and never leave them alone with young children. They're livestock guardians, not babysitters.Even when exposed to them often, Komondor are generally not fond of other dogs. They do best in a single-dog home but can learn to get along with cats. They're always pleased to have livestock to guard. That is, after all, their purpose in life.","Sometimes Komondorok are acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs may end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

Brushing them at least once a week, and preferably every two to three days, is recommended.Like many large dogs, the Kuvasz may develop joint problems if exercised too much while he's still growing. Don't push your Kuvasz to over-exercise, jump excessively, or go up and down stairs too often until he's passed his second birthday.Kuvaszok are suspicious of strangers and can be overly protective. Obedience training is imperative when you own a large guarding dog such as a Kuvasz.Although he's pretty self-sufficient, a Kuvasz doesn't like to be kept apart from his family. Like all dogs, he does best spending at least part of his time with you in the house rather than being left alone in the backyard. There really is no such thing as a ""good backyard dog.""Your Kuvasz can become aggressive and frustrated if kenneled, tethered, or chained. This is a breed that needs to run. He needs a large, fenced yard as well as a long daily walk or run once he's physically mature.Kuvaszok are intelligent and like many guarding dogs, they think for themselves. Training can be difficult and requires a lot of patience, time, and consistency.Although they're very gentle with children if they were raised with them, Kuvaszok puppies can be rambunctious and may accidentally knock over a small child.Your Kuvasz may consider any children other than the kids in your family to be threats. Opt to be safe rather than sorry, and when other kids come over to play, watch your Kuvasz carefully or put him in a secure area.Never allow anyone to reprimand your Kuvasz. If he feels that the person who's reprimanding him isn't ""worthy"" to do so, he will resent it.",Males are usually 28 to 30 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 100 to 115 pounds. Females are 26 to 28 inches tall and weigh 70 to 90 pounds.,"The Kuvasz is a spirited dog of keen intelligence, determination, courage, and curiosity, sensitive to praise and blame. He's devoted to protecting his family, especially children, and is suspicious of strangers. If a family member appears to be in danger, he acts on his own initiative. Adult Kuvaszok are gentle and patient with children, but puppies can be too rambunctious for young kids.This is a bold and independent dog who needs confident, patient training. This isn't the breed for a first-time or timid dog owner.","Kuvaszok are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Kuvaszok will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Kuvaszok, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip and elbow dysplasia (with a score of fair or better) and hypothyroidism. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site.Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than two years of age. That's because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it's often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.The following conditions may affect Kuvaszok:Canine hip dysplasia: This is a condition where the femur doesn't fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or by using the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs that have hip dysplasia shouldn't be bred. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. There are many new treatments that can help your dog if hip dysplasia is found.Osteochondritis Dissecans (OCD): This is a degeneration of bone that lies beneath the cartilage layer of joints. It's often seen in young, fast-growing dogs of the larger breeds. X-rays often are inconclusive. OCD usually appears during the growth phase of a young dog (six to nine months of age) and can affect the shoulder, ankle, or elbow joint. Because it is painful, the dog limps. Jumping off furniture and being overweight can contribute to the problem. Your vet may recommend complete rest and limited play for several weeks or surgery to remove torn cartilage pieces.von Willebrand's Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII antigen (von Willebrand factor). The primary sign is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other signs, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines may also be present. Most dogs with von Willebrand's disease lead normal lives.Gastric dilatation-volvulus: Also called bloat or torsion, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Kuvaszok, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, or exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised food dishes and certain types of food might also be factors. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it's recommended that dogs that develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.","Kuvaszok are active dogs who need a lot of exercise, and they're not suited to apartments or homes without access to a large, fenced yard. Even with a yard, they need exercise such as long walks or runs once they're physically mature. When left alone for long stretches, they can become destructive or aggressive.Because of their dense coats, Kuvaszok can stay outdoors in temperate to cold climates so long as they have shelter, water, and food. Like any dog, however, they also need access to the house, so they can be close to their family. Warm weather and high humidity make them uncomfortable.","Recommended daily amount: 2.75 to 3.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Kuvasz in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Kuvasz, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The dense white coat of the Kuvasz can grow to six inches in length. Expect to brush your Kuvasz a couple of times a week to prevent mats from forming, using a grooming rake, slicker brush, or pin brush. If your Kuvasz gets matted, use a large-toothed comb and a conditioning spray, along with your fingers, to gently work the mat loose. Kuvaszok shed heavily in the spring and the fall, and need more frequent brushing during these times.Unless he's sick or has been rolling in something smelly, the Kuvasz coat is odorless and repels dirt and water, so you won't need to bathe him often. In fact, bathing him too frequently could strip his coat of its natural protective oils, causing him to get dirty faster. Many Kuvasz owners clean their dogs' coats by sprinkling talcum powder or cornstarch into the coat, and then brushing it out. Trim the fur that grows between his toes, and trim his toenails as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long.Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Start getting your Kuvasz used to brushing and handling when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy vet exams and grooming sessions when he's an adult.","Kuvaszok are fond of children, and can be gentle and protective with them. If your kids are playing with friends, though, it's essential to supervise if a Kuvasz is nearby. He may mistake other children's play for aggression and will move to protect ""his"" kids. Kuvaszok puppies can be too rambunctious for young children.As with any dog, always teach children how to safely approach and touch your Kuvasz, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent biting or tail-pulling from either party.","Kuvaszok are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups in need of adoption or fostering. Other Kuvaszok end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you're interested in adopting an adult Kuvasz who has already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Kuvasz Rescue",not available

That said, as a mix between American Pit Bull Terrier and Labrador Retriever parents, you can expect Labrabulls to be medium in size--though they are typically on the larger end of medium.Most weigh in 45 to 90 pounds and range in height from 20 to 24 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger.The males typically run up to 30 pounds heavier than the females.","Labrabull parents usually describe them as being loving and loyal. Their high energy levels mean they would probably prefer a game of fetch to an afternoon nap. They love affection so make sure to give them some cuddle sessions at the end of the day.Labrabulls are easily frightened. If you are looking for a rough, tough dog, keep on searching. These pups may look tough, but they're big ol' softies. Labrabulls are also very loyal and protective of their family. If their family is threatened, they would not hesitate to display aggression.Labrabulls do well with early training, they are eager to please, and they thrive on positive re-enforcement. Make sure to establish yourself as pack leader and be consistent. They are intelligent with a sweet disposition.Labrabulls have a strong, muscular build. They are energetic and excel in agility training and sports. If you want a dog to exercise with, this may be your new best friend and favorite workout partner.Labrabulls would be just fine in single person households and families, but they're not recommended for novice dog owners. Their activity levels mean they may prefer a house with a yard; however, make sure that yard is secure, as some may exhibit wanderlust. For a highly active person with the right lifestyle a Labrabull would be just fine in an apartment.Labrabulls don't like being left alone for long periods and could display destructive behavior when isolated.","The Labrabull breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the American Pit Bull Terrier and Labrador Retriever also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Labrabulls suffer from include:OCDEpilepsyBloatHypothyroidism","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Labrabull's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Labrabulls are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one-plus hours of exercise per day. They have pent up energy and need to release it.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Labrabull's care will be maintaining their oral health. This breed is prone to tartar build up. Brush your dog's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove the tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Regular dental visits are strongly recommended.","An ideal Labrabull diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Labrabull's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Labrabull's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Labrabull coats are often a mix of their American Pit Bull Terrier and Labrador Retriever parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Labrabulls are black, white, gray, brown, yellow and silver. The vast majority of Labrabulls are black with white accents.They usually have short, sparse coats. These coats are very easy to groom. A good brushing per week will probably do with the occasional bath.Because of their short sparse coats, Labrabulls aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.","Labrabulls love children. Sturdy, energetic, and tolerant, they are ideal playmates. That said, no dog of any size or breed should ever be left unsupervised with children. When no adult can be there to oversee what's going on, dogs should be crated or kenneled.Don't allow children to pull on a dog's ears or tail. Teach them never to approach any dog while they're sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away.If your Labrabull has had plenty of exposure to other dogs, cats, and small animals and has been trained how to interact with them, they'll be friendly with other pets, too.Learn more about the Labrabull by reading about their parent breeds, the American Pit Bull Terrier and the Labrador Retriever dog breeds.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Labrabulls because they are a mixed breed.

As a newer dog breed, exact size standards might vary, but with Labrador and Great Dane heritage you can definitely expect your dog to be on the bigger end of the scale.Most weigh in at 100 to 180 pounds and range in height from 24 to 30 inches. Female Labradanes can sometimes be a little smaller than their male counterparts.","If you ask a Labradane owner how they'd describe their dog, you'll usually hear them talk about a loyal and friendly companion. The gentle giant reputation the breed has picked up is very warranted. This dog loves to hang out with humans whenever possible, although they might, on occasion, be wary of total strangers.Of course, due to the Labradane's huge size, this is also a mixed breed that needs a decent level of exercise. Brisk walks are great for them, and the Labradane is always a star at the local dog park. Just be wary that sometimes they can act a little goofy and not always realize the extent of their own size!It goes without saying that big dogs need big living spaces. But the Labradane's loyal streak also means that they can suffer from separation anxiety issues. A large family environment is preferred--this is not a dog for a single person living in an apartment situation.","Labradanes are generally considered to be healthy dogs--although the breed is a deep-chested dog, which can lead to digestive issues and bloat. The Labradane's parent breeds are also often prone to developing elbow and hip dysplasia. As ever, it's important to schedule regular wellness visits with your dog's vet.Some of the more common health problems Labradanes suffer from include:Hip and elbow dysplasiaBloatPanosteitis","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Labradane's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Labradanes can become obese due to overeating--consider serving smaller, monitored meals throughout the day rather than letting the dog free-feed.Twice daily walks are standard for a Labradane. If you're a runner, feel free to bring your dog along for a jog! Labradanes need to keep up a structured exercise regime through their life, not only to stay toned but to avoid any mobility issues that might arise from inactivity. The breed also likes to be mentally stimulated, so provide interactive toys and consider adding variety to play sessions and walking routes.The Labdradane's distinctive floppy ears should be wiped with a damp cloth at least once a week. This will help ward off infection.Consider brushing your Labradane's teeth a few times a week--although consult your vet for precise advice on how to do this.","An ideal Labradane diet should be formulated for a large-sized breed with medium energy. Labradanes need to stick to a heathy diet. They're often known for overeating, which can cause bloat and obesity and also result in mobility problems later in life.As with all dogs, the Labradane's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Labradane's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Brown, black, and white are the most common coat colors for Labradanes. The breed is usually the same color all over, although small markings might be present in some cases.Labradanes have short and dense coats. Their short hair should be brushed twice a week as part of a regular grooming routine, although in spring months you may notice slightly heavier than usual shedding, so update your regime as appropriate. Bathing your Labradane once a month is recommended.The breed is usually fine living in all climates--although, in hot weather, make sure that heat exhaustion is not a risk during walks.","If you have children, good news: The Labradane is usually great around them! This is a playful breed that enjoys forming close bonds with the humans in their life. Labradanes can also become quite protective of the people they live with. However, if you have very young kids, make sure to supervise play sessions as sometimes this gentle giant of the dog world forgets about its large size.The Labradane is usually tolerant of other animals, including dogs. Although always exercise caution before introducing new pets to each other.As with all dogs, early socialization pays off when you're adopting a Labradane--so make sure to reward your dog for good behavior and adhere to a proper training regime when you bring them home.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Labradanes because they are a mixed breed.

There has been some increase in multigenerational breeding (Labradoodle to Labradoodle), and also Labradoodle to Poodle or Labradoodle to Labrador Retriever breeding.Although the Labradoodle is not a recognized breed, the International Australian Labradoodle Association, along with the Australian Labradoodle Association and the Australian Labradoodle Association of America, are taking steps to create a breed standard and unite breeders. You can find a responsible Labradoodle breeder, or links to one, by visiting the Australian Labradoodle Association of America website.Labradoodles are playful and very loving with children, but they can be overexuberant and may knock down younger children unintentionally.The Labradoodle has three different coat types; depending on which coat yours has, you can expect her to be a non- to average shedder. Usually the Labradoodle doesn't shed excessively, but the Hair coat type is the exception to this rule.A Labradoodle needs one or two brushings per week, as well as regular grooming that includes ear cleaning and nail clipping.The Labradoodle can be a high-energy dog. She requires about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day.Labradoodles are intelligent and need to be mentally and physically stimulated. If they aren't, they can become destructive and hard to handle.Labradoodles do well with other dogs and pets.Apartments are not the ideal setting for this energetic dog.First-time owners do well with the friendly and amenable Labradoodle.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The Labradoodle comes in three size variations, depending on the size of the Poodle used for the first-generation breeding. The three sizes are Standard, Medium, and Miniature.The Standard Labradoodle should be 22 to 24 inches in height for a male and 21 to 23 inches in height for a female, while both can range in weight from 50 to 65 pounds.The Medium Labradoodle should be 18 to 20 inches high for a male and 17 to 19 inches high for a female, with both weighing from 30 to 45 pounds.The average size for a Miniature Labradoodle is between 14 to 16 inches and 15 to 25 pounds.","The Labradoodle is an intelligent dog who can make the ideal family pet if properly trained. She is friendly and accepts and treats everyone like her best friend. She is devoted to her family and enjoys life as an energetic companion.She can be gentle, but she can also be joyful, showing her happiness through exuberant jumping and playing. She also tends to be easygoing, since the Labradoodle was bred not to be aggressive. As is the case with any breed, some poorly bred ones aren't all that friendly, but a well-bred Labradoodle with a characteristic temperament is a true joy.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents--usually the mother is the one who's available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when she grows up.Like every dog, the Labradoodle needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Labradoodle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling her in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking her to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help her polish his social skills.","Labradoodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Labradoodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Labradoodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Ear Infections: These can plague Labradoodles because of their floppy ears. The ears trap moisture and should be regularly checked.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred--so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: Similar to hip dysplasia, this is also a degenerative disease. It's believed to be caused by abnormal growth and development, which results in a malformed and weakned joint. The disease varies in severity: the dog could simpy develop arthritis, or he could become lame. Treatment includes surgery, weight management, medical management, and anti-inflammatory medication.Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Labradoodle is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate for the fact that glucose (sugar) isn't getting into her cells to burn for energy, because of improper levels of insulin in her body. But she'll lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.","Labradoodles can adapt to just about any setting, but they're not recommended for apartments. They require about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day and would do better with a fenced yard in which to expel some energy. Some Labradoodles, especially in the first generation, can require even more exercise.The Labradoodle makes an excellent jogging companion but also needs some time off-leash to burn off steam. In addition, she needs to be intellectually stimulated; she's smart and energetic, so if she becomes bored, she can become a destruction machine.The Labradoodle is an intelligent and eager-to-please dog. Training should be easy as long as consistency and positive reinforcement are the methods. She can make a good companion for first-time dog owners since she doesn't need an overly firm hand. Socialize her from puppyhood, since she tends to hurl herself headlong into canine situations without regard to the feelings of other dogs. This can lead to some problems if the unknown dog is aggressive.Despite her activity levels, a Labradoodle can adjust to living in suburban or city environments and can do well in rural settings. Although she is used for various working roles, she's a companion dog through and through, and she should live inside the house, not out in the yard. She's happiest living in the comforts of home, sleeping soundly on your feet or in a bed next to yours.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Labradoodle doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things she shouldn't. A crate is also a place where she can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Labradoodle accept confinement if she ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Labradoodle in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and she shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when she's sleeping at night. Labradoodles are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on her size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Labradoodle in good shape by measuring her food and feeding her twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether she's overweight, give her the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at her. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on her back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see her ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, she needs less food and more exercise.Dividing your Labradoodle's food into two or more meals per day instead of a big bowl once a day can also lower her risk of gastric torsion, also known as bloat. The Labrador Retriever can suffer from this condition, and it's a trait that can be easily passed on to any Labradoodle offspring.For more on feeding your Labradoodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Although a Labradoodle can have one of a range of coat types, the desired length is 4 to 6 inches. She has a single coat with hair ranging from straight to loose curls. The curls shouldn't be tight and the coat shouldn't be thick or fluffy.There are three types of texture:The Hair coat, which is similar to fur in shedding breeds, is the least popular. Hair coats shed and usually have a normal doggy odor. This coat is seen in first generations, although breeders try to avoid it.The second texture, called a Wool coat, is dense and similar in feel to a lamb's wool, hence its descriptive name. Wool coats hang in loose curls and aren't dense. Generally, the Wool coat doesn't have a ""doggy"" odor and it's usually nonshedding.The Fleece coat has a silky texture often described as an Angora goat texture. This coat ranges from straight to wavy.Labradoodles are considered to be non- to low shedders, especially those with a Fleece or Wool coat. Hair coats tend to shed just as they do in other breeds, ranging from very low to average shedding.The Labradoodle comes in a wide variety of colors. These can be gold, apricot, caramel, chalk (a chalky white), black, red, café, cream, silver, chocolate, parchment, and blue. They can also have parti-colored coats, which consist of brindles, phantom, patched, or sable colors.Grooming requirements vary depending on the length and type of coat the dog has. Generally speaking, you can expect to brush a Labradoodle about once or twice per week. Some can be clipped or trimmed every six to eight weeks to keep the coat easy to maintain. A Labradoodle should only be bathed when necessary--which isn't often, as many of the coats don't have a noticeable doggy odor.Like Labs, Labradoodles can be prone to ear infections, so take a little extra time caring for their ears. Dry and clean them after a swim, and check them once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.Brush your Labradoodle's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding--and your dog may not cooperate the next time she sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Labradoodle to being brushed and examined when she's a puppy. Handle her paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside her mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Labradoodle does well with children and can be an affectionate and gentle companion for any child. She can also be exuberant and might knock down smaller children, but she will love them with all her heart.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Labradoodles usually get along well with other dogs and pets. Like most dogs, they need training and socialization for optimum success at living with and visiting other animals.","Labradoodles are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Labradoodles in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Labradoodle rescue.Australian Labradoodle Association of America RescuePoo-Mix Rescue",not available

Limit treats, give your Lab plenty of exercise, and measure out regular meals rather than leaving food out all the time. And be warned that the Lab's large appetite extends to people food and even inedible items. Labradors will forage in garbage, counter surf, and can make a meal out of chewed-up items like children's toys.Labrador Retrievers were bred for physically demanding jobs, and they have the high energy that goes along with being a working breed. They need at least 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. Without it, they can vent their pent-up energy in destructive ways, such as barking and chewing.Labs have such a good reputation that many people think they don't need to bother with training. But Labs are large, energetic animals, and like all dogs, they need to be taught good canine manners. Sign up for puppy and obedience classes as soon as you bring your Lab home.Many people think of Labs as a hyperactive breed. Lab puppies are definitely lively, but most will slow down a bit as they grow up. However, they usually remain fairly active throughout their lives.Labrador Retrievers are not known to be escape artists, but with the right motivation--such as a whiff of something yummy--a Lab will take off. Make sure your Lab has current identification tags and a microchip.","Males stand 22.5 to 24.5 inches, and weigh 65 to 80 pounds. Females stand 21.5 to 23.5 inches, and weigh 55 to 70 pounds.","The Lab has the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured breeds, and it's well deserved. They're outgoing, eager to please, and friendly with both people and other animals.Aside from a winning personality, they have the intelligence and eagerness to please that make them easy to train. Training is definitely necessary because this breed has a lot of energy and exuberance. The working heritage of the Lab means they are active. This breed needs activity, both physical and mental, to keep them happy. There is some variation in the activity level of Labs: some are rowdy, others are more laid back. All thrive on activity.","Labrador Retrievers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Labs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the elbows, but it has been seen in the shoulders, as well. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint, to the point that the dog is unable to bend his elbow. It can be detected in dogs as early as four to nine months of age. Overfeeding of ""growth formula"" puppy foods or high-protein foods may contribute to its development.Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don't impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthamologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they're bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision, as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Epilepsy: Labs can suffer from epilepsy, which causes mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your Lab has seizures, it's important to take them to the vet right away for a checkup.Tricuspid Valve Dysplasia (TVD): TVD is a congenital heart defect that has been increasing in prevalence in the Labrador breed. Puppies are born with TVD, which is a malformation of the tricuspid valve on the right side of the heart. It can be mild or severe; some dogs live with no symptoms, others die. TVD is detected by ultrasound. Research is ongoing to learn how widespread it is in the breed, as well as treatment.Myopathy: Myopathy affects the muscles and nervous system. The first signs are seen early, as young as six weeks and often by seven months of age. A puppy with myopathy is tired, stiff when he walks and trots. He may collapse after exercise. In time, the muscles atrophy and the dog can barely stand or walk. There is no treatment, but rest and keeping the dog warm seems to reduce symptoms. Dogs with myopathy should not be bred because it is considered a heritable disease.Gastric Dilataion-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Labs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, or drink large amounts of water or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid themselves of the excess air in their stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. Theyalso may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Acute Moist Dermatitis: Acute moist dermatitis is a skin condition in which the skin red and inflamed. It is caused by a bacterial infection. The more common name of this health concern is hot spots. Treatment includes clipping the hair, bathing in medicated shampoo, and antibiotics.Cold Tail: Cold tail is a benign, though painful condition common to Labs and other retrievers. Also caused limber tail, it caused the dog's tail to go limp. The dog may bite at the tail. It isn't cause for alarm, and usually goes away on its own in a few days. It is thought to be a problem with the muscles between the vertebrae in the tail.Ear Infections: The Lab's love of water, combined with their drop ear make them prone to ear infections. Weekly checking and cleaning if necessary helps prevent infection.","The lovable Lab needs to be around their family, and is definitely not a backyard dog. If they're left alone for too long, they'll probably tarnish their saintly reputation: A lonely, bored Lab is apt to dig, chew, or find other destructive outlets for their energy.Labs show some variation in their activity levels, but all of them need activity, both physical and mental. Daily 30-minute walks, a romp at the dog park, or a game of fetch, are a few ways to help your Lab burn off energy. However, a puppy should not be taken for too long walks and should play for a few minutes at a time. Labrador Retrievers are considered ""workaholics,"" and will exhaust themselves. It is up to you to end play and training sessions.Labs have such good reputations that some owners think they don't need training. That's a big mistake. Without training, a rambunctious Lab puppy will soon grow to be a very large, rowdy dog. Luckily, Labs take to training well; in fact, they often excel in obedience competitions.Start with puppy kindergarten, which not only teaches your pup good canine manners, but helps them learn how to be comfortable around other dogs and people. Look for a class that uses positive training methods that reward the dog for getting it right, rather than punishing them for getting it wrong.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Lab puppy. Don't let your Lab puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement until they're at least two years old and their joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, as is puppy agility, with its one-inch jumps.Like all retrievers, the Lab is mouthy, and they're happiest when they have something, anything, to carry in their mouth. They're also a chewer, so be sure to keep sturdy toys  available all the time--unless you want your couch chewed up. And when you leave the house, it's wise to keep your Lab in a crate or kennel so they can't get themselves into trouble chewing things they shouldn't.","Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on their size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Lab in good shape by measuring their food and feeding them twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether they're overweight, give them the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at them. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on their back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, they need less food and more exercise.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Lab puppy. These dogs grow very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. Feed your puppy a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.For more on feeding your Lab, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The sleek and easy-care Lab coat has two layers: a short, thick, straight topcoat, and a soft, weather-resistant undercoat. The two-layer coat protects them from the cold and wet, which helps them in their role as a retriever for hunters.The coat comes in three colors: chocolate, black, and yellow. Black was the favorite color among early breeders, but over the years, yellow and chocolate Labs have become popular. Some breeders have recently begun selling ""rare"" colored Labrador Retrievers, such as polar white or fox red. These shades aren't really rare--they're a variation of the yellow Lab.Grooming  doesn't get much easier than with a Lab, but the breed does shed — a lot. Buy a quality vacuum cleaner and brush your dog daily, especially when they're shedding, to get out the loose hair.Labs need a bath about every two months or so to keep them looking clean and smelling good. Of course, if your Lab rolls in a mud puddle or something foul, which they're apt to do, it's fine to bathe them more often.Brush your Lab's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Lab enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Their ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear. Because ear infections are common in Labs, also clean out the ears after bathing, swimming, or any time your dog gets wet. This helps prevent infection.Begin accustoming your Lab to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. Handle their paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside their mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Labrador Retriever not only loves kids, they enjoy the commotion they bring with them. They'll happily attend a child's birthday party, and even willingly wear a party hat. Like all dogs, however, they need to be trained how to act around kids--and kids need to be taught how to act around the dog.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.If a Lab has had plenty of exposure to other dogs, cats, and small animals, and has been trained how to interact with them, they'll be friendly with other pets, too.","Labs are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Labs in need of adoption and or fostering in lab rescue groups. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Lab rescue.National Labrador Retriever Club, Inc.",not available

This is especially so around young children--overly energetic play tactics usually won't antogonize the breed. True to the dog's social streak, they prefer to be around people rather than being left alone for long periods of time. So if you can offer a safe and fenced in outdoor space that you can also supervise, your kids and your Labrastaff will frolic away the afternoons very happily indeed.While Labrastaffs are usually great around humans, they can become wary of other dogs. For that reason, it's imperative that the breed is socialized and trained properly from day one.

It does, however, require a good deal of grooming.Lagotto Romagnolos can make good watchdogs if they are trained to bark when it is appropriate to do so. Without training, they may end up barking too much.As a truffle hunting dog, the Lagotto Romagnolo is good at scent work, but they also have a natural tendency to dig. Some owners give these dogs sandboxes or dedicated digging areas to avoid unwanted behaviors around the home.The Lagotto Romagnolo was accepted into the sporting dog category by the American Kennel Club in 2015.",Male Lagotto Romagnolos are larger on average than females. Males tend to be 17 to 19 inches in height and weigh 28 to 35 pounds. Females are usually 14 to 18 inches in height and weigh 24 to 32 pounds. Individuals of the breed may be smaller or larger.,"Lagotto Romagnolos were originally bred as hunting companions, and they haven't lost their ability to retrieve, even if it means jumping joyfully into bodies of water to do so. Many Lagotto Romagnolos naturally take to the water, and even if you don't plan to hunt, they'll still enjoy chasing down a toy in a good game of fetch. With their high energy levels and active spirits, they'll certainly appreciate the physical and mental stimulation. It is important that Lagotto Romagnolos get proper exercise or, like many dogs, they may get bored and create their own fun by digging and chewing things they shouldn't. They have sharp senses, especially when it comes to using their noses to sniff things out. That is why they are bred as truffle hunting dogs today. They are easily trained for nose work, though they can also perform well in other tasks such as agility and obedience training. When it comes to being a family pet, the Lagotto Romagnolo is an affectionate and laid-back dog, so long as exercise is provided in the form of at least one good, long walk per day, and preferably a game of fetch. So long as those needs are met, Lagotto Romagnolos are generally content, even when living in an apartment setting. Most of the maintenance required for a Lagotto Romagnolo will come from taking care of their coat, which needs plenty of grooming. They are loving dogs that are dedicated to their families, even children and other pets, though they do tend to bark at strangers who enter their territory. This can make them good watchdogs, but it is important to redirect and control barking instincts so they know when it is appropriate to do so, otherwise they may bark more frequently than you--or your neighbors--would like. Lagotto Romagnolos need companionship, so it is important not to leave them home alone for too long, and no dog should ever be left outside for the majority of the time. Without human companionship, you can expect to see plenty of unwanted behaviors, as you would with any breed. Overall, the Lagotto Romagnolo is an easy-going yet active dog that is a good choice for families with at least a moderate level of previous experience in dog ownership. Socialization training should begin as early as possible to make sure that they are well-behaved around new people and pets that they may meet.","The Lagotto Romagnolo is a generally healthy breed, though there are a few conditions that they are predisposed to. Breeders tend to test for these issues and avoid breeding animals that are able to pass the condition to their puppies, but it is always important to look out for health complications and maintain regular vet visits to stay vigilant. Some of the health issues that Lagotto Romagnolos face include hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, storage disease, juvenile epilepsy, cerebral ataxia, and neuroaxonal dystrophy.","Lagotto Romagnolos' teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Their ears and paw pads should be checked for signs of infection, parasites, or debris and kept clean. It is especially important to check their ears at least weekly, as their curly hair can grow in and around their ears and provide a haven for debris and parasites. You may need to trim or pluck this hair to keep the ears clean. Keep up with regular vet visits to maintain good health for your Lagotto Romagnolo.",A Lagotto Romagnolo dog diet should be formulated for a small-to-mid-sized breed with average-to-high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your individual Lagotto Romagnolo and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"Lagotto Romagnolos have double coats that are water resistant and are made up of hair, rather than fur. This means that their hair grows more slowly, doesn't shed as much, and tends to hold dander and allergens to the body, rather than dispersing them into the environment. For this reason, Lagotto Romagnolos are often referred to as a hypoallergenic breed. This trait comes at a price, though, as their coats tend to mat more easily. Hair can grow thick around the eyes and ears making it difficult for Lagotto Romagnolos to see when they are not groomed, and they can develop infections or trap debris in the ears. Lagotto Romagnolos must be brushed and groomed very regularly to avoid these problems. It is recommended that the length of the coat be kept to 1 to 1 and 1/2 inches. Grooming needs are higher than average for this breed.All of that said, the coats of Lagotto Romagnolos are beautiful and come in many colors. They can be cream, brown, orange, or golden, and they can either be solid-colored or have patches and markings of any of these colors in combination. They may also have a brown ""mask"" marking around the face.","Lagotto Romagnolos are capable of living peacefully with children and other pets so long as they are well-socialized, preferably from a young age. As with dogs of any breed, children should always be supervised during play, and they should be educated on how to properly and gently handle animals. Lagotto Romagnolos are generally playful and have high exercise needs, but it is important to make sure they don't play with too much excitement or they may risk knocking very small children over. When it comes to other pets, the Lagotto Romagnolo has a somewhat active prey drive, so they may be tempted to chase very small animals. However, socialization training will curb these tendencies, and Lagotto Romagnolos do not tend to have problems when it comes to adapting to multi-pet households.","The Lagotto Romagnolo Club of America is a non-profit group that will rescue and re-home Lagotto Romagnolos when they can, though the breed is still relatively uncommon in the United States, so it is rare for them to have dogs available. As the breed grows in popularity, you may see Lagotto Romagnolos in shelters more often, but for now, they may be hard to come by.

Reputable breeders do not sell to middlemen or retailers, and there are no guarantees as to whether the puppy had healthy parents with a nice temperament. Ask for references so you can contact other puppy buyers to see if they're happy with their Lakeland. Doing your homework may save you from a lot of heartbreak later.Lakeland Terriers are excitable dogs and have a lot of energy.They are a highly intelligent breed that can take advantage of an insecure owner and become the ""ruler of the house."" Be sure that your Lakie knows who is alpha in your household (hopefully, you!).Lakeland Terriers are prone to chasing other animals or anything else that might interest them. Keep them on a leash when you're in unfenced areas.Speaking of fences, it's best that you have a fenced yard for your Lakies to play in. Just be sure that the fence is very secure. They can be escape artists!Barking sometimes is a problem with Lakeland Terriers.Lakeland Terriers can be stubborn and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended.Lakeland Terriers tend to be possessive about their food and toys. Obedience training is recommended.Their terrier aggression can get out of hand without proper respect for their owners and training.","The compact and athletic Lakeland Terrier is typically 13 1/2 to 14 1/2 inches tall, and weighs 15 to 17 pounds. ","The typical Lakeland is bold and friendly. He's described as having a ""cock of the walk"" attitude, but he's neither overly aggressive or argumentative. All terrier, he's curious about everything, intelligent, and entertaining. He's usually reserved with strangers but loves his family, especially the kids. With other dogs, he might not start a fight, but he certainly won't back down from one. Alert and self-confident, he makes an excellent watchdog.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Lakelands need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Lakeland puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Lakeland Terriers are a hardy breed and don't suffer from any known hereditary health problems. To help ensure that you get a healthy Lakeland puppy, choose a breeder who abides by the U. S. Lakeland Terrier Club code of ethics.","The Lakeland should live in the home with his people, not outdoors. Because of his small size, the Lakeland Terrier is good for apartment life so long as you train him not to bark at every noise he hears. He's active indoors and will do all right without a yard so long as you provide him with one or two daily walks of 20 to 30 minutes. If he has a yard, it should be securely fenced as he's a capable digger and escape artist. Don't count on an underground electronic fence to keep him confined; the threat of a shock is nothing to a tough terrier who wants to go after something. Ideally, he should be able run and play off leash regularly in a safe area.Keep the Lakie on leash when you walk him. You never know when his terrier instinct to hunt will kick in.With his independent nature, the Lakie can be a challenge to train. Keep your sense of humor at the ready, as well as a large supply of patience. Be firm and consistent, but use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play to get the most out of him. Keep lessons short, sweet, and entertaining, and you'll find that your Lakeland is quite intelligent and capable of learning whatever you can teach.Housetraining can sometimes be a problem with this breed. Patience and consistency are musts. Take him out to potty first thing in the morning, after every meal, after naps and playtime, and just before bedtime. Reward him every time he potties outdoors. Crate training helps as well.Beyond housetraining, crate training is a kind way to ensure that your Lakeland doesn't get into things he shouldn't. Like every dog, Lakies can be destructive as puppies. Crate training at a young age will also help your Lakeland accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Lakeland in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Lakies are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.The Lakeland excels as a watchdog, but he can be noisy. Keep this in mind if he'll be living in an apartment or condo community.","Recommended daily amount: 1 cup of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your adult Lakeland in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Lakeland, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.""","Lakeland Terriers have a thick, hard topcoat and a soft undercoat. When he's hand stripped to show his outline, he has a neat, workmanlike appearance. In the show ring, the coat on the head, ears, forechest, shoulders, and behind the tail is trimmed short and smooth. The coat on the body is about half an inch to an inch long and can be straight or slightly wavy. The long hair on the legs, known as furnishings, gives the legs a cylindrical appearance. The hair on the face is trimmed but left longer over the eyes to enhance the head's rectangular appearance.Lakies come in many colors, including blue, black, liver (a deep reddish-brown), red, and wheaten (pale yellow or fawn). Some have a tan saddle that covers the back of the neck, back, sides, and up the tail, making them blue and tan, black and tan, or liver and tan. They can also be what's called red grizzle or grizzle and tan. A red grizzle Lakeland has a saddle that's a deep, rich red over a tan base. Grizzle is a mixture of black or red hairs with white hairs. Puppies often are born dark.Lakelands don't shed much, especially if their coat is kept stripped. Stripping is a technique that involves plucking the dead hair by hand or removing it with a stripping knife or other stripping tool. Your Lakeland's breeder can show you how to strip the coat, or you can find a professional groomer who knows how to do it (not all do). For easier care, you can clipper the coat, but the texture and color will become softer and lighter. That doesn't affect the Lakeland's ability to be a great companion, though.Spend 15 to 30 minutes a week to brush and comb your Lakie. Then give him a rubdown with a towel to remove any dirt and excess body oils. If you do this regularly, you shouldn't need to bathe him often unless he's rolled in something stinky. Remove loose hair from inside the ears and trim excess hair between the pads of the feet.Other grooming needs include nail care and dental hygiene. Trim your Lakeland's nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. The earlier you introduce your Lakie to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is.Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week — daily is better — to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so he'll be used to it.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Lakies love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but certain rules apply to child-dog interactions. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Lakelands can get along well with other pets, especially if they're introduced to them in puppyhood. They shouldn't be aggressive toward strange dogs, but they won't back down from them either. They may chase outdoor cats as well as squirrels and other wildlife, and they probably shouldn't be trusted alone with pocket pets such as hamsters and gerbils.",Lakeland Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Don't expect too much too soon.The beautiful Lhasa coat needs a lot of grooming. Expect to do a lot of work, or to pay a professonial groomer.Dental care is essential. Brush the Lhasa's teeth regularly, and have your veterinarian check his teeth and gums periodically.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 10 to 11 inches high and weigh 13 to 15 pounds; females are slightly smaller.,"The Lhasa Apso personality is a special and interesting mix. He's a happy, mischievous, and playful dog; he's also regal, independent, and fierce. He takes the job of guarding his home and family seriously; he also takes a long time to grow up, and even then he remains somewhat puppyish until old age.The Lhasa may be small, but he isn't a bit fragile. He's sturdy and strong, and he's naturally wary of strangers. He will make friends, but not until he knows that an individual poses no threat. He's an excellent watchdog.The independent Lhasa likes to be ""top dog."" Training and socialization, beginning with puppy classes, are essential. They'll teach him good canine manners and prevent him from thinking he can rule the roost. Lhasa owners must be strong, kind leaders.The Lhasa is not extremely active and is content living indoors. Unlike many other breeds, he doesn't need vigorous exercise to reduce nervous energy. However, he does enjoy and benefit from short walks and play sessions.The Lhasa likes to stay close to his family, following them room to room to join in the activities or sit on a lap. However, because of his independent nature, he's fine when left alone at home for reasonable amounts of time. The Lhasa doesn't usually suffer from separation anxiety.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.","Lhasas are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Lhasas will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Lhasas, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Cherry Eye: This malady occurs when the gland known as the third eyelid swells. It looks like a red mass — a cherry — at the inner corner of the dog's eye. The treatment for cherry eye is usually surgery.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Lhasa Apso is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Sebaceous Adenitis (SA): This is a serious problem in dogs. This genetic skin condition is difficult to diagnose and often is mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed for unknown reasons, and they're eventually destroyed. Affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin with hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin, an unpleasant odor, and secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if SA is suspected. Treatment options vary.Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca: Commonly known as dry eye, this is an inflammation of the eye that occurs when the tear production is deficient. The symptoms, a gooey yellow discharge, can be mistaken for conjunctivitis. Treatment includes medication, artificial tears, and sometimes surgery.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Familial Inherited Renal Dysplasia: This is a developmental or genetic defect of the kidneys, which are noticeably small and irregular in shape. The disease varies in severity: severely affected puppies are excessively thirsty and small for their age, and they often suffer renal failure. Mildly affected dogs may show no symptoms.","The Lhasa is a great choice for people with limited space. He's well suited for apartment or condo living, though he does enjoy playing outside in a fenced yard.The Lhasa is content with several short walks each day. He is not high-energy dog, and he doesn't tend to bounce off the walls when cooped up on a rainy day. He's happy sitting in your lap, wandering around the house, playing with his toys, and alerting you to passersby.Housetraining the Lhasa can be challenging, so it's wise to crate train. Also, remember that this dog will likely take a long time to mature mentally. He may reach full size at one year of age, but his behavior will still be quite puppyish. Be especially patient during training — keep it positive and consistent, and be willing to go the long haul.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Lhasa in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Lhasa, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Lhasa coat is gorgeous. Normally it is long, straight, and dense. It comes in many colors, including honey, black, white, slate, or parti-color.Keeping the Lhasa coat gorgeous, however, is time-consuming and difficult. Regular, even daily, brushing and combing are necessary, as is frequent bathing (every two to four weeks). Many owners elect to hire a professional groomer, because although a hardworking owner can learn to manage the Lhasa's coat, it's certainly not a job for beginners.In fact, it's not uncommon for owners to have their Lhasa's coat clipped short to cut down on grooming chores. The beautiful flowing coat is gone, but what's left is a lot easier to care for.Brush your Lhasa's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Lhasa to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Children are probably not at the top of the Lhasa's list of favorite things. He tends to be intolerant of the normal antics of children, and he'll nip. The Lhasa is best suited to a home with older children who understand how to properly handle him. He's not advised for a family with young or rowdy kids.If he's properly socialized and trained, the Lhasa gets along with other dogs. He does like to be top dog, so he's often the leader, even around other dogs who are much larger. He isn't afraid to join in activities normally associated with large dogs, such as hiking or cross-country skiing. The Lhasa thinks he's a large dog.The Lhasa can get along with other pets as well, given proper introductions and training.","Lhasa Apsos are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur with old age and can be treated by surgically removing the cataract.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified on a yearly basis.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of Patellar Luxation ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.","Lowchen make excellent apartment residents, but they can be prone to excessive barking.

Crate training is recommended.Maltese are prone to chills, especially if they are damp or walking in damp areas.If your Maltese has long hair, he can get sunburned on the skin where the hair is parted on the back.Because of their small size and delicate structure, Maltese generally aren't recommended for households with toddlers or small children.Some Maltese have delicate digestive systems and may be picky eaters. Eating problems can occur if your Maltese has teeth or gum problems as well. If your Maltese is showing discomfort when eating or after eating, take him to the vet for a checkup.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The compact Maltese should weigh no more than seven pounds at maturity, with four to six pounds being preferred. Males should be eight to ten inches tall at the shoulder, while females should be eight to nine inches tall.Beware of breeders who offer ""tea cup"" Maltese. A Maltese that weighs less than four pounds at maturity is more prone to genetic disorders and is at a higher health risk in general.","The Maltese is a natural ham with a lively personality. Because he's so people-oriented, he takes well to training and responds to positive reinforcements such as food rewards, praise, and play.Fearless, Maltese assume that everyone they meet — human or animal — is a friend. Sweet and cute, they're widely known for always getting their way — even with people who have no intention of spoiling them.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Maltese needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Maltese puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Maltese are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions.

Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. A reputable breeder will have dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist.Hypoglycemia: This malady is caused by low blood sugar. Some of the signs may include weakness, confusion, a wobbly gait, and seizure-like episodes. If your dog is susceptible to this, talk to your vet about prevention and treatment options.White Dog Shaker Syndrome: This disorder that primarily affects white dogs. Signs of the condition are tremors over the entire body, lack of coordination, and rapid eye movements. Episodes usually start when the dog is six months to three years old and is stressed or overly excited. This condition isn't painful and doesn't affect the dog's personality. If you suspect your Maltese has White Dog Shaker Syndrome, talk to your vet about treatment options.Collapsed trachea: Some dogs are prone to this condition, in which the trachea, which carries air to the lungs, tends to collapse easily. The most common sign of a collapsed trachea is a chronic, dry, harsh cough that many describe as being similar to a ""goose honk."" Collapsed trachea can be treated medically or surgically.Reverse sneezing: Sometimes confused with a collapsed trachea, this is a far less serious condition and lasts only a few minutes. Reverse sneezing primarily occurs when your dog is excited or tries to eat or drink too fast. It also can occur when there are pollens or other irritants in the air. Secretions from the dog's nose drop onto their soft palate, causing it to close over the windpipe in an automatic reaction. This can be very frightening to your Maltese, but as soon as he calms down, the reverse sneezing stops. Gently stroke his throat to help him relax.","Maltese enjoy a regular walk or playing outside. They often remain playful well into old age. Because they are active indoors and don't require a great deal of exercise, it doesn't take a lot of effort to keep them in good shape.As a rule of thumb, wait until your Maltese puppy is 8 months old to walk very far with him, because his bones are still developing. Let your puppy play at his own pace in your fenced yard until he is mature, and then take him to your vet for a checkup before embarking upon a regimented exercise program.Maltese definitely are housedogs and don't tolerate extreme heat or cold well.

Maltese don't have the undercoat typical to many breeds and don't shed much.On the down side, Maltese coats mat easily and become dirty. In addition, Maltese are prone to unsightly tear stains on their faces.Gently brush and comb the coat of your Maltese daily, even if he has a sporty short trim. This helps to prevent mats and keep him clean. Beautiful though they may be, Maltese become dirty easily and usually must be bathed weekly.If your Maltese has long hair and develops mats, first try to work out the mat gently with your fingers, using a detangler spray or a coat conditioning oil. After you've pulled the mat apart as much as you can with your fingers, use the end tooth of the comb to loosen individual hairs. Never try to pull the entire mat out at once with the comb or brush, and make sure all mats are removed prior to bathing your Maltese as mats tend to get tighter when wet.You should check your Maltese's ears at least once a week. If they seem sensitive or have a bad odor, take him to the vet for a checkup. Also, Maltese grow a lot of hair in their ears that needs to be removed. Ask your groomer or vet to do this or to show you how to pluck the hair at home.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Tear and face staining are big problems for most Maltese owners. You should expect tear staining to begin when your puppy is four to five months old (that's the age that their adult teeth are coming in). To prevent or lessen tear- and face-staining of your adult Maltese, follow these steps:Clean the eyes daily with warm water to prevent tear stains, and wash your Maltese's beard after meals.Teach your dog to drink from a water bottle. Water that has a high mineral content can cause staining, so consider purchasing purified bottled water for your Maltese.Feed your Maltese from a stainless steel, ceramic, or glass bowl, not a plastic one. Be sure to wash your dog's bowl between feedings.If these measures don't clear up the tear stains, consult your veterinarian. Your Maltese could have clogged tear ducts, allergies, or other health problems that are causing the excessive tearing.While there are many products on the market to whiten your dog's hair, be very careful if using them or any home remedies. Many of them can damage your dog's hair, and never, never allow any products or foreign substances to get in your dogs' eyes.Many people put the hair on the top of their Maltese's head into a topknot to keep it away from the eyes. If you decide to do this, be sure to use coated bands that won't break the hair. Some people clip their dog's hair short, on its head or all over, so grooming is easier.Brush your Maltese's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.If you notice that your Maltese's cute black nose is turning pink, he might not be getting enough sunshine. Take him outside on a sunny day, or if it's too cold to do that, take him for a car ride. The type of bowl that he's eating and drinking from could also cause the pigmentation change. If it's plastic, pitch it. When a female is in heat, her nose can turn pink also.Begin accustoming your Maltese to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Most Maltese breeders will not sell puppies to families with young children. It's just too easy for a toddler to injure a tiny Maltese by dropping him, stepping on him, or holding him too tightly. He does much better in a home with quiet older children or adults only who will treat him with the care he needs.Maltese can get along with other dogs and cats if they are socialized to them at an early age. They're unaware of their tiny size, however, and must be protected from taking on dogs that are ten or twenty times their size.","Maltese are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Maltese in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Maltese rescue.American Maltese Association RescueNorthcentral Maltese Rescue","American Maltese Association, Inc."

Designer dogs aren't true breeds — they're crosses of two specific breeds. If you're interested in a Maltese Shih Tzu puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren't as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don't know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog.Maltese Shih Tzus are adaptable and will be active and outgoing in a busy home, or quiet and reserved in a calm home. They require daily exercise and do well with a good walk or romp in the yard.Maltese Shih Tzus can suffer from respiratory problems. Heat and humidity can aggravate these conditions, so a home with air-conditioning is best.Some bark, but they don't seem to be as noisy as other small breeds, including the parent breeds. They will alert bark, however, so they can make good watchdogs.Maltese Shih Tzus are low shedders, but they require daily brushing to keep their coats free of mats. The coat can be clipped every six to eight weeks.Loving and gentle, Maltese Shih Tzus can make an excellent companions to both children and the elderly, and to first-time or timid owners.Maltese Shih Tzus generally do well with other dogs and pets.Maltese Shih Tzus are intelligent and train easily.Due to their size, Maltese Shih Tzus can make excellent apartment residents, but they're happiest when they have a yard in which to enjoy the great outdoors.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Although there is no breed standard for the Maltese Shih Tzu, he's roughly 10 inches tall and weighs somewhere between 6 and 12 pounds.","The Maltese Shih Tzu is an adaptable, intelligent dog. He's likely to be active and outgoing, if not downright boisterous, but occasionally you find the laid-back and quiet personality.For a Maltese Shih Tzu, the most important aspect of life is family: nothing else matters as much as being with you. If he has that, everything else is negotiable. When good breeding stock is used, he has a nice, well-rounded temperament.He can be curious, which can occasionally get him into trouble. He's usually happy, however, and always ready for a good play session.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.The Maltese Shih Tzu needs early socialization and training. Like any dog, he can become timid if he's not properly socialized when he's young. Early socialization helps ensure that your puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling your young Maltese Shih Tzu in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, taking your dog to busy parks and stores that allow dogs, and going on leisurely strolls to meet the neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","The notion of hybrid vigor is worth understanding if you're looking for a Maltese Shih Tzu. Hybrid vigor isn't necessarily characteristic of mixed breeds; it occurs when new blood is brought in from outside the usual breeding circle — it's the opposite of inbreeding.However, there is a general misconception that hybrid vigor automatically applies to mixed breeds. If the genetic pool for the mixed breed remains the same over time, the offspring won't have hybrid vigor. And if a purebred breeder brings in a dog from a different line, those puppies will have hybrid vigor, even though they're purebred.Maltese Shih Tzus are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Maltese Shih Tzus will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.Before you bring home your Maltese Shih Tzu, find out if he's from a first-generation or multigenerational breeding (though multigenerational breedings are rare for this mix). If he's a first-generation dog, research the health concerns that occur in both the Maltese and the Shih Tzu. Regardless of generation, both parents should have applicable health clearances. Some disorders are caused by recessive genes that may not appear for generations.In Maltese Shih Tzus, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Patellar Luxation: also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.White Shaker Syndrome: This affects young to middle-aged dogs. The disease is seen in both the Shih Tzu and Maltese and has been seen in any crosses produced by either breed. Symptoms are uncontrollable shaking and an inability to walk. An episode can last all day. Treatment is usually corticosteroids for three to six months, after which time most dogs don't need additional treatment (although some may require low doses every other day to keep the condition under control).","The Maltese Shih Tzu is an adaptable dog who can change his habits to reflect the home that he lives in. He can be active and outgoing in a high-energy home, but he can also be calm and reserved in a quieter home.Regardless of personality, the Maltese Shih Tzu requires the same amount of care. He should have a daily exercise, but this can be as simple as a leisurely walk through the neighborhood or a fun game of fetch down a hallway or in the yard. Expect about 10 to 15 minutes of exercise per day.He can do well in apartments, but the ideal is a home with a small yard. Maltese Shih Tzus love the outdoors and will spend a significant amount of time playing and romping outside. A home with air-conditioning is suggested, since some Maltese Shih Tzus can suffer from respiratory problems that can be made worse in heat and humidity; don't let him stay outside too long or play too hard when it's hot and humid.Training is as important for Maltese Shih Tzus as it is for all dogs, and he can be trained with little difficulty since he's bright and eager to learn. He makes an excellent dog for first-time owners. Socialization is important, especially since the Maltese Shih Tzu is a social dog and loves to receive visitors or go visiting himself.He can be noisy and will alert bark when he sees something or someone suspicious; however, he's not as noisy as some other small dogs, and that includes his parent breeds. (That's the joy of the hybrid.)Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Maltese Shih Tzu doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your dog accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Maltese Shih Tzu in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. He's a people dog, and not meant to spend his life locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Maltese Shih Tzu in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Maltese Shih Tzu, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The coat of the Maltese Shih Tzu should be long, and soft and silky in texture. It should have some wave to it, but it should never be curly. Maltese Shih Tzus generally are white or white with tan markings on the body and ears, but they can sport a combination of other colors, such as black, brown, black and white, brown and white, and black and brown.A fine Maltese Shih Tzu coat requires care and needs daily brushing to keep out tangles and mats. Regular bathing keeps the coat soft and silky. He can be clipped to make grooming a bit easier, but he still needs to be brushed weekly at a minimum, and clipped every six to nine weeks.Maltese Shih Tzus can have some problems with tearstains under the eyes, like their Maltese parents; these may need to be treated with commercial tearstain removers. Keeping the area around the eye clean helps reduce staining.Brush your Maltese Shih Tzu's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Maltese Shih Tzu to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Maltese Shih Tzu is a friendly dog who does well with children of all ages. He makes an excellent companion for older, more considerate children, but he also loves the small kids.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.A Maltese Shih Tzu does well in homes with other dogs and pets and can thrive in multipet homes. He's social enough to want to play with everyone, regardless of species. He won't view your hamster as fast food, but it's always best to keep an eye on his interactions with any smaller pet.","Maltese Shih Tzus are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They need daily exercise — a good walk, romp in the yard, or a game of fetch will do the trick. Barking can be a favorite pastime for a Maltipoo. They make excellent watchdogs, alert barking to warn you of anything suspicious, but they may not be the best choice for noise-sensitive people or those who live in housing with noise restrictions.Maltipoos shed little. They're considered good for allergy sufferers, but keep in mind that there's no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog. All dogs shed dander and saliva, which carry allergens. The best way to find out if a Maltipoo triggers your allergies is to spend a lot of time with him.Maltipoos need daily brushing and monthly baths to keep their coats clean and tangle-free. Clipping the coat is also suggested.Loving and gentle, the Maltipoo gets along with kids. But because small Maltipoos could easily be injured, they're only recommended for families with children older than six who know how to handle dogs.Maltipoos are smart and can be easy to train.Maltipoos generally get along with other dogs and pets.Maltipoos can do well in apartments and homes alike. They have high energy levels indoors.Maltipoos are companion dogs and may suffer from separation anxiety if they're frequently left alone for long periods.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.","The Maltipoo varies in size, depending on whether the Poodle parent was a Toy or Miniature. Generally, Maltipoos stand 8 to 14 inches tall and weigh 5 to 20 pounds.","This is an intelligent, affectionate, fun-loving dog who generally gets along well with everyone he meets. Gentle and devoted, Maltipoos enjoy spending their days perched on their owner's laps or walking beside them. They can also be active and feisty, and enjoy a good play session just as much as they relish a long cuddle. They're alert and make excellent alarm dogs, but don't count on them to provide any kind of protection.Like all dogs, Maltipoos need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Maltipoo puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Not all Maltipoos will get any or all of these diseases, butit's important to be aware of them if you're considering this crossbreed.White Shaker Syndrome manifests as tremors over the entire body, lack of coordination, and rapid eye movements. Episodes usually start when the dog is six months to three years old and is stressed or overly excited. This condition isn't painful and doesn't affect the dog's personality. If you suspect your Maltipoo has White Dog Shaker Syndrome, talk to your vet about treatment options. Epilepsy causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be managed with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder, which can be hereditary or of unknown cause.Patellar Luxation, also known as ""slipped stifles,"" is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Portosystemic Shunt (PSS) is an abnormal flow of blood between the liver and the body. That's a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities such as poor balance, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, loss of appetite, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease affects many toy breeds. When your Maltipoo has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur, which connects to the pelvis, begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn't attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free. Prognosis is generally very good after the surgery and many dogs suffer only minor lameness, particularly during weather changes.Before buying a Maltipoo, it's important to research the health concerns that affect both the Maltese and the Poodle. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for patellas (knees) and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal, including a DNA test for progressive retinal atrophy (PRA).Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","Maltipoos are people lovers and should live indoors with their family, never outside or in a kennel. They make fine apartment dogs so long as they get daily exercise and aren't allowed to become nuisance barkers.The Maltipoo is an intelligent dog and takes well to training. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise, and you'll be successful in no time.Maltipoos are active, and they need daily exercise to stay healthy, happy, and out of trouble. Excess energy can lead to destructive behavior, and you might be shocked to know just how much damage a small, bored dog can do. Give your Maltipoo 10 to 15 minutes of exercise each day. A short walk, play sessions in a fenced yard, or a good game of fetch down a hallway will do the trick.Maltipoos can be noisy and will alert bark when they see something or someone that looks suspect.

It's medium to long in length, and ranges from slightly wavy to curly. The coat comes in a variety of colors, with the more common colors being cream, white, and silver.The Maltipoo needs daily brushing to keep his coat clean and free of mats. Many Maltipoos are clipped to keep them tidy and cool. Generally a Maltipoo only needs clipping once or twice a year, but his head will need a monthly trim.Expect to bathe a Maltipoo at least once a month to keep the coat soft and clean. Trim the hair around the eyes to keep it looking neat. Ears should also be kept clean since they'll trap dirt, debris, and moisture.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Maltipoo's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long.

Crate training is recommended.Manchesters are energetic dogs and like to go for walks. Be care in off-leash or unsecured areas; when their hunting instincts kick in, training is out the window. It's all about the chase.They bark, dig, and kill vermin and small critters, including pocket pets.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The Toy Manchester Terrier is less than 12 pounds, with the Standard weighing over 12 pounds and under 22 pounds. Overall, Manchesters are slightly longer than they are tall. Their smooth, compact, muscular bodies express great power and agility, which these little dogs needed for their original job of killing vermin and chasing down small game.","A Manchester Terrier adores his people and likes to be with them. A social creature, he is not well suited to being alone all day — he just wants to hang out with you.Though not particularly aggressive, the Manchester is a terrier bred to kill small animals, meaning it's not a good idea for him to live in the same house with rats and rabbits. While they are more amenable to training than some, Manchesters still have the terrier belief that they rule the world, and if you don't alter that perception, you are likely to end up with a little four-legged Napoleon.He can be headstrong, protective, and snappish if not raised properly, so these dogs should be thoroughly socialized when young to prevent potential problems. The Manchester needs thorough, firm training in order to protect him from the downside of his own nature.However, the same ""I got game"" attitude that so deftly allows them to fillet small rodents can work against them in training. You have to prove — without fail — that you are the leader. Consistency is critical because Manchesters are stubborn and determined. They are also intelligent, keenly observant, and perceptive, so you have to watch your p's and q's around them. If not, they'll take advantage of any inconsistency.As a group, terriers are barky, lively, bossy, feisty, clever, and willful. The Manchester is no exception. He must have regular opportunities to exercise and think because you really don't want to know what kind of trouble he can get into when he's bored (think about the combination of clever and stubborn and let your imagination run wild).He should attend obedience classes from an early age, both for the socialization and training, and he should continue going to whatever classes or competitions he enjoys the most to remain intellectually stimulated and physically spent.As with any breed, temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. Of course, unless you have most of the litter to choose from, you may not be able to select a middle temperament.","Manchesters are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Manchesters will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Manchesters, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Glaucoma: This is a painful disease in which pressure in the eye becomes abnormally high. Eyes are constantly producing and draining a fluid called aqueous humor — if the fluid doesn't drain correctly, the pressure inside the eye increases causing damage to the optic nerve and resulting in vision loss and blindness. There are two types. Primary glaucoma, which is hereditary, and secondary glaucoma which is a result of inflammation, a tumor, or injury. Glaucoma generally affects one eye first, which will be red, teary, squinty, and appear painful. A dilated pupil won't react to light, and the front of the eye will have a whitish, almost blue cloudiness. Vision loss and eventually blindness will result, sometimes even with treatment (surgery or medication, depending on the case).Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.Heat Bumps: These bumps may appear along his back if your Manchester stays out in the sun too long.","Your Manchester needs daily exercise and mental stimulation, a minimum of a half hour each day, including walks, runs, disc games, obedience, or agility. Hanging out alone in the back yard is not exercise; even if that's what you intended, your Manchester will spend the time waiting at the door asking to be let back in.Manchesters have a great need for human contact so they are always happier when you're hanging out with them. When you're not playing with your companion, puzzle toys such as Buster Cubes are a great way to keep that active mind occupied.Puppies don't need as much hard exercise as adults, and in fact, you shouldn't let them run them on hard surfaces such as concrete or let them do a lot of jumping until they're at least a year old. It could stress their still developing skeletal system and cause future joint problems.Manchester Terriers are clean, virtually odorless, and wonderfully adaptable, making them finely suited to living in apartments or houses, but less so to living outdoors. Manchester Terriers are not annoyingly active indoors; rather, most match their activity level to their owners, meaning that if you're a couch potato, your Manchester will likely lean that way too (of course, he'd prefer going for a run with you).If you have a tiny pack of Manchesters, they'll amuse each other and be a little more active indoors than if there were only one. In a single family dwelling, Manchesters should have a fenced yard.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Manchesters are not picky eaters and it's been said that he will eat anything that doesn't eat him first. Not surprisingly, he's prone to obesity. Keep your Manchester in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Manchester, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Thanks to that short black and tan coat (the only colors seen in this breed), Manchester Terriers are pretty low maintenance. Brush the coat once a week with a rubber or bristle brush to get rid of dead hair and prevent matting. They shed, although not excessively, and regular brushing keeps this under control. They blow their coat twice a year, shedding heavily every spring and fall.If you keep him brushed, your Manchester should need a bath only when he's dirty. Use a shampoo made for dogs to avoid drying out his skin and coat.Brush your Manchester's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Manchester to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Typically, a Manchester is devoted to his family and likes children but his small size makes him vulnerable to youngsters who aren't old enough to know it hurts when you yank his ears. Some breeders prefer homes without very young children. It helps to expose him to a lot of children, small and not so small, when he's young.Show your children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should be left unsupervised with a child.Manchesters and other pets depends on... the other pets. They are less scrappy than many terriers, but don't lose sight of why they were bred: to kill vermin. They have a strong prey drive. So while they generally do well with other dogs, cats might be pretty nervous around them, and small critters like rats, hamsters, and guinea pigs would be in permanent danger around this terrier.","Manchesters are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Manchesters in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They are not purebreds like their Mastiff and Labrador Retriever parents.The main colors of Mastadors are brown, black, yellow and brindle. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors.While Mastadors are fairly easy to groom, they are not a good choice for allergy sufferers.Mastadors love children. That said, they are large, active dogs and can accidentally knock a toddler down with a swipe of the tail. Always supervise play, even with a trained dog.","Most Mastadors weigh in at 85 to 160 pounds and range in height from 28 to 36 inches at the shoulder. That said, some can be smaller or larger.Males tend to be larger than females.","Mastador have the reputation of being one of the most sweet-natured mixed breeds, and it's well deserved. The Mastador is a sensitive dog who can become shy, fearful, or aggressive if mishandled. Never treat your Mastador roughly or allow anyone else, including children, to do so.Mastadors are usually polite but aloof around normal strangers but will grow protective of their humans if anyone or anything seems threatening. Usually that's all they have to do, but they can escalate if the threat doesn't go away. Early training will help you encourage them to engage in this protective behavior only when it is appropriate and to back down when you give the command. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization.","The Mastador breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Mastiff and Labrador also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Mastadors suffer from include:Elbow DysplasiaPulmonic StenosisCataractsRetinal DysplasiaCanine Hip DysplasiaObesityGastric Dilation Volvulus (GDV) or Bloat","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Mastador's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Labradors require more exercise than Mastiffs. The Mastador hybrid typically requires about one hour of rigorous exercise per day. Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Handle their paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside their mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when they're an adult.Your main concern when it comes to your Mastador's care will be maintaining their oral health.Brush your Mastador's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Occasionally, Mastadors have impacted anal glands. This happens when the dog is unable to naturally empty the glands by defecating. If you notice your Mastador ""scooting"" or obsessively licking their anal area, take them to the veterinarian or a professional groomer to have the glands expressed. You can also learn to do this yourself.","An ideal Mastador diet should be formulated for a large breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Mastador's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Mastador's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Mastador coats are often a mix of their Mastiff and Labrador parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Mastadors are brown, black, yellow and brindle. Sometimes their coats are solid, and sometimes they have a mix of colors. Their coats are pretty easy to groom and good brushing once a week should do. This is not an ideal dog for allergy sufferers.As far as extreme weather goes, they tolerate cold, better than warmer weather but not for long periods of time. They are an indoor dog. You may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.Begin accustoming your Mastador to being brushed and examined when they're a puppy. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet.

Mastiffs can overheat easily.Without exercise and stimulation, Mastiffs can become bored and destructive.The Mastiff is considered a breed with a short lifespan, but some Mastiffs have lived to 18 years of age. A dog is a lifelong commitment, and if you are drawn to the breed because of the chance of a short lifespan, you may want to reassess your choice.Mastiffs drool and are prone to gassiness, but other than that they are fairly clean. If their drool would bother you in any way, this may not be a breed for you.Mastiffs are not the best choice for families with very young children or frail senior citizens. A Mastiff can easily knock down a child or adult who's unsteady.Mastiffs can do quite well in apartments and homes with small yards if they are exercised properly, but they are not really recommended for smaller dwellings because of their size. The ideal living environment for a Mastiff is a house with a large yard.Mastiffs can have strong protection instincts and need to be properly socialized with both people and animals. If they are not properly socialized they can become fearful of new situations and shy of strangers, which could lead to biting.Socializing your Mastiff to other animals will help ensure that your Mastiff has a happy, healthy life. If Mastiffs are not properly trained and socialized they may develop aggression toward other animals, and their size and strength makes them dangerous if they don't know how to interact with them.Mastiffs have an easy-care coat, but they shed heavily.When Mastiffs reach adulthood and overcome their clumsiness and energy, they are wonderful companions who are calm, quiet, well mannered, and self-assured. They make excellent watchdogs, although they tend to not bark as much as other breeds.Mastiffs need training so they can be easily managed in spite of their size. Mastiffs are not recommended for new or timid owners. They respond best to positive reinforcement, especially if it involves lots of hugs and praise.Mastiffs snore, snort, and grunt — loudly.Mastiffs tend to be lazy and need daily exercise to keep from gaining too much weight.All dogs thrive when they are with their family in the house, and the Mastiff is no exception. He should sleep and live in the house, not in the yard. A Mastiff who is tied up in a yard away from his family will pine away or become destructive.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The minimum height for a male Mastiff is 30 inches at the shoulder; for females, it's 27.5 inches. Weight ranges from 130 pounds to 220 pounds or more.","The proper Mastiff should be a combination of grandeur and good nature, courage and docility. He's always dignified, never shy or vicious.A well-socialized Mastiff treats normal strangers with polite aloofness but will step between you and anyone or anything that seems threatening. Normally it's not necessary, but if the threat continues, he'll escalate his response as needed. Thieves who are foolish or unlucky enough to break into a home with a Mastiff will find themselves cornered until a family member arrives to call the police.Mastiffs dislike conflict between family members as well and will step between arguing spouses or a parent punishing a child. While he might look tough on the outside, the Mastiff is a sensitive dog who can become shy, fearful, or aggressive if mishandled. Never treat your Mastiff roughly or allow anyone else, including children, to do so.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Mastiffs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Mastiff puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Mastiffs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Mastiffs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Mastiffs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease. Mastiffs can be cleared of the dominant Mastiff PRA gene through a DNA test.Seizures: Seizures can have many causes, including epilepsy and trauma. Often, they can be managed with medication although not cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this condition.Cystinuria: Cystinuria is an inherited kidney defect. Kidneys filter the amino acid cystine and prevent it from going into the urine, but in dogs with cystinuria the acid goes into the urine. Cystine is then reabsorbed in the kidney tubule where it often forms kidney or bladder stones, which cause urinary blockages and urinary tract inflammations. If cystinuria is not treated, the blockages can prove fatal. Treatment needs to be rapid and usually consists of a drug that prevents stone formation. Seen more often in males, it can years before symptoms occur, if they occur at all. Not all dogs with cystinuria form stones. There is a DNA test available to determine if an individual Mastiff carries the genetic predisposition. It is important to ask your puppy's breeder if this test has been done on the parents of your puppy.Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Cancer: Dogs, like humans, can develop cancer. There are many different types of cancer and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, the tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically. In Mastiffs, osteosarcoma (bone cancer) is common. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs can adapt well to life on three legs and don't suffer the same side effects of chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss.","Mastiffs are housedogs. They can adapt to any environment, city or country, but they do best in a home with a fenced yard. Their exercise needs are moderate. An adult Mastiff will be satisfied with a couple of 20- to 30-minute walks daily.Because of their great size, they're not good jogging companions. They overheat easily, and their joints can be damaged from the stress of running. Walks are best scheduled for cool mornings and evenings. During the day, bring along water in case he gets hot.Puppies are more active and need free play in a fenced yard, but until they reach physical maturity at 18 months of age, it's important to limit jumping, long walks, and other exercise that could damage their still developing bones, muscles, and tendons. Let young puppies play, walk, or rest at their own pace.Once they're 18 months old, you can gradually increase the amount of exercise they receive to a moderate level. No matter what his age, learn to recognize your Mastiff's signs of fatigue, because he'll never let you know that he's tired; he wants only to please you.Mastiff puppies are nosy, curious, and into everything. Crate training is highly recommended. Not only will it keep them out of trouble and save your belongings from destruction, it's an excellent aid to housetraining. This breed is easily housetrained, but a crate will help him learn to control his bladder and bowels.Your adult Mastiff is just the right height to go counter-surfing, so keep food well out of reach. A swipe of his long, tapering tail can clear a coffee table. You might want to put breakables elsewhere.Mastiffs of all ages are chewers and will chew on anything that smells good or looks interesting. Be diligent in letting your Mastiff know what's okay to chew and what isn't. He still might eat your recliner, but if you've provided him with plenty of chew toys and exercise, he's somewhat less likely to do so.Obedience training is a must for this giant breed. He may be sweet, but a full-size Mastiff who doesn't have nice manners is unmanageable. The sensitive Mastiff is easy to train with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise and food rewards. Start with puppy kindergarten and go through basic obedience to ensure that you have a well-mannered, well-socialized dog who will react appropriately in any situation.","Recommended daily amount: 6 to 8 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Factors that contribute to bloat include eating a large meal and then drinking large amounts of water, heavy exercise directly before or after a meal, giving food in raised feeding dishes, and stress. Keep these things in mind when you feed your Mastiff.For more on feeding your Mastiff, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Mastiff has a short, straight outer coat with a dense, shorter undercoat. The coat comes in fawn, apricot, or brindle. Brindle Mastiffs have a fawn or apricot background color with dark stripes. The muzzle, nose, ears, and eye rims are dark, the blacker the better. They may have a small patch of white on the chest.Brush your Mastiff's coat weekly with a rubber hound glove. You may want to brush him daily during the spring and fall shedding season to keep flying hair under control. Some Mastiffs do most of their shedding during this time, while others shed year-round. A stripping blade can also help remove excess hair.Clean his wrinkles daily to prevent bacterial infections. Wipe them out with a damp washcloth and then dry them thoroughly. Do the same for the flews (the hanging part of the upper lip) after every meal.Brush your Mastiff's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems.

He has a spirited, confident personality that both delights and exasperates his owners. He's fearless, intensely curious, and always ready for action. He's got nonstop energy and is intelligent and vigorous. He's an excellent watchdog.The Min Pin might as well be a detective. He wants to investigate everything and, if he isn't watched closely, he'll get himself into trouble. Living with a Min Pin is similar to living with a toddler who needs constant supervision. When you aren't supervising, he should be securely tucked away in a crate. Obviously, crate training is highly recommended.Don't forget the Min Pin's penchant for escaping. He'll find weak places in the fencing or dash out the front door while you sign for a package. You have to be on your guard to keep this breed safe.The Min Pin doesn't lounge about — he's too busy for that — but he is affectionate and loving with his family. He loves to entertain, and he'll often play the class clown in order to get the attention he craves.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Min Pin needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Min Pin puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Min Pins are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Min Pins will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Min Pins, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This malady involves the hip joint, and many toy breeds are prone. If your Miniature Pinscher has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.","It is absolutely essential to set up safeguards to protect the curious Min Pin. You'll need to ""baby-proof"" the house just as you would for a crawling baby or a toddler.Make sure all small objects (keys, coins, kids' toys, and so forth) stay out of his reach. Medication can be a serious issue, because the Min Pin will find and ingest any pills that you chance to drop on the floor; be sure to put those away after every use.Go over your yard and fencing with a fine-toothed comb. Look for and fix any hole or opening, because if your hand can fit through it, somehow your Min Pin can too. Make sure all doors and windows, and their screens, are sturdy and secure as well.The Min Pin needs early socialization and training. Like any dog, he can become timid or quarrelsome if he is not properly socialized when young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Min Pin puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Because he really thinks he's a king, you must be a strong pack leader with the Min Pin. He's not a good breed for first-time dog owners; even if you're an experienced dog owner but you're new to the breed, it's helpful to work with a trainer who has experience teaching these vivacious dogs. The Min Pin can quickly get the upper hand. While you certainly don't want to rule with an iron fist, you must establish firm leadership.The Min Pin doesn't have a lot of fur, which means he's sensitive to cold. Buy him a doggie sweater he can wear during cold winter months.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Min Pin in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Min Pin, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Min Pin is extremely handsome in his short, sleek coat. Colors include red, black and rust, and chocolate and rust.Grooming doesn't get much easier than this. The Min Pin needs brushing every few days to keep his sleek coat shiny; a soft bristle brush or grooming mitt works well. Frequent bathing is not recommended because it dries the skin, though it's okay to bath the Min Pin when he rolls in something smelly or is very dirty.Instead of bathing, many owners simply wet a washcloth with warm water and wipe the Min Pin's coat. Begin with the face, paying particular attention to the area under the eyes, and work back toward the tail. If you do this every few days, the Min Pin will stay clean and healthy.Brush your Min Pin's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Min Pin to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","If a Miniature Pinscher is raised with children who treat him carefully and kindly, he will adore them and be a trustworthy companion. However, if children are allowed to grab or treat him roughly, even accidentally, he may develop a bad attitude toward kids, or at least want to avoid them as much as possible. The Min Pin is best suited for children age 10 and older.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Many owners have more than one Min Pin; properly socialized and trained, these dogs get along with other dogs just fine (expect some bossiness as they work out who's top dog). As far as other pets are concerned, the Min Pin's instinct is to chase, so he isn't well suited to homes with small mammals.","Miniature Pinschers are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Miniature Pinschers in need of adoption and/or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club, and they can point you toward a Miniature Pinscher rescue organization.Internet Miniature Pinscher ServiceMiniature Pinscher Club of America RescueSouthern Star MinPin Rescue, Inc.","Miniature Pinscher Club of America, Inc."

He's incredibly affectionate.A Miniature Schnauzer is intelligent, mischievous, and often stubborn. He's full of life.He's low-shedding, but high-maintenance in terms of grooming. He needs to be clipped every five to eight weeks or so.He's noisy. Protective of home and family, he'll bark even at slight noises.He's good with kids and other dogs, but not to be trusted around small mammals.Always keep your Miniature Schnauzer on a leash when you're not in a fenced area. If he sees something and wants to chase it, he will likely ignore your calls.A bored Miniature Schnauzer is an unhappy Miniature Schnauzer. Because he's intelligent and energetic, he thrives on varied activities and exercise. Make sure that you give him both, or he'll become destructive and ill-tempered.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Miniature Schnauzers are sturdy and don't look like toy dogs by any stretch of the imagination. They are usually 12 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder. Weight ranges from 11 to 20 pounds.,"A Miniature Schnauzer is full of life. An extrovert, he loves to be in the thick of the family action. He may even run up to you while you're sitting down and throw his paws around your neck. He wants to touch you and be next to you all the time, and you can bet he'll want to sleep plastered to your side.A bit of a spitfire, the Miniature Schnauzer is a terrier — that means he's full of himself. He's a feisty type A and his work involves amusing himself. He is not aloof or independent but needs to be with people, and what's more, he wants to be in close physical contact. (Your lap is no longer your own.)He's very intelligent, which makes training easy, but it also means he's a master of manipulation. That combined with his stubbornness will keep you on your toes. He's not as feisty as some terriers, however, nor as dog-aggressive.As with every dog, the Miniature Schnauzer needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Miniature Schnauzer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Miniature Schnauzers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Miniature Schnauzers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Cataracts: Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Entropion: Entropion, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Schnauzer has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Urinary Stones: These can cause your Miniature Schnauzer to start straining to urinate, pass blood in the urine, need to urinate more often than normal, and have cloudy or foul-smelling urine. While small bladder stones may pass on their own, your vet should be consulted. Dietary changes can't get rid of existing stones, but they can prevent more stones from forming.Myotonia Congenita: Only recently discovered in Miniature Schnauzers, this is a hereditary skeletomuscular disorder similar to muscular dystrophy. Symptoms begin when puppies are a few weeks old. Their muscles contract easily and they have prominent muscles in the shoulders and thighs. They have difficulty getting up, their coats are stiff, and they bunny-hop when running. Their tongues are enlarged and stiffen when touched, their lower jaws are peak-shaped, and they have difficulty swallowing. All breeding stock should be DNA-tested for the gene that causes it.Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.Congenital Megaesophagus: This is a condition in which food and liquid are retained in the dog's esophagus, causing him to regurgitate his food. As a result, dogs can get aspiration pneumonia or their esophagus can become obstructed. Diet can be adjusted to provide for the least regurgitation. The disease itself can't be treated, only resulting conditions such as pneumonia; and the prognosis tends to be poor.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Miniature Schnauzers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","The Miniature Schnauzer is active when inside the house, playing with toys and following you from room to room. He loves to have a yard to play in, but he'll do well without one if you give him a long walk every day. He needs 45 minutes of daily exercise — remember, a tired Miniature Schnauzer is a good Miniature Schnauzer.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Schnauzer doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Miniature Schnauzer accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your dog in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

A solid white Miniature Schnauzer can't be shown in American Kennel Club shows, however, so white ones are by definition pet quality instead (which makes no difference to the dog's temperament). Many Miniature Schnauzer fanciers dislike the white coat, feeling that if you want a white terrier you should get a West Highland White Terrier.He has a double coat. The top coat is wiry. Since the undercoat catches the loose hair, he hardly sheds at all. Because of this, many people think he's a perfect house dog, especially those who suffer from asthma.Miniature Schnauzers should be groomed every five to eight weeks to keep them looking their best. Most people take their Miniature Schnauzers to professional groomers to do this, because there are some tricks to getting that beautiful Schnauzer look. You can learn to do it yourself — just expect something less than perfection the first few times, and have a sweater at the ready in case you need to cover up the flaws.The coats of Miniature Schnauzers shown in conformation are hand-stripped, a process of removing dead hair. It's time-consuming and not something to be tackled by novices; it's for show dogs. Most professional groomers don't strip but use the clippers. Using electric clippers means that the wiry top coat will disappear, which is why it's not used on dogs shown in conformation.Brush your Schnauzer two or three times a week so he doesn't get matted, especially in the longer hair on his face and legs. Be sure to check his armpits, since this is a place where mats often form. It's also a good idea to wash his beard after he eats.Brush his teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems.

He's good with children, particularly if he's raised with them. He'll play with them and protect them and they'll help each other burn off steam: kids and Miniature Schnauzers are a great combination.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away.

He typically isn't as aggressive toward other dogs as many other Terriers are, but he is brave and fearless around large dogs, a trait that can get him into trouble. He is large and in charge, at least in his own mind.Small mammals such as rats and gerbils, however, aren't good matches for the Miniature Schnauzer, who is hardwired to kill them. Training won't change that; that's what he's bred for.",Miniature Schnauzers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They are not purebreds like their Maltese or Yorkshire Terrier parents.Morkie coats can vary in color, from black, brown, white, or a mix of these colors. Their coats can even change colors as they grow.Both of the Morkie's parent breeds don't shed much, and the Morkie inherited this trait. They are not, however, considered to be hypoallergenic.Morkies are small and can be easily injured. They'd do best in a home with adults or older children who know how to play gently.The Morkie is a small dog with a big dog personality. They have high energy and may be a bit stubborn when it comes to training.Morkies demand a lot of attention and may do best in a single-person or single-pet household. That said, they can be socialized, especially from an early age, and get along just fine with other people and pets.","As the Morkie is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Maltese and Yorkshire Terrier parents, you can expect Morkies to be on the small side.Most Morkies weigh in somewhere between seven to 13 pounds and range in height from four to eight inches at the shoulder. That said, some may be larger or smaller.","Many Morkie lovers describe the breed as loving ""fluffballs"" who love their humans and socializing with other people and pups alike. Despite their small stature, the Morkie has a big personality with the energy levels to match.Thanks to the Terrier in them, Morkies can be somewhat stubborn. Training may be a little tough, but with patience and persistence, a Morkie can learn to obey commands.The Morkie is also a great watchdog. If they hear or see something amiss, they will let you know! If you want a watchdog that will let you know as soon as someone is at the door, the Morkie might be a good fit for you.They also tend to latch on to one family member most of all, though they can get along with others in the house. Morkies may be best suited to a one-person home or smaller families, as they demand quite a bit of attention.","The Morkie breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Maltese and Yorkshire Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Morkies suffer from include:Collapsed tracheaDental diseaseHerniasReverse sneezingGlaucoma","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Morkie's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Morkies can be stubborn, and their energy levels are high. To prevent bored, destructive behavior, make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour walk per day, with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in. Luckily, due to their size, they don't need an excessive amount of exercise, and too much could actually injure them.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking loudly against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Morkie's care will be minding how fragile they can be. Yes, they are playful, energetic dogs, but they need to be cared for gently. Use a harness instead of a collar when walking them to prevent trachea collapse, and be sure that others are handling your Morkie with care.You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Morkie diet should be formulated for a toy to small breed with high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Morkie's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Morkie's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Morkie coats are often a mix of their Maltese and Yorkshire Terrier parents' coats and colors. Their coats can vary in color, from black, brown, white, or a mix of these colors. Many Morkie lovers also know that a Morkie puppy's coat color can change over time.Both the Maltese and the Yorkshire Terrier are considered non-shedding breeds, since they have hair instead of fur. They will need regular brushing to prevent matting of the hair or knots. Since they don't shed too much, they may be a good option for allergy sufferers. However, it is important to note that they are not considered hypoallergenic.","Since the Morkie is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Morkies prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Morkie can make a great, active companion.When it comes to other pets, Morkies can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. That said, Morkies can be somewhat demanding when it comes to human attention, and they may be best suited in a single-dog household.Still, many Morkies get along just fine with other dogs and cats, so it really comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Morkies because they are a mixed breed.

Most Mudis can still be found in Hungary, though some Mudis live in Finland and, rarely, other parts of the world.The American Kennel Club does not fully recognize the Mudi as an official breed, partially due to the rarity of these dogs. They do, however, include the Mudi in their Foundation Stock Service, which helps keep records of the breed's lineage and allows them to compete in certain competitions.The plural form of Mudi in Hungarian is ""Mudik."" Some use this word instead of ""Mudis"" even outside of the Hungarian language.Mudi coats come in a variety of colors, including black, brown, white, fawn, grey, or a marbled mix of black and grey.",The Mudi is a small to medium-sized dog that typically measures between 14 and 20 inches at the shoulder and on average weighs 18 to 29 pounds. Individuals of the breed may also be smaller or larger.,"Eager to please and full of enthusiasm for any task they are given, Mudis are valued by shepherds for their ability to think on their paws and keep flocks safe and in line without much supervision. With their high intelligence and alertness, they are also easily trainable and well-suited for other jobs like search and rescue, dog sports, hunting rodents, and more. Mudis are not overly trusting of strangers, and they are quick to bark when something is out of the ordinary, which makes them excellent watchdogs. They should, however, be socialized and trained from an early age so they are not standoffish around guests and know when to quiet down. Mudis have high exercise needs and require adequate mental stimulation, or they may get bored and engage in destructive behavior. They'll need at least a few good walks each day, and it's ideal if they have a chance to run for a while. So long as their exercise needs are met, they're happy to be calm, inside dogs, though they may do better with a large, fenced-in yard than an apartment. Mudis love personal attention and human companionship, and they typically latch on to one human family member more than the rest. They have a habit of following that family member closely and may get caught underfoot sometimes. Positive reinforcement-based training will be highly effective for a Mudi, but they do not respond well to punishment or harsh rebukes. Proper training will keep a Mudi mentally stimulated, happy, and well-behaved.","Mudis are generally healthy, though owners should watch out for certain conditions to which the breed may be genetically predisposed. Some health problems that may affect Mudis include hip or elbow dysplasia, luxating patellas, cataracts, and epilepsy. If you have a Mudi, keep up with regular vet visits and stay vigilant for these conditions.","Mudis have fairly basic care requirements. Their nails should be trimmed every few weeks as needed. Teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Their ears should be checked for signs of infection, parasites, or debris and kept clean. Keep up with regular vet visits to maintain good health.",A Mudi diet should be formulated for a small to mid-sized breed with above-average energy and exercise requirements. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Mudi and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"The Mudi's body coat is medium length and wavy or curly, though the coat on the face and legs is shorter. They can be black, brown, white, fawn, grey, or a marbled mix of black and grey in color. Mudi coats tend to repel and shed most kinds of dirt and debris, and therefore require little grooming. A weekly brushing should be enough for most Mudis, and bathing should only be done as needed. Usually, Mudis love the water, and after a swim or a day at the beach, chances are a quick, freshwater rinse will be all that's necessary to get them clean. Mudi coats rarely need to be cut, if ever. They shed more heavily in the spring and typically don't regrow their full coat until the end of summer.","Mudis can get along well with children and other animals, so long as they are properly socialized, preferably from a young age, and even better if they are raised with children and pets present in the home. Mudis are not, however, very tolerant of teasing or rough treatment, and children should be taught how to interact properly with dogs and supervised at all times when playing with them. Mudis are not overly trusting of strangers, either, so if kids have playmates over, it may be best if the resident Mudi is allowed to maintain a distance until they are used to the presence of a new human in the home. Mudis can be aggressive to other dogs if they are not socialized, but a properly trained Mudi should have no problem with other pets, though they prefer to have lots of personal attention from their humans, so it might be best if they are in a home with only a few other animals at most.","Mudis are quite rare outside of Hungary, but if you are interested in adopting a Mudi, you can try contacting Mudi Club of America, which lists Mudis in need of homes on their website when they find dogs that are available. They may be willing to keep an eye out for you and put you in touch with shelters or rescue organizations that can help you find a Mudi to adopt. You can also check your local shelters, as there's always a chance that they might have the perfect dog for you.",not available
Mutt,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,4,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,Mixed Breed Dogs,,,8 to 15 years,"Your mixed breed, as with all dogs, is an individual. Don't prejudge his temperament according to his looks, or expect him to act a certain way just because he resembles a dog you once had as a kid. Love him on his own terms, and your love will be rewarded.","Size and weight range from tiny enough to sleep inside your jacket with you in it, to humongous enough to break your foot when he steps on it.","Mixed breeds boast personalities as unpredictable and varied as those of their human owners. As with purebreds, the mixed breed's temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and early socialization.Some mutts' heritage is impossible to decipher. If you find one particularly baffling, it may be because he comes from a long line of dogs who were never selectively bred. These mystery dogs are more accurately called non-breeds, than mixed breeds.But a lot of mixed breeds truly are mixed. That is, you can identify a smattering of Australian Cattle Dog, or Beagle, or Collie. This means it's likely some of those breeds' traits are carrying through.Sometimes that can work in your favor. A dog that appears to be a mix of Labrador and Border Collie, for instance, may have the easygoing friendliness of the first and the whip-smart agility of the second.Or not.With any blend, there's no guarantee you'll get the best traits of the contributing breeds. The only guarantee is that whatever you end up with is something unique and inimitable.","Mixed breed dogs are generally considered healthier than purebred dogs because they draw from a broader gene pool. Producing a mixed breed, in other words, is the opposite of inbreeding.But you can't assume your mixed breed will be the healthiest dog you've ever had. Having a fresh bloodline makes little difference if the parents aren't healthy.If you can determine one or more of the breeds that went into your mixed breed's heritage, it's worth researching the health concerns common to that breed or breeds. And like all dogs, mixed breeds are prone to certain conditions and diseases.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a hybrid puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Cancer: Cancer can develop in dogs as well as humans. There are many different types of cancer, and the success of treatment differs for each individual case. For some forms of cancer, the tumors are surgically removed, others are treated with chemotherapy, and some are treated both surgically and medically.Ear Infections: These are most common in dogs with long ears. You may be able to prevent many ear infections by keeping the ears clean and dry. Ask your veterinarian about appropriate ear care products.","Everyone knows that dogs must have adequate food and water, shelter from the elements, and medical attention when needed. His other requirements may be harder to quantify, but they are just as crucial: mental stimulation, physical exercise, and plenty of positive contact with his owner.A leashed walk around the block is usually a sufficient bathroom break, but it isn't enough exercise for most dogs. The majority need 30 to 60 minutes a day to stay in good shape. For some pups, this means off-leash, full-out running to burn off steam; some dogs enjoy a good long walk; others want to go play fetch in a lake. Whatever form of exercise your dog likes the most, he'll be healthier for indulging in it.A dog's mind needs exercise as much as his body does — the same ""use it or lose it"" philosophy applies to us all. Training is a mainstay of canine brain workouts. It could be as simple as playing games with you and learning to sit, or as complex as training for agility or obedience competitions.And whether it's through playing, training, hiking, or petting, your dog needs a substantial daily dose of attention from you.","Keep your mixed breed in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day, rather than leaving food out all the time. How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. As a general rule of thumb, you can estimate how much he needs each day based on how much he weighs:Less than 10 pounds 1/4 to 1/2 cup10 to 15 pounds 1/2 to 1 cup20 to 30 pounds 3/4 to 1.5 cups30 to 40 pounds 1.5 to 2 cups40 to 60 pounds 1.5 to 2.5 cups60 to 70 pounds 2.5 to 3 cups80 to 90 pounds 3 to 4 cups100 to 150 pounds 4 to 5 cupsMore than 150 pounds 4.5 to 6 cupsOf course, dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.It's a good idea to consult with your vet if you're not sure how much to be feeding your mixed-breed dog. And if you're unsure whether your dog is overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs, without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your mixed breed, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Mixed breeds come in all colors of the dog rainbow, and their grooming needs depend on what type of coat they have. Bathing should be done as needed for all breeds.Long, low-shedding coat: This is hair, not fur, and unless you cut it, it continues to grow just like yours. Brush a few times a week with a pin brush, and trim or clip the dog every five to eight weeks or so. Yorkie/Westie mixes tend to have coats of this type.Long, shedding coat: This is fur, because it sheds. Brush weekly, ideally with a pin brush, or more as needed (especially the armpits, which can mat). Golden/Lab/Australian Shepherd mixes tend to sport this kind of coat. (Make sure you have a really, really good vacuum cleaner.)Short coat: Brush weekly in the direction that the fur grows. You can use one of those rubber curry brushes or a hound glove that fits on your hand — then your dog is fooled into thinking he's being petted instead of brushed. Dalmatian/Boxer/Doberman mixes tend to have this kind of coat.Curly coats: Again, this is usually hair, not fur — and it can be relatively high maintenance because of its fine texture. It must be clipped regularly. It's easy to learn to clip a curly coat because the mistakes don't show up much. (Go ahead — it grows back. And that's what dog sweaters are for.) Use a slicker brush. Most Poodle mixes, including the Doodles and Cockapoos, have curly coats.Wire coats: These coats shed. The shorter the coat gets, the more likely it is to mat and knot up, so leaving it longer means less matting. Use a slicker brush. Some wiry coats belonging to Terrier mixes need to stripped.No matter what the heritage of your mixed-breed dog, check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.Brush your dog's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your mixed breed enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Accustom your dog to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy (or as soon as you get him, if he's an adult). Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling down the road.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin and feet or in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Some mixed breeds are great with kids and other pets, and some aren't. Much of any dog's relationship with children and animals depends on early exposure and socialization.Heredity is also part of the picture. If the mix is predominantly terrier, don't bother trying to get him to live peaceably with small mammals such as rats and gerbils.But even if your dog is a Golden Retriever mix, that doesn't mean he'll automatically love everyone and every other dog. And just because your dog is a mix of big, intimidating breeds doesn't mean he's going to eat the neighborhood children. It also doesn't mean he's going to be okay around them.Who knows? Keep a watchful eye and a tight rein (not to mention a short leash) until you know for sure.","Dogs are often obtained without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. Many dogs are in need of adoption and or fostering. If you want a mix involving a certain breed, contact the local chapter of that breed club, and they'll be able to point you toward a rescue organization.Many times a purebred group such as an Irish Setter rescue will also take in Irish Setter mixes, if the dogs appear to be predominantly and identifiably Irish.",not available

They are calm indoors however and can do fine in an apartment or condo big enough to accommodate their sprawl.Neos are generally clumsy dogs who have trouble navigating more than a few stairs, especially as puppies.The Neapolitan Mastiff is an average shedder and requires weekly brushing, plus close attention to cleaning his skin wrinkles and folds.He's an excellent deterrent to intruders, but rarely aggressive without cause. Socialize him early and often so that he learns how to behave around other people and animals.Neapolitan Mastiffs can be lazy and will become obese if he doesn't get much exercise. Make sure your dog maintains a healthy weight to avoid diseases that can significantly reduce his life span.The Neapolitan Mastiff is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving. The Neo is strong-willed and will test whether you really mean what you say.Neapolitan Mastiffs have a fearsome appearance and a deep bark, both of which are usually more than enough to deter even the most foolhardy criminals.Neapolitan Mastiffs have a number of what some consider offensive habits: slobbering, drooling, wheezing, grunting, snorting, and flatulence.This affectionate dog is not aware of his size and will happily cuddle up to you or on you. [Note: We know of a Neo whose family puts up the Christmas tree at Halloween and doesn't take it down until February because he loves to lie around the tree, and they get the sofa to themselves for a few months.]Neapolitan Mastiffs love the outdoors, but they also love being with their family. They should live indoors with their people, not alone in the backyard.Young Neapolitan Mastiffs are rowdy, but it's important for their orthopedic development to prevent a lot of jumping or stair climbing until they reach physical maturity.Neapolitan Mastiffs can be destructive if bored. Give them regular exercise, social interaction, and training to keep life interesting.Neapolitan Mastiffs are good with older children, but can be too large for a toddler. They can knock over or step on small children without meaning to hurt them.Never buy a Neapolitan Mastiff from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.",Male Neapolitan Mastiffs stand 26 to 31 inches at the shoulder and weigh 150 to 200 pounds. Females are 24 to 29 inches tall and weigh 120 to 175 pounds.,"Steady and solid as an oak tree, the Neo is a guardian rather than an attack dog. He's always alert and aware, even if it looks like he's relaxing.If you aren't home, they simply won't let anyone onto your property. And really, who's going to argue with them?When you welcome someone, though, your Neo will accept that person as well, although he'll probably remain aloof. This isn't a ""hail fellow, well met"" kind of dog.The Neo is affectionate toward his family, but he's also strong-willed — and big enough to have his own way. Begin training early, be firm and consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques, such as praise and food rewards.As with every dog, Neapolitan Mastiffs need early socialization or exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Neo puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Neapolitan Mastiffs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Neos will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain.Cardiomyopathy: This heart condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time.Cherry Eye: This condition occurs when the gland located in the dog's third eyelid (known as the nictitating membrane) bulges out. It looks like a reddened mass at the inner corner of the eye. Cherry eye can be repaired surgically.Cleft Palate: The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the nasal and oral cavities. It is made up of two parts, hard and soft. A cleft palate has a slit that runs bilaterally or unilaterally and can range in size from a small hole to a large slit. A cleft palate can affect both the hard and soft palate separately and together and may cause a cleft lip. Puppies can be born with cleft palates, or a cleft palate can occur from an injury. Cleft palates are fairly common in dogs, but many puppies born with a cleft palate do not survive or are euthanized by the breeder. The only treatment for a cleft palate is surgery to close the hole, although not all dogs with a cleft palate require the surgery. It is important to get a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from your veterinarian.Demodicosis: All dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother dog passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can't be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother passes mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause any problems. If your Neo has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, he can develop demodectic mange.Demodectic mange, also called demodicosis, can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It's thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. Even so, you should take your dog to the vet because it can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link.Fold Dermatitis: A skin infection caused by moisture trapped in the folds of the skin. The signs of fold dermatitis are redness, sores, and odor. The dog can be affected on the tail, face, lips, vulvar folds, or any other wrinkled area. Mild cases of fold dermatitis are usually treated with topical ointments or antibiotics, but severe cases may require surgical removal of the folds or amputation of the tail in the case of fold dermatitis on the tail. Keep your Neo's wrinkles clean and dry to prevent this problem.Find a good breeder: If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Neos, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, and heart, as well as certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","The Neo is best suited to a home with a fenced yard. Although he's a homebody and not prone to wandering, a fence will help him to know the limits of his property, an important bit of knowledge for a guard dog.It's critical to understand your Neo puppy's physical limitations; exercise him in a controlled manner so his bones and joints don't undergo too much stress during the formative period.This means short periods of free running and play and short walks on leash only. Stairs are another hazard for the Neo puppy. He's clumsy and can easily fall and hurt himself. Carry him up and down the stairs for as long as possible, and try to restrain him from running on them.Avoid roughhousing or wrestling. You never want your adult Neo to think it's okay to play rough with you. It might have been cute when he was a puppy, but it can be dangerous once he's full-grown.Neapolitan Mastiffs don't make great jogging companions and are usually happiest when curled up on the couch. An adult Neo will benefit from a couple of short to moderate daily walks, however. He's sensitive to heat and humidity, so schedule walks for cool mornings and evenings, and be sure he always has a cool place to rest and plenty of fresh water.If you have a pool or spa, restrict your Neo's access to it unless you're there to supervise. This is a top-heavy dog who doesn't swim well and has difficulty keeping his head above water.Start training your Neo as soon as you bring him home, while he's still at a manageable size. Enroll in a puppy socialization class to accustom him to being around other dogs and people. This is extremely important for the Neapolitan Mastiff, who can be aggressive toward other dogs and people if he isn't taught manners.In addition to puppy kindergarten and regular obedience class, take your Neo to parks, outdoor shopping malls, and other places where he can learn to meet people and become accustomed to new experiences, sights, and sounds.The Neo is headstrong and needs a confident trainer. Use positive reinforcement techniques, never physical punishment, but be firm and consistent in what you ask of him.Think beyond puppyhood. If you don't want your Neo on the furniture when he weighs 200 pounds, don't let him on it when he only weighs 20 pounds. Once a habit is established, it will be difficult to break.Housetraining shouldn't be a problem as long as you make it a positive experience and provide your pup with a regular potty schedule and plenty of opportunities to go outside. Crate training is a wonderful tool for housetraining and keeping your young puppy from chewing things he shouldn't.The Neapolitan Mastiff needs a firm hand when training, but he also needs love and patience. When he's trained, you'll find that he's a wonderful, caring, and loyal companion who will gladly risk his life to defend yours.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 6 or more cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Cleaning and keep the wrinkles dry is an important part of grooming this breed.The body skin is thick and abundant. The short, dense coat is the same length and smoothness all over the body, with straight hairs that are no longer than one inch.The Neo has a coat that comes in solid gray, black, mahogany, and tawny or in tan brindle, in which the dog appears dark with tan stripes. A Neo with a white spot on the head is disqualified from the show ring, but it doesn't affect his ability to be a companion or guardian.The Neo sheds about as much as the average dog. Weekly brushing with a bristle brush or hound glove will keep his coat clean and free of loose or dead hair. Check the wrinkles to see if they need cleaning. Wipe them out with a damp cloth and then dry the skin inside the folds thoroughly. Bathe him as needed, and prepare to get wet when you do.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Neo's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Neo jumps up to greet you.Introduce your Neo to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult, essential when you're dealing with a dog this size.","The Neo is suitable for families with older children, but he can be too big and clumsy to spend much time around toddlers. While he'll never intentionally hurt them, he can easily knock them over or step on them.Make it a rule that children are never to run and scream in a Neo's presence. The noise and activity can excite him, and he's simply too big to be allowed to chase children or play roughly with them.He may also feel the need to protect ""his"" children from other kids, especially if they're wrestling or otherwise appear to be fighting. Always supervise play so that he knows you're in charge.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child to never approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Neo is not fond of dogs he doesn't know, although he can learn to get along with those he's raised with. He can also get along with cats if he's raised with them.","If you're interested in adopting an adult Neapolitan Mastiff who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.United States Neapolitan Mastiff Rescue",not available

Ongoing training and dog sports are a perfect outlet for his working abilities.If you can't stand dog slobber, the Newfoundland is not for you. This breed drools. A lot.To keep the Newfoundland's thick coat looking great, he needs regular grooming. You can do it yourself, which is time consuming, or you can hire a professional groomer, which can be expensive.The Newfoundland thrives in cool climates, though he can adapt to living in warmer climates. To protect him from heat stroke, keep him near air conditioning or fans when it's really hot.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.

Socialization helps ensure that your Newfoundland puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Newfoundlands are prone to certain health conditions. Not all Newfoundlands will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Newfoundlands, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Addison's Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this extremely serious condition is caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison's disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and lethargy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it's easy to miss this disease as a diagnosis until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison's is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.Cataracts: As in humans, canine cataracts are characterized by cloudy spots on the eye lens that can grow over time. They may develop at any age, and often don't impair vision, although some cases cause severe vision loss. Breeding dogs should be examined by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist to be certified as free of hereditary eye disease before they're bred. Cataracts can usually be surgically removed with good results.Cherry eye: Cherry eye occurs when the gland known as the third eyelid swells. It looks like a red mass — a cherry — at the inner corner of the dog's eye. The treatment for cherry eye is usually surgery, either attaching the gland in place with stitches or removing the tissue, which results in a tightening that pushes the gland back in place once it has healed.Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis: This heart problem is caused by a narrow connection between the left ventricle (out-flow) and the aorta. It can cause fainting and even sudden death. Your vet can detect it and prescribe the proper treatment.Epilepsy: Epilepsy is often inherited and can cause mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem or medication to control the pain.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland that's thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It's treated with medication and diet.Cystinuria: Cystinuria is an inherited disorder caused by an inability to reabsorb cystine, which is an amino acid, in the kidneys. This results in kidney or bladder stones that cause blockage and urinary tract inflammation. If left untreated, it can lead to death. Treatment includes medication that prevents the formation of stones. Genetic testing is available.Cancer: Symptoms that may indicate canine cancer include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.Gastric Torsion: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Newfoundlands, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, or drink large amounts of water or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these symptoms, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Ruptured Anterior Cruciate Ligament: This is a common knee injury and tends to occur in young, large dogs during play or older overweight dogs; the anterior cruciate ligament tears or ruptures resulting in a sudden lameness. Treatment varies according to severity, but includes rest, limited activity, medication, and surgery.","Though relatively mellow, this dog needs regular activity. He's no long-distance runner, but he's a great swimmer.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Newfoundland puppy. Like other giant breeds, the Newfoundland grows very rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making him susceptible to bone disorders. As a big dog, he ages more quickly than small dogs too.Don't let your Newfoundland puppy run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement or pull a cart until he's at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, as is puppy agility, with its one-inch jumps. Swimming is an ideal form of exercise for a Newfoundland puppy because he works his muscles without the danger of injuring his joints.Training should begin the day you bring your Newfoundland puppy home. He is generally eager to please so training is fairly easy. Leash training is a must with the Newfoundland, especially because he's going to weigh more than 100 pounds when he's full grown. Puppy kindergarten and obedience classes are recommended.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Newfoundland puppies need slow, steady growth. Feed a good-quality diet with 22 to 24 percent protein, and 12 to 15 percent fat. Keep your Newfoundland in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Newfoundland in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Newfoundland, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Newfoundland has a flat, water-resistant double coat. The outer coat is coarse and long, and the undercoat is soft and dense. Shedding is moderate, and the bulk of it occurs primarily in the spring and fall.The Newfoundland coat comes in several colors, including solid black, brown, gray, or Landseer, a white coat with black markings.His thick, handsome coat requires brushing two to three times a week. Bathe as needed, every one to two months.Many owners opt to hire a professional groomer to groom their Newfoundland because it's a daunting task. Regardless, you still need to brush regularly. Like all dogs with a fluffy coat, the Newfoundland gets dirty easily. Expect muddy paws, leaves or burrs stuck in the coat, and feces on the hindquarters.Brush your Newfoundland's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once every month or so if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding. If you're not uncomfortable doing it yourself, ask a vet or groomer to do it for you.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Newfoundland to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","This cuddly giant is highly tolerant of children, which is important because he's a kid magnet thanks to his size and wealth of soft fur. But he can also accidentally knock over a toddler or small child, and can appear intimidating to children who don't know him.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Newfoundland is also easygoing and friendly with other pets, including cats and small mammals, as long as he is properly socialized and trained.","Newfoundlands are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Newfoundlands in need of adoption and or fostering. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Newfoundland rescue.Newfoundland Club of America Rescue Network","Newfoundland Club of America, Inc."

Crate training is highly recommended.Norfolks are energetic dogs who like a lot of activity so make sure he's included in the household action as much as possible.Do not allow a Norfolk off leash in unsecured areas because you never know when his instinct to chase will kick in.The Norfolk is not yappy, but he will bark if he thinks something is amiss or if he's bored.The Norfolk is passionate about digging. Fencing should be sunk one foot deep and checked regularly for escape holes.Some Norfolk Terriers become obese if fed too much and exercised too little. Do not indulge his desire for more food.Don't expect to call a Norfolk breeder Tuesday and buy a puppy on Thursday. You may have to wait as long as a year for one.","Males and females are 9 to 10 inches tall, and weigh 11 to 12 pounds","The Norfolk has personality plus. Though small, he makes up for it with a buoyant, lively approach to life. He is active, alert, good natured, and always ready to play.The Norfolk is tireless in his pursuit of fun--which can be exhausting for you. Don't expect the Norfolk to sit around when there's something to investigate. This dog thrives on action so be prepared to provide it for him--or he'll be bored and unhappy.The Norfolk is a typical terrier, meaning he's independent and always ready to give chase. He's prone to dig and bark, too--behaviors that come naturally to breeds bred to chase vermin that live in dens.These traits can be frustrating to owners who are either unprepared for the terrier personality, or just don't enjoy it. If you're okay with terriers, you'll be delighted with the Norfolk's lively, plucky attitude, and his devotion to family.","The Norfolk is generally a hearty dog. Like all breeds, though, the Norfolk is prone to some conditions.Mitral valve disease (MVD). MVD is a life-threatening heart abnormality that reputable Norfolk breeders are working to reduce or completely eradicate in the breed. Research is underway, but it may take many years for it to be completed. Meanwhile, dogs with MVD should not be bred, and all breeding dogs should be tested for the condition.Canine hip dysplasia. Hip dyplasia is a heritable condition in which the femur doesn't fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop.X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems.Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Vaccination sensitivity. There are reports of Norfolks suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, symptoms include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. Sometimes a dog who is sensitive to vaccines will develop complications, or die. Watch your Norfolk carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual.","The Norfolk is an easy-care dog. Because of his small size, he's well-suited to apartment living--though he can get barky if bored.He needs at least one 20 to 30 minute vigorous walk or play session, or two 10 to 15 minute sessions every day.This dog is intelligent and enjoys learning. But his natural independence and occasional stubborness can make training challenging at times. Consistent, positive training is the best way to convince him to do what you ask.Teaching the Norfolk to come reliably when called is especially important in case he accidentally comes unleashed. Don't ever yell or use physical force with these dogs--they're highly sensitive and may become fearful or agitated as a result.Like many terriers, the Norfolk barks. While he's not overly noisy, a ""Quiet"" command should become part of his basic canine repertoire.One word of caution: the Norfolk, like many other earth dogs, enjoys, no, loves, digging and this trait is not as easy to deter as barking.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food.

Not surprisingly, he's prone to obesity. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard.

The coat is weather-resistant, and sheds minimally. The Norfolk coat comes in shades of red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle.The fur around the neck and shoulders is longer, and forms a ruff at the base of the ears and throat. The hair on the ears and head is short and smooth, except for eyebrows and whiskers.The shaggy, unkempt look of the Norfolk is part of his appeal. He does require some grooming, though.His coat should be brushed one or twice a week, toenails trimmed regularly, and ears cleaned or checked weekly.Frequent tooth brushing with a soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste help prevent gum disease. Monthly bathing is needed. More than that may soften the coarse terrier coat.The Norfolk coat is not usually trimmed with clippers like other breeds, but shortened or shaped by stripping, a process by which coat is thinned and shortened with a stripping knife, a sharp, comb-like tool. Stripping is common practice for owners with show dogs, but not necessary for a family pet.","The Norfolk is good with children, and makes a good family pet. He is best suited to families with children age 10 and older because they're less likely to accidentally step on or hurt him, due to his small size.Because the good-natured Norfolk is less apt to quarrel with other dogs than some terriers, he lives happily in a household with other dogs. He is not well suited, however, for a home with small animals. Unable to curb his natural instinct, he'll chase hamsters, gerbils, birds, and any other animal he perceives as prey.",Norwich and Norfolk Terriers Club of America ,"Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Norfolk Terrier.Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club"

However, he can be aggressive to other dogs and animals, so it's important to properly socialize your Elkhound from puppyhood to a variety of new experiences and dogs.The Elkhound can be dominant and difficult to train, but training can nonetheless be enjoyable and effective as long as the approach is consistent and firm.Being a working breed, the Elkhound has a level of intelligence, independence, and energy that can be overwhelming for timid or inconsistent owners. You should expect him to need at least 30 minutes of exercise twice per day, which will also fight this food-motivated dog's tendency toward obesity. He'll also need some form of mental stimulation to keep him from becoming bored.The Norwegian Elkhound does fine in apartments if he's properly exercised, but the ideal setting is a large, fenced yard. Despite his outdoor hardiness, he needs to live indoors with his family.He can be a barker, which you should keep in mind before bringing one home. Although some Elkhounds can be trained to not bark, this is not the norm.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The Norwegian Elkhound is a medium-sized dog, averaging 20.5 inches in height. Males average 55 pounds; females 48 pounds.","Independent thinkers, these extroverted clowns like to be where the action is. They see themselves as coexisting with you — not necessarily underneath you in the chain of command.They can be hard to train because of that independence, but they can get it if you're firm and consistent. If you're not a firm person, however, this dog will walk all over you. And while consistency is critical, harsh training methods don't work well.Amazingly devoted, he's protective if not outright possessive of his family. Attached and loyal, he's happiest to be with you all the time and dotes on your attention and interaction. A born watchdog but not aggressive by nature, his bark provides a level of safety from intruders.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Elkhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Elkhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Elkhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Elkhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Elkhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Fanconi Syndrome: This is a serious, inherited disease that affects the kidneys and the tubules that reabsorb substances. This leads to improper levels of calcium, glucose, phosphate, sodium and amino acids. Symptoms, which usually begin with excessive urination and thirst, can occur between the ages of one to seven years. As the disease progresses and the kidneys begin to fail, symptoms include weight loss, muscle wasting, muscle pain, lethargy, loss of appetite, and vomiting. Untreated, the disease is fatal. If caught early and treated with appropriate management, affected dogs can do well. Management includes medication, change in diet, and a constant supply of fresh water.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It's treated with medication and diet.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Sebaceous Cysts: These are follicular cysts that form under the dog's skin. They can range in size from small to as large as a walnut, and they will occasionally burst open, expelling a thick, white cheesy mass. Surgical removal is the usual treatment.","The Norwegian Elkhound requires daily exercise (breeders recommend 30 minutes twice a day), not only to burn off energy but also to help him maintain a healthy weight. Exceptionally food-motivated, he can become obese (look out for those huge, soulful brown eyes aimed at your dinner), and proper feeding and exercise are required throughout his life.He does all right in apartments, but he is a barker, so take that into consideration. A home with a fenced yard is more suitable. He could live outside because he's so hardy, but he'd much rather be indoors with you.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Elkhound doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Elkhound accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Elkhound in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night (if that's where he sleeps — he's going to prefer to be in your bed with you). Elkhounds are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Remember that Elkhounds are highly motivated by food and can turn into accomplished beggars. So if you can't resist sneaking him scraps from the table, and if you can't provide the high level of exercise he requires, you could find yourself with an obese dog.Keep your Elkhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist.

The topcoat is short and thick and lies smooth. The undercoat is dense, woolly and soft to the touch.The Elkhound is usually medium gray with black-tipped guard hairs accented by a lot of light silver. Typically there's a darker gray coloring on the saddle, and black tipping on the ears and tail. His chest and mane are a lighter gray. The Elkhound is shown in conformation in a natural state, without any trimming.Most of the year he doesn't shed too much, but two or three times a year he ""blows coat"" and sheds like crazy. He requires weekly brushing, possibly more when shedding; but his coat is fairly easy to maintain. If you like a fastidiously clean house, however, another breed would be a better choice.The Norwegian Elkhound tends to be a clean breed in terms of his coat, which naturally expels debris (usually onto your couch or clothing). He generally doesn't smell too doggish and requires baths only when absolutely necessary. When you do bathe him, it's important to use a high-quality dog shampoo.Brush your Elkhound's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Elkhound to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","An Elkhound is excellent with children and will play with and protect them. However, without careful obedience training, they may take over the role of pack leader and become dominant, especially toward children, less strong-willed adults, or other dogs.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Norwegian Elkhound generally gets along with other pets, including cats, but remember his prey drive and willingness to hunt big game.","Elkhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They make excellent walking companions.Norwich Terriers must have a fenced yard because they will chase any animal they deem as ""prey."" Underground electronic fencing is not adequate for Norwich Terriers because they tend to ignore the shock.Norwich Terriers can be difficult to housetrain and although they're eager to please, training can be difficult when not properly motivated. Be patient, stick to a regular schedule, reward them with praise and treats when they potty outdoors, and crate them when you can't supervise them indoors.Norwich Terriers can coexist with other dogs and cats, but the breed will generally classify any rabbits, gerbils, or other small rodents as prey. They are not a good match for homes where small pets are allowed to roam free.Barking is often an indicator that your Norwich Terrier sees something suspicious, is bored, or hasn't had his exercise needs met. The breed is not known for being overly yappy but there are exceptions to every rule and every Norwich Terrier will bark if the above occurs.Norwich Terriers can live in apartments if they're given plenty of exercise (of course this can be said of most dogs).The Norwich Terrier, like many terriers, enjoys digging. Bear in mind it's easier to train a dog to dig in a specific area then it is to break him of his digging habit.The Norwich is a rare and therefore expensive breed.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.

They are small, but that doesn't mean you should overindulge or coddle them. That simply leads to behavior problems.The Norwich is active and loves playing with balls and toys or just playing a good game with the people he loves. He thrives on the companionship of humans and will fit himself into your life completely.Like every dog, Norwich Terriers need early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your Norwich Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start.Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Norwich Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Norwich Terriers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Tracheal Collapse: Tracheal collapse is often seen in small breed such as the Norwich. It is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings, which flatten until finally obstructing the airway. Signs of tracheal collapse include coughing that sounds like a goose honk, fainting, and an inability to exercise for long periods. It is treated medically with antibiotics, steroids, and cough suppressants. You may be advised to walk your dog with a harness rather than a collar to reduce pressure on his neck. If medical treatment doesn't work, surgery is recommended.Elongated Soft Palate: The soft palate is the extension of the roof of the mouth. When the soft palate is elongated, it can obstruct the airway and cause difficulty in breathing. The treatment for Elongated Soft Palate is surgical removal of the excess palate.Epilepsy: The Norwich Terrier can suffer from epilepsy, which is a disorder that causes seizures in the dog. Epilepsy can be treated by medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this hereditary disorder.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Norwich Terriers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","The Norwich Terrier is an intelligent working dog. He's happiest when he has a job to do. Training can be fairly easy with this breed as long you provide clear and consistent rules and training. Making a training session interesting rather than repetitive is another way to keep the Norwich Terrier engaged and interested in learning.Housetraining can be a challenge and may take a significant amount of time and patience. Use a crate to prevent accidents in the home.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Norwich doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap.Never stick your Norwich in a crate all day long, however. Norwich Terriers are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.Norwich Terriers require daily exercise and like many terrier breeds they have an ample supply of energy. They make wonderful walking companions, and their exercise requirements can be met with a couple of vigorous 10- or 15-minute walks per day or playtime in a fenced area.It's important that a Norwich Terrier remain on lead when he's not in a fenced area or his strong desire to chase can cause him to run right in front of a car.Although the Norwich Terrier is known to bark, he can live in an apartment if his stimulation and exercise needs are met.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.It's been said that the Norwich will eat anything that doesn't eat him first. Not surprisingly, he's prone to obesity. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Norwich, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Norwich Terrier wears a hard, wiry, straight topcoat over a soft, downy, insulating undercoat. The hair on his neck and shoulders forms a protective mane. Small dark eyes twinkle beneath slight eyebrows. The hair on the rest of his head, including the ears and muzzle, is short.The Norwich coat can be any shade of red, grizzle (a mixture of black or red hairs with white hairs), wheaten (pale yellow or fawn), or black and tan.Like all breeds, Norwich Terriers shed, though not as much as some. Brush them weekly to remove dead hair. Regular brushing will keep your Norwich clean. He won't need frequent baths unless he rolls in something stinky.Stripping the coat twice a year--pulling out the dead topcoat by hand or with the aid of a stripping tool--maintains the coat's characteristic hard texture. Without stripping, your Norwich will look a little scruffy, and he'll shed more than he would otherwise.If you clip your Norwich's coat instead of stripping it, the color and texture changes, becoming lighter and softer and more prone to shedding.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Norwich's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Small breeds such as the Norwich are especially prone to severe gingivitis.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Norwich enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin getting your Norwich accustomed to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Norwich Terriers are known for their love of everyone, and this includes children. They do much better in homes with children if they are raised with them. An adult Norwich who's unfamiliar with children may do best in a home with children who are mature enough to interact with him properly.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Norwich Terriers also do very well with other dogs and tend to have no issues with other canine pets. They can adjust to living with cats but they need to be properly socialized to them to do so.",Norwich Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption and fostering.Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club ,"Below are breed clubs, organizations, and associations where you can find additional information about the Norwich Terrier.Norwich and Norfolk Terrier Club"

His red coat and flesh-colored nose mean the Toller may have a higher incidence of immune-mediated disease.Although he has a medium length coat, the Toller's coat is fairly low maintenance and easy to care for.Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are moderately active sporting dogs and need roughly an hour a day of exercise. If not properly exercised, they will expend their energy in less positive ways, such as chewing and digging.Tollers have a strong prey drive that will prompt them to chase cats or other small animals they see outdoors. Keep your Toller in a fenced yard to prevent him from running after prey.If you live in an apartment, or noise controlled neighborhood, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever may not be the dog for you. When he's excited, he's likely to emit a scream that's loud, high-pitched, and nerve wracking.If you prefer a clean and tidy dog, the Toller may not be the breed for you. He sheds seasonally and enjoys rolling and frolicking in mud and dirt.The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is not a miniature Golden Retriever; their temperaments are quite different.The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a rare breed and it may take time to locate a reputable breeder who has puppies available. Expect a wait of six months to a year or more for a puppy. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Males stand 18 to 21 inches tall at the shoulder with an ideal height of 19 inches. Females are 17 to 20 inches, with the ideal height being 18 inches. Weight is in proportion to height and generally ranges from 35 to 50 pounds.","Tollers are smart, independent, and curious. Their personality lies somewhere between that of a Golden Retriever and a terrier. It's not unusual for them to have a sense of humor, and they generally have an outgoing, upbeat attitude.When not working or playing, they're content to lie down and be quiet. Adults are typically gentle dogs, particularly with children.Tollers are adaptable, moving from one environment to another with ease, and tolerant of crate training and travel. They can be standoffish toward strangers, but they take their cues from their people. If you're friendly toward someone, your Toller will be, too.Tollers watch everything that's going on and will alert you if someone is approaching your home. They usually get along well with other animals, although aggression is occasionally a problem. That's not typical for the breed, however.As with every dog, Tollers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Establish yourself as the benevolent leader, rather than the harsh dictator, and your Toller should take well to training.","Tollers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Tollers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Collie Eye Anomaly: Although Collie eye is usually seen in Collie breeds, it has been seen in the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever in the last several years. Collie Eye Anomaly is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and is diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. There is no treatment for CEA, but blind dogs can get around very well using their other senses. It is important to remember that this condition is a genetic abnormality, and your breeder should be notified if your puppy has the condition. It is also important to spay or neuter your dog to prevent the gene from being passed to a new generation of puppies.Deafness: A few lines of Tollers appear to be prone to deafness. It tends to develop late in life, between 7 and 8 years of age.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Tollers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal.

He can, however, live happily in a city highrise as long as he gets a couple of daily walks. There are Tollers in the country and Tollers who live in apartments and are paper-trained to potty on the balcony.Toller puppies are born yipping and running around, or at least it seems that way. During their first year, they're highly active, but eventually their activity level tapers to a more manageable level.Like any dog, Tollers can be destructive as puppies if not properly supervised. Crate training is recommended. Adults can be destructive as well if they don't get the exercise they need.A tired Toller is a good Toller. Expect to give him at least an hour of exercise per day. He'll enjoy a couple of 30-minute walks or runs, a 30-minute walk and 30 minutes of playing fetch, a hike of an hour or two, or any other combination of exercise the two of you can do together. And this dog likes to swim.To keep his feet in good condition, walk your Toller on rough ground once in a while. This helps keep the foot pads tight so they don't pick up a lot of debris that could damage the foot.To protect puppies as they grow, monitor their activity and don't let them overdo things. A good rule of thumb is 5 minutes for every month of age, so limit a 6-month-old puppy to 30 minutes of play or other exercise throughout the day.When it comes to training, be firm but gentle with your Toller, as well as creative, patient, and flexible. You must be able to earn his trust and respect without using anger, intimidation, or physical force. With this breed, harshness begets stubbornness, and you don't want to get into a battle of wills with a Toller. You'll lose. Set firm rules, enforce them consistently, and don't let your Toller get bored.Train him with a light touch, however. He doesn't perform well under pressure. But when he's motivated by praise, play, and food rewards, the Toller learns quickly and easily.He shouldn't be difficult to housetrain, given a consistent schedule, no opportunities to have accidents in the house, and positive reinforcement when he potties outdoors.","Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food.

If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Toller, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Toller has a medium-length, water-repellent double coat. The red or orange color gives him a foxlike appearance, even giving rise to the tale that he's the result of a fox-retriever cross, a genetic impossibility.He may have white markings on his feet, chest, face, or tail tip. A white tail tip is especially desirable because it allows the hunter to keep the dog in sight from a distance. The tail itself should be full and bushy, never trimmed and sculpted. Nose, lips, and eye rims are black or flesh-colored, blending with the coat.This is a wash-and-go dog. Throughout most of the year, the coat requires only weekly brushing to keep the fur from matting and to remove dead hair. During the spring and fall shedding seasons, daily brushing may be necessary.Otherwise, simply keep the nails trimmed, clean and trim the foot pads, and pluck around the ears if they're particularly hairy. Bathe as needed.At some point during puppyhood, usually at three to four months of age, your Toller's ears may go wonky, folding back instead of framing the face. The ears may need to be taped to regain the correct position. Your Toller's breeder can show you how.Brush your Toller's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it.

They may be too rambunctious for very young children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away.

They are large, bouncy and enthusiastic, but when they are young they can be especially rowdy. Patient, consistent training is must.Old English Sheepdogs are not for clean freaks. They tend to drool and are heavy shedders. Also, their heavy coats trap debris and dirt, which ends up on your furniture and floor.Originally bred for driving cattle and sheep, the OES is an active breed that requires a lot of exercise.The Old English Sheepdog coat is high maintenance. Keeping it clean and tangle-free is time-consuming and expensive.Separation anxiety is common in Old English Sheepdogs. They live for their families, and they can become destructive if they're left alone too much.To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.",Males stand 22 inches tall and weigh 80 to 100 pounds. Females stand 21 inches tall and weigh 60 to 85 pounds.,"The Old English Sheepdog is a playful, affectionate clown who delights in frolicking with his family and neighborhood children. In fact, adolescence in the OES often extends to about age three, and an adult OES will retain his playful demeanor well into his golden years.An intelligent breed, the OES is a quick learner, always looking for something interesting and fun to do. He's capable of performing numerous tasks, including herding, agility, obedience, and search and rescue.This breed requires significant physical and mental exercise. He doesn't enjoy being left alone for long periods of time and much prefers — in fact needs — to be in the company of his family.A properly bred OES is good-natured and kind, and this is what makes him an excellent children's companion and a super family dog. He's sometimes called a nanny, a term of endearment that arises from stories surrounding the role he sometimes takes on within his family.However, the OES is not known for being an assertive watchdog. He may bark when strangers come to his home — or he may not. Some OESs are highly protective, while others aren't.","Old English Sheepdogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Old English Sheepdogs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Canine hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, however, arthritis can develop. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Cataracts cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Hypothyroidism is caused by deficiencies of the hormone produced from the thyroid gland. A mild symptom of the disease may be infertility. More apparent signs are obesity, mental dullness, lethargy, and irregular heat cycles. The fur becomes coarse and brittle and falls out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism is treated with a daily thyroid replacement and usually requires lifelong treatment.Deafness is fairly common and can provide many challenges for both the dog and the owner. Some forms of deafness and hearing loss can be treated with medication and surgery, but usually deafness cannot be cured. Patience and time must be given to a deaf dog and there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you and the dog. If your dog is diagnosed with hearing loss or total deafness, take the time to evaluate if you have the patience, time, and ability to care for him properly.","Because of his working origins, the OES likes activity. Today's Old English Sheepdogs are very capable participants in sheepherding and agility trials, both of which demand a healthy and physically fit dog. Figure on one to two hours of daily exercise as part of the OES routine.Of course, your dog's needs will vary according to age. Pups have a lot of energy — so much so that they will use it to destroy your home if they aren't kept busy with approved activities. On the other hand, older dogs may prefer to lie on the couch (taking up all of it) and need encouragement to exercise. It's important to note that while the OES can readily adjust to less exercise, this isn't particularly healthy for him.However, cut back on outdoor exercise when the weather is hot. The dense undercoat of the OES is extremely warm, and the dog can overheat quickly and easily.Obedience training is encouraged for all dogs, but especially for a large breed like the OES. The basic commands (""sit,"" ""down,"" ""come,"" and ""stay"") are important for everyday living with any dog, but add a wet and muddy OES coat in the mix, and you'll realize that these commands are crucial. Luckily, the OES is very intelligent and learns quickly.The OES does not always take confinement well, so if you crate train your OES puppy, must make sure that you do not leave him in the crate too long. He should be out with you when you are home; the OES is sensitive to being shut off from the family he loves.During his first year, the OES grows from 1 pound to 60. When fully grown, he may weigh as much as 100 pounds. Due to this rapid growth, especially between the ages of four and seven months, they are susceptible to bone disorders. Take care to feed your OES puppy a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps him from growing too fast.Additionally, he shouldn't run and play on very hard surfaces such as pavement; normal play on grass is fine. Forced jumping or jogging on hard surfaces should be avoided until the dog is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed (puppy agility classes, with their one-inch jumps, are fine).","Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Overfeeding an OES is especially easy to do because the fluffy coat readily hides extra pounds. It is extremely important that you check your dog's weight regularly and take care not to overfeed him.For more on feeding your Old English Sheepdog, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","If you want a dog with big hair, the Old English Sheepdog is the one for you. This breed has hair galore: a profuse, shaggy coat that is neither straight nor curly. The breed has a double coat, with a textured outer coat and soft undercoat. Colors include gray, grizzle, blue or blue merle, brown, and fawn, usually mixed with white markings.If you want a grooming challenge, try the OES. His coat is difficult to maintain; you will spend a minimum of three to four hours a week grooming him. If you're new to the world of dogs, you'll need help learning how to brush and comb your OES. The breeder can be helpful, and there are many quality grooming books and (better yet) videos on the market aimed at helping pet owners with this task.The OES is a heavy shedder and requires daily brushing to remove dead hair and keep the coat free of tangles.Some Old English Sheepdogs drool so much that the coat around their mouths turns yellow. If this happens, a regular washing, especially after meals, will help. Another method is to apply cornstarch to the beard. Once the cornstarch has completely dried, brush it out. This also works well when an OES has diarrhea.As with all breeds, it is important to begin grooming the OES puppy at an early age. Making grooming a positive and soothing experience will ensure easier handling, both for you and for professional groomers, as your OES puppy grows into adulthood.You'll need to invest in a few tools to brush and comb your OES: a pin brush, coarse steel comb, and a slicker brush. Brushing should be a gentle process to avoid pulling and hurting the dog. It is important to always brush all the way to the skin, not just the top layer of coat, to remove any debris or hair that's trapped in the undercoat. One tip for brushing is to spray the dog lightly with a detangler and/or conditioner before you brush.Mats are a real danger for the OES, and they can lead to skin problems. They're extremely difficult to remove and, in severe cases of matting, the dog will need to be shaved.Besides brushing and combing out the coat, the OES needs bathing every six to eight weeks. The nails need to be trimmed once a month, and the ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Then wipe the ears out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner. Regular toothbrushing with a soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste will help prevent dental disease.Many owners opt to have a professional groomer keep the OES coat in good condition (in addition to the regular brushing they perform themselves). This is expensive, and you must consider the cost when you think about buying an OES.","The well-bred and well-socialized Old English Sheepdog is a trustworthy children's companion. Some say he will supervise and herd young children, keeping them in a particular area. Others say the OES acts as a means of support to the toddler learning to walk.Unfortunately, there are some exceptions to the Old English Sheepdog's role as a loving nanny, due to poor breeding that has resulted in ill-tempered and neurotic dogs. Buy only from a reputable breeder and ask to meet the puppy's parents. And it is extremely important to note that children should never be left unsupervised with any dog, regardless of breed or temperament.The good-natured OES is friendly with other dogs and pets, provided he is properly socialized and trained.","Old English Sheepdogs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Old English Sheepdogs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

A vigorous daily workout of jogging or swimming for several miles is needed to keep him physically and mentally healthy. However, because of the adverse effect of strenuous exercise on growing joints and bones, you should limit exercise among puppies and adolescent Otterhounds (and among those with hip dysplasia). Swimming is the best exercise for younger dogs, because the risk of joint injury is minimal.Otterhounds are enthusiastic and loud barkers. But don't expect yours to be a guard dog — he's far too friendly for that.Don't allow your Otterhound off-leash in unfenced areas; you never know when he might catch an enticing scent and run off.Otterhounds enjoy being outdoors, but they're best suited to living daily life inside the house with their families.A fenced yard is mandatory. Otterhounds have been known to jump fences as high as five feet, so be sure the fencing is at least six feet tall.The Otterhound is affectionate, but he's also independent. He won't follow you around, begging for attention. He'll probably greet you when you get home, and then — if he doesn't need exercise — he'll return to his favorite snoozing spot.The Otterhound loves food and can become obese if you don't monitor his diet. Also, his incredible sense of smell enables him to locate those special goodies you've hidden in the cabinets, and his size and cleverness enable him to find a way to get at them.Big dog, bigger expense. Everything for a big dog costs more, from food to grooming to veterinary care.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males are approximately 27 inches tall and weigh about 115 pounds. Females are approximately 24 inches tall and weigh about 80 pounds.,"The Otterhound is an amiable fellow, with plenty of affection for every member of the family. He loves children, though he can play a little rough (not purposely) due to his large size. He is devoted to his family, but not overly so.He's likely to extend happy greetings when you come home at the end of the day, but don't expect him to follow you from room to room. He's too independent for that.The Otterhound's characteristic independence makes training challenging. You have to convince him that he wants to do what you're asking. This is entirely possible, as long as you are patient and skilled.The good-natured Otterhound is not a top candidate for a watchdog. He'll sound a loud warning bark to intruders, but that's about it.As with every dog, the Otterhound needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Otterhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Otterhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Otterhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Otterhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Gastric dilatation-volvulus: Also called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs such as Otterhounds. This is especially true if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.Hip Dysplasia: In this inherited condition, the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Canine Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia (CIT): Also called immune mediated thrombocytopenia or ITP, this condition results from an immune system disorder in which there are not enough platelets. CIT is more common in female dogs than in males, and it runs primarily in a few Otterhound lines. Symptoms include abnormal bleeding under the skin or gums.","Because of his large size and high activity needs, the Otterhound is not recommended for apartment dwellers or families without yards. He's perfect, however, for active families who can take him jogging or, better yet, swimming each day. If he has enough exercise, he's relatively inactive when inside the house.In temperate and cool climates, the Otterhound can sleep outdoors if he has adequate shelter. However, since he loves to be near his family, in spite of his independent nature, he can become bored and start barking, digging, or trying to escape if left alone too much. Invisible electric fences are not adequate for containing the Otterhound.Training and socialization are essential for the Otterhound, beginning with puppy classes. Incorporate socialization with training by taking your Otterhound pup with you wherever he's allowed, be it the lumber yard, the pet supply store, outdoor events, or on long walks in busy parks. Anyplace where there are a lot of people to meet and sights to see is a good place to take an Otterhound.Just don't let your Otterhound off his leash in such places, even if you think he'll come reliably when called. His instinct is to follow his nose, and that, coupled with his independent nature, means he's likely to give take off after any interesting scent.","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Do not overfeed the Otterhound, and feed in meals rather than leaving food available at all times. Limit treats and encourage activity. Keep food safely locked away, too, to prevent thievery!Keep your Otterhound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Otterhound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","You might say the messy look is ""in"" with the Otterhound. This characteristically scruffy-looking breed has a double coat. The outer coat is two to six inches long, rough and very thick. The undercoat is woolly and slightly oily. With this combination, the Otterhound is relatively weather-resistant, and he can bound in and out of streams and lakes without the undercoat absorbing a great deal of water.The Otterhound's coat color is any recognized hound color except liver and white, all white, or white with distinct black and tan patches. Black and tan grizzle is common.The shaggy Otterhound coat sheds and must be brushed at least once a week to avoid matting. Some Otterhounds have softer coats that require brushing at least two to three times a week to prevent mats.The Otterhound coat is best kept au naturel, so it is not clipped. If you decide to clip because the coat is matted, or because your dog has a skin condition, it takes about two years for the coat to grow back to its original length. You may need to wash his beard daily, because it tends to drag in his food or on the ground; and if you don't keep the beard clean, it can develop an unpleasant odor.Brush your Otterhound's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Since they are long and hang down, they don't allow the best air circulation, and ear infections can result. His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Otterhound to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Otterhounds are boisterous, fun-loving dogs, but because of their size and tendency toward clumsiness, you should supervise them when they are with small children. They love children and wouldn't hurt them intentionally, but their size and exuberance might cause them to knock a small child to the ground. The Otterhound is probably better suited to a family with older children, ages 10 and up.If properly trained and socialized, the Otterhound gets along well with other dogs. Use caution when introducing him to small pets, however. The Otterhound's hunting instinct is strong, and he's likely to chase animals he perceives as prey.","Otterhounds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Otterhounds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward an Otterhound rescue.Otterhound Club of America",not available

He should never be shy or aggressive. This is, however, a take-charge little dog with a moderate to intense activity level. He's very smart and highly trainable and is best described as a doer, not a cuddler.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, is a possible problem with all toy breed puppies. Hypoglycemia is easily treatable in the early stages but can be fatal if not treated. It is important that breeders and owners of toy breed puppies recognize the signs and symptoms because this condition can often be misdiagnosed as viral hepatitis or encephalitis by veterinarians. A puppy with hypoglycemia will slow down and become listless, followed by trembling or shivering. Place some honey under his tongue and get him to the vet immediately. If the situation is allowed to continue, he'll eventually collapse, go into convulsions, fall into a coma, and die. Any time your Papillon is limp, with grayish-blue gums and tongue, it's an emergency. Hypoglycemia occurs in toy puppies because they do not have the fat reserves to supply adequate glucose in times of stress or when they do not eat regularly.Collapsed Trachea: It is not completely understood how this occurs, but the rapid inhalation of air causes the trachea to flatten and makes it difficult for air to enter the lungs, much like a soda straw being drawn on too vigorously. This condition may be inherited; it occurs in certain breeds, and dogs with it show an abnormality in the chemical makeup of their tracheal rings in which the rings lose their stiffness and become unable to retain their circular shape.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Open Fontanel: Papillons are born with a soft spot on the top of their head. Usually the soft spot closes, much like a baby's will, but sometimes one will not close fully. An accidental blow to that spot on the head could kill a Papillon with an unclosed soft spot.","Papillons are housedogs and aren't suited to living outdoors. They are active, however, and will enjoy having a yard where they can run in wild, fast circles. If that's not available, however, they'll make do with tearing through your house and jumping on and off the furniture. They are often described as mountain goats, so don't be surprised if you find yours up on the kitchen table or some other high spot.Adults need two or three 20- to 30-minute walks or playtimes per day, and they'll appreciate more if you can provide it. Start puppies with two or three 10- to 15-minute walks and gradually increase the time and distance. Puppy or adult, they'll let you know if they're getting tired by stopping or sitting.Although they grow up to be sturdy little dogs, Papillon puppies can be fragile. They can easily break a leg soaring off the back of the sofa or jumping off the bed, so try to avoid such situations by teaching them to use steps to get on and off furniture or waiting until you lift them down.Papillons are easy to housetrain if you keep them on a schedule. Always take them out when they first wake up in the morning, after every meal, after naps, after playtime, after a grooming session or bath, and just before bedtime. When you can't supervise them, they should be crated or placed in a puppy-proofed room.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Papillon doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Papillon accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Papillon in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Papillons are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.Train your Papillon using positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play, and you will soon find that he can learn anything you can teach.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Papillon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Papillon's long, flowing coat is straight, fine, and silky, with no undercoat. Cascading down his chest is a frill of hair. His beautiful butterfly-like ears are fringed with hair, and the insides are covered with medium-length silken hair. Feathering covers the backs of the forelegs, and the hind legs are dressed in breeches, a fringe of longish hair on the thigh area, also known as culottes. Topping it all off is a long, flowing plume of a tail carried proudly arched over the body.The Papillon is always parti-colored, white with patches of any color. On the head, any color other than white covers both ears back and front and extends without interruption from the ears over both eyes. The ideal Papillon has a clearly defined white blaze and nose band, but one with a solidly marked head still makes a great companion. The nose, eye rims, and lips are black.The coat isn't prone to matting but should be combed and brushed once or twice a week to distribute the natural skin oils and keep the hair and skin healthy. The Papillon doesn't have a doggie odor, so bathe him only as needed. He's a wash-and-go kind of dog. Trim nails two or three times a month or as needed. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Small dogs are prone to periodontal disease, so start dental hygiene early. Brushing your Papillon's teeth two or three times a week — daily if possible — will help keep them clean and tartar-free.","Papillons love children, but the combination of a tiny dog and a young child can be a recipe for disaster. A Papillon may leap from a child's hands and injure himself if he's not being held correctly, and he won't hesitate to defend himself if he's being mistreated. Many breeders won't sell puppies to families with toddlers for fear that the dog will be injured.Make it a rule that young children can only hold or pet the Papillon if they're sitting on the floor. Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Papillons get along well with other pets in the family, including cats, if introduced at a young age. The fearless Papillon will often boss around dogs much bigger than he is, and this may or may not cause problems. It's not unusual for the smallest dog to be the one in charge.","Papillons are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Multigenerational breedings (Peekapoo to Peekapoo) are rare. If you're interested in a Peekapoo puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren't as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don't know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog.The Peekapoo is an active and energetic dog. He requires daily exercise and does well with a good walk or romp in the yard. Don't overexercise a Peekapoo to the point of respiratory distress.Peekapoos can suffer from heat exhaustion quickly. They do best in a home that has air-conditioning.Barking is a favorite pastime for a Peekapoo. They make excellent watchdogs and will alert bark at people or things they think are suspicious.A clipped Peekapoo only requires about two brushings per week, while a Peekapoo with a full, natural coat will require daily brushing.Loving and gentle, the Peekapoo can make an excellent companion to older, more considerate children.Peekapoos generally do well with other dogs and pets if they're introduced to them at a young age.Peekapoos can be easy to train with positive reinforcement.With his small stature, the Peekapoo can make an excellent apartment dweller, but he's happiest with a yard in which to enjoy the great outdoors.Peekapoos may suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods at a time.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","There is no breed standard, so there's nothing for breeders to conform to. Therefore, the Peekapoo is seen in a range of sizes. He averages up to 11 inches in height, and he can range in weight from 4 to 20 pounds.","The Peekapoo is a loving and loyal dog who is dedicated to his family. An ideal lapdog, he delights in being part of every family activity. He is gentle and rarely combative. He is an intelligent dog who is happiest with his owner, especially out in the great outdoors. Protective of his family, he'll defend them with everything in that small body.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Because he's naturally suspicious of strangers and new dogs, early and ongoing socialization is a must for the Peekapoo. If not properly socialized, he can be slightly aggressive or timid. That's true of any dog, but particularly so for those who tend toward being wary of strangers.Enrolling your young Peekapoo in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start down the road of socialization. Inviting visitors over regularly, taking him to busy parks and stores that allow dogs, and going on leisurely strolls to meet the neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","The notion of hybrid vigor is worth understanding if you're looking for a Peekapoo. Hybrid vigor isn't necessarily characteristic of mixed breeds; it occurs when new blood is brought in from outside the usual breeding circle — it's the opposite of inbreeding.However, there is a general misconception that hybrid vigor automatically applies to mixed breeds. If the genetic pool for the mixed breed remains the same over time, the offspring won't have hybrid vigor. And if a purebred breeder brings in a dog from a different line, those puppies will have hybrid vigor, even though they're purebred.Peekapoos are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Peekapoos will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Before you bring home your Peekapoo, find out if he's from a first-generation or multigenerational breeding (although multigenerational breedings are rare in Peekapoos). If he's a first-generation dog, research the health concerns that occur in both Pekinese and Toy or Miniature Poodles. Regardless of generation, all parents should have the applicable health clearances.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Peekapoos, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This affliction involves the hip joint, usually in small dogs. If your Peekapoo has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is another common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.","The Peekapoo is an active little dog who requires daily exercise to stay healthy and happy. Unwanted energy can lead to destructive behavior, and it's shocking — truly shocking — how much damage a small, bored dog can do. A Peekapoo enjoys being outside and likes to play in the yard and go for walks (all walks are considered nice walks).However, don't overexercise a Peekapoo; brachycephalic dogs with flat faces, such as Pekingese, Pugs, and some Peekapoos, can easily overheat and develop respiratory troubles as a result. And remember that a high-energy small dog won't require as much exercise as a high-energy large dog.The Peekapoo can be trained easily with the use of positive reinforcement. Harsh corrections should not be used with a Peekapoo, since they can literally hurt him.A Peekapoo can adapt to any type of dwelling, including apartments, but they do much better with a small fenced yard to access, since they enjoy being outdoors. They should not be left unattended outside, however, since they can become prey for larger dogs and animals in the neighborhood.A Peekapoo should also live in a home with air-conditioning, since they can be susceptible to heat exhaustion. A Peekapoo should never be exercised or left outside on unusually hot days.Peekapoos are noisy and will alert bark whenever they see something or someone suspicious. That's not always a barrel of laughs, but at least they make great watchdogs.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Peekapoo doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Peekapoo accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Peekapoo in a crate all day long, however.

It should be wavy and of medium to long length. There is no undercoat. The desired coat is low-shedding, but a Peekapoo can range from low to average shedding, depending on the roll of the genetic dice.Coat colors run a tremendous range, from silver, gray, white, sable, red, cream, apricot, chocolate, to buff and black. The Peekapoo can also have a variety of markings, including phantom, which is black with tan markings.A Peekapoo's fine coat requires regular grooming to stay healthy and free of tangles. He requires some care in keeping the Pekingese-based wrinkles and folds around the eyes, muzzle, ears, and nose free of dirt and debris. The Peekapoo can be clipped for easier care, but he still requires regular brushing and bathing. If his coat is kept long, then it will need to be brushed daily to avoid tangles and mats. Occasionally hair can cause some irritation to the eyes. If this happens, pluck the offending hair regularly.Check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.Brush your Peekapoo's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your short Peekapoo enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Peekapoo to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin or feet and in the nose, mouth, and eyes. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","A Peekapoo can make a loving companion to any child if properly introduced to children from a young age. The Peekapoo is naturally suspicious of new people, and a loud, rambunctious kid may be too much for an older Peekapoo to handle. And even though a socialized Peekapoo is gentle with youngsters, he's not suited to homes with small children who may unintentionally hurt him — a Peekapoo can be injured easily.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Peekapoo also does well with other dogs and pets, but again, early socialization is the key to success. Otherwise the Peekapoo can be combative and aggressive toward new dogs and pets.","Peekapoos are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Peekapoos in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Peekapoo rescue.Poo-Mix Rescue",not available

The folds should be kept clean and dry.Pekes have a tendency to gain weight if overfed.A Peke may go on a hunger strike just to prove a point over his owner.Pekingese tend to bark a lot.The breed can be difficult to housebreak.Pekingese tend to be one-person dogs.Because of their profuse coat and short noses, they do not tolerate heat well.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The Pekingese is heavy for his size with a stocky, muscular body. He is 6 to 9 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs 7 to 14 pounds. In imperial China, Pekingese that weighed less than six pounds were called ""sleeve dogs"" and rode in the sleeve cuffs of the robes worn by members of the imperial court.","He may look foofy, but the Pekingese is a stand-up character who's tougher and braver than his appearance suggests. The Peke's regal dignity, self-importance, confidence, and stubborn streak all come together in a lively, affectionate, good-natured dog who'll respect you if you respect him. He's loyal to and protective of his people, barking in warning when strangers appear. Train him with firm, kind consistency, using positive reinforcements such as food rewards and praise. You will always succeed if you can persuade the Peke that doing something is his idea, not yours.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Pekingese need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Peke puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Pekingese are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pekes will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pekes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Brachycephalic Syndrome: The full name for the condition is brachycephalic airway obstruction syndrome (BAOS). This condition occurs in those breeds that have been selectively bred to have a shortened face. These dogs have some problem with breathing from the time they are born. The exaggerated features that occur with their anatomy include an elongated and fleshy soft palate, narrowed nostrils, changes to the larynx, and a relatively small trachea. Problems vary according to the severity of the disease. Most brachycephalic dogs snuffle and snort to some degree. Some have no other problems; others have increasingly noisy breathing, coughing, gagging, fainting, and collapsing episodes and a decreased tolerance for exercise. Overheating is especially dangerous for these breeds because panting causes more swelling and narrowing of the airway, increasing the dogs' anxiety. Treatment can include keeping dog from becoming overweight, corticosteroids for short term relief of airway inflammation, and surgical shortening of the soft palate if it is elongated.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Cleft Palate: The palate is the roof of the mouth and separates the nasal and oral cavities. It is made up of two parts, hard and soft. A cleft palate has a slit that runs bilaterally or unilaterally and can range in size from a small hole to a large slit. A cleft palate can affect both the hard and soft palate separately and together and may cause a cleft lip. Puppies can be born with cleft palates, or a cleft palate can occur from an injury. Cleft palates are fairly common in dogs, but many puppies born with a cleft palate do not survive or are euthanized by the breeder. The only treatment for a cleft palate is surgery to close the hole, although not all dogs with a cleft palate require the surgery. It is important to get a diagnosis and treatment recommendation from your veterinarian.Cryptorchidism: Cryptorchidism is a condition in which one or both testicles on the dog fail to descend and is common in small dogs. Testicles should descend fully by the time the puppy is 2 months old. If a testicle is retained, it is usually nonfunctional and can become cancerous if it is not removed. The treatment that is suggested is to neuter your dog. When the neutering takes place, a small incision is made to remove the undescended testicle(s); the normal testicle, if any, is removed in the regular manner.Distichiasis: This condition occurs when an additional row of eyelashes (known as distichia) grow on the oil gland in the dog's eye and protrude along the edge of the eyelid. This irritates the eye, and you may notice your Aussie squinting or rubbing his eye(s). Distichiasis is treated surgically by freezing the excess eyelashes with liquid nitrogen and then remove them. This type of surgery is called cryoepilation and is done under general anesthesia.Ectopic Cilia: An abnormality of eyelash growth in which extra eyelashes grow through the eyelid to the inside. One or more ectopic cilia may be present. Clinical signs of discomfort vary according to the number of abnormal cilia and whether they are fine or coarse. This type of eyelash abnormality is particularly irritating to the eye and more likely to cause corneal ulcers. Treatment consists of treating any corneal ulcers that have occurred with antibiotics and surgical removal of the aberrant follicle.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Pekingese has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if he doesn't outgrow it by adulthood.Fold Dermatitis: A skin infection caused by folds in the skin in which rubbing occurs or moisture gets trapped. It is more commonly found in breeds that have folds in the skin such as Pekingese. The signs of fold dermatitis are redness, sores, and odor, and the dog can be affected on the tail, face, lips, vulvar folds, and any other fold on the body. The treatment for fold dermatitis varies depending on the area affected, but it can include surgical removal of the folds or amputation of the tail in the case of fold dermatitis on the tail. It can also include topical antibiotic ointments. The best means of treatment is to properly maintain your dog's coat to prevent the condition.Hydrocephalus: Occurs when the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain accumulates because of a congenital defect, obstruction, or the result of perinatal trauma, placing pressure on the brain. This usually occurs in young dogs under the age of 18 months and older dogs that are more than 6 years old. If hydrocephalus is left untreated, the dog will die. Treatment consists of medical treatment and surgery where either the obstruction is removed or a shunt is inserted.Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca, or dry eye, is caused when the eyes don't produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform a Schirmer tear test to diagnose dry eye, which can be controlled with medication and special care. This eye condition requires life-long therapy and care.Mitral Valve Disease: This defect in the mitral valve of the heart causes a backup of blood into the left atrium, known as mitral regurgitation. This causes the heart to be less efficient at pumping the blood. It is the most common acquired cardiac disease, affecting more than one-third of dogs over ten years of age. There are several breeds that are genetically predisposed to acquire the condition at a much younger age, and the Pekingese is one of them. If your veterinarian hears a heart murmur, your Peke should be evaluated by a veterinary cardiologist.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Exposure Keratopathy Syndrome: This syndrome can be caused by a number of factors such as exophthalmos, which is a protrusion of the eyeball, macroblepharon, which is a large eyelid opening, and lagophthalmos, which is an inability to completely close the eyelid. These factors cause the cornea to be exposed, resulting in an inability to blink properly and the easy evaporation of tears. The syndrome can lead to corneal ulcers, and a pigmentation of the cornea that may cause vision impairment. Signs are generally red eyes, increased tears, and pawing at the eyes. Treatment for Exposure Keratopathy Syndrome is usually various surgeries, but tear substitutes have been used as a temporary treatment.Intervertebral Disk Disease: The spinal cord is surrounded by the vertebral column, and between the bones of the vertebral column are intervertebral discs that work as shock absorbers and allow normal movement of the vertebrae. The discs are made of two layers, an outer fibrous layer and an inner jelly-like layer. Intervertebral disc disease occurs when the jelly like inner layer protrudes into the spinal canal and pushes against the spinal cord. Compression of the spinal cord may be minimal, causing neck or back pain, or it can be severe, causing loss of sensation, paralysis, and lack of bowel or bladder control. The damage done by the spinal compression may be irreversible. Treatment is based on several factors, including location, severity, and length of time between injury and treatment. Confining the dog may be of some use, but surgery is often needed to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. Surgery is not always successful.","Pekingese make good apartment dogs, and of course they'll be equally happy in a mansion. They love to run and romp but need a fenced area because they will explore and may wander off. Pekingese appreciate going for walks and will be excellent company jaunting through the neighborhood with you. They will run around the house, especially with another Peke or other dog. Despite their heavy coat, Pekingese are housedogs and should not live outdoors. Their short noses make them sensitive to heat, so they need to live in an air-conditioned environment.Pekes are stubborn and can be difficult to train. They won't respond at all to harsh corrections or training methods. Reward them any time they do something you like, and be creative in persuading them that what you want them to do is their idea and worth their while.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Pekes are meant to be stocky, muscular dogs who feel heavy when lifted, but they shouldn't be fat. Keep your Pekingese in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs fewer bonbons and more exercise.For more on feeding your Peke, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Pekingese wears a coat that is long, coarse, and straight, standing away from the body like a furry halo. Beneath the topcoat is a thick, soft undercoat. True to his description as a lion dog, the Pekingese has a noticeable mane on the neck and shoulder area, with the coat on the rest of the body being somewhat shorter. While it should be long and profuse, the coat should not obscure the shape of the body. Long feathering is found on the backs of the legs and on the toes, with longer fringing on the ears and tail.The Peke's coat can be any color or have any markings, including black and tan, fawn or red brindle, and particolor, which is white with another color. He may or may not have a black mask. Solid white Pekingese were highly prized by the Chinese and are still popular today. Regardless of coat color, the exposed skin of the muzzle, nose, lips, and eye rims is black.Unless you're showing him, you can brush your Peke's coat weekly with a small bristle brush, curry brush, or shedding comb. Before brushing, mist the coat lightly with water to prevent the hair from breaking. Brush all the way down to the skin; if you just go over the top of the coat, you won't get out the dead hair that forms mats and tangles. Continue to mist the hair as you brush each area of the body. Use a metal comb on the feathering and fringing on the legs, ears, and tail. These areas tangle easily, so comb them daily.Clean the face and around the eyes daily with a damp cotton ball to prevent problems with the skin folds in the area. Keep skin folds clean and dry to prevent infections. Any time your Peke gets wet, thoroughly dry the skin folds until no dampness remains.Bathe your Pekingese once or twice a month, as needed. Use a shampoo made for dogs so you don't dry out his coat. You can also shake on a dry dog shampoo and then brush it out.Trim the hair on the feet to prevent mats from developing and foreign objects from becoming tangled there. Trim the nails regularly, usually every two or three weeks. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Teaching your Peke puppy to accept having his teeth brushed at least weekly (daily is better) can help prevent dental disease later in life, a common problem in small dogs.","A Pekingese is not a good choice for families with toddlers who may treat him roughly without meaning to. The Peke won't tolerate being grabbed or poked and won't hesitate to defend himself.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Pekes prefer the company of other Pekingese, but with early socialization they can learn to get along with other dogs (and cats) and may even rule over dogs that are 20 times their size.","Pekingese are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They are known for being happy, loving, and intelligent, but with a stubborn or independent streak at times. They are easy to train, but don't expect your Pembroke to be subservient. They like to think for themselves.Although they want to please their owners, food is a great motivator for them when training. Proceed with caution: Pembrokes love to eat and can become obese if their food intake isn't moderated.Pembrokes also make good watchdogs.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Cataracts: This affliction causes opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve visionCutaneous Asthenia: Also known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, dermatosparaxis, or dominant collagen dysplasia, this condition causes defective connective tissue in the skin to become fragile, loose, and stretchy. Blood vessels are also affected, leading to excessive bruising and blood blisters.Cystinuria: This is a condition where high levels of a protein, called cystine, are excreted in the urine, and may indicate stone formation. This is usually a problem only in males.Degenerative Myelopathy (DM): This is a progressive degeneration of the nervous and supportive tissue of the spinal cord in the lower back region. It causes rear leg lameness, weakness and eventual paralysis and is often misdiagnosed as disk disease.Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Intervertebral Disk Disease: Because of their long backs, Pembrokes are prone to ruptures in a spinal disk. Symptoms include unsteadiness, problems with going up or down stairs and furniture, knuckling over of limbs, weakness, and paralysis.Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) with Pulmonary Hypertension: PDA is a congenital defect of the vascular system that allows unoxygenated blood to bypass the lungs. It is usually detected in puppies during veterinary examination. Pulmonary hypertension is high blood pressure within the lungs and is a rare part of the PDA disease. PDA can be surgically corrected.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Retinal Dysplasia: This is an abnormal development of the retina. Sometimes the retina may detach and cause blindness.Von Willebrand's Disease: Found in both dogs and humans, this is a blood disorder that affects the clotting process. An affected dog will have symptoms such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping, and occasionally blood in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed between three and five years of age, and it can't be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions before surgery, and avoidance of specific medications.","Athletic and surprisingly fast, Pembrokes were bred to be herding dogs and require plenty of exercise each day. That said, they make fine apartment dogs as long as they get the physical stimulation they need.With their short legs and long backs, they should not be expected to hop up on (or down from) the couch or any other modest height — fractures are common.Pems can adapt quite easily to living in the country or the city. Although their coats are weather-resistant and they do well in most climates, they are very people-oriented, and need to be a part of the family at all times — not left alone in the backyard.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Pembroke, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Pembrokes are double-coated, with a thick undercoat and a longer topcoat. They shed continuously, with heavier shedding at least twice a year. You'll find them in red, sable, black, tri-colored, or fawn, usually with white markings.The length of the coat varies on the body. Some Pems have fluffy coats — long with excessive feathering on the ears, chest, legs and feet.Many Pembrokes have what is called a ""fairy saddle"" over their back. This marking, which is caused by a change in thickness and direction of a strip of hair, gets its name from legend: According to one, fairies rode Pembrokes in their home country of Wales.Pembrokes are easy to groom, but shedding can be a problem if you don't keep up with the brushing, especially during the heavier seasonal shedding. When they are shedding the most, daily brushing is recommended. You only need to bathe them as needed, but many people find that regular bathing also helps control heavy shedding.Brush your Pembroke's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Pembroke to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy.

Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Pembrokes have a remarkable affinity for children, but thanks to their herding instincts, they sometimes nip at children's feet or ankles.

In PBGVs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).PBGV Pain Syndrome: This is a miserable condition that affects 6- to 18-month-old dogs. Symptoms include bouts of pain, fever, and/or listlessness. The intensity of the pain varies from very mild in some dogs to quite severe in others. Some dogs suffer only a single episode, but most affected dogs have several. One of the more severe forms of this condition affects the cervical area of the neck, giving the problem its common names: the ""neck thing"" and, more formally, steroid-responsive meningitis. Most dogs outgrow the problem, but some can suffer permanent complications.Epilepsy: This is a puzzling condition that causes dogs to experience seizures for no apparent reason. Some affected dogs experience only one or a few seizures during their lifetime, while others have seizure a regular basis. If necessary, this condition can usually (but not always) be managed successfully with medication.Glaucoma and lens luxation. Glaucoma and lens luxation are eye problems that have been identified in PBGVs only recently. In glaucoma, the pressure inside the eyeball increases and eventually damages the optic nerve, causing blindness. In lens luxation, the lens tilts out if its normal position, causing blindness. Usually, both eyes are affected. These conditions strike dogs around 5 years of age and generally occur together.Allergies: In PBGVs, allergies manifest themselves primarily as chronic inflammation of the ears or as redness of the feet or armpits. In addition to these non-specific allergies, PBGVs can suffer from food allergy, fleabite allergy, hay fever, and vaccine reactions. Most allergies cause only itching, but in some cases, dogs can suffer a great deal of discomfort. Be especially watchful of your dog for a several hours after he has been vaccinated.Inguinal and Umbilical Hernias: Inguinal and umbilical hernias are defects of the abdomen muscles that allow internal organs to protrude and form a bubble under the skin on the belly (umbilical hernia) or in the groin (inguinal hernia). The condition sometimes corrects itself as the puppy grows, but surgery may be required.Patellar Luxation and Hip Dysplasia: Patellar luxation (""trick knee"") and hip dysplasia are caused by the abnormal development of the knee and hip joints, respectively. Patellar luxation, also called slipping kneecaps, is more common in PBGVs than hip dysplasia. Either can lead to lameness and arthritis in old age. Your vet will be able to tell if this is a potential problem and may want to do x-rays to evaluate the condition. Treatment often consists of giving the dog nutritional supplements, and may occasionally require surgery.Hypothyroidism: This is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormones. Symptoms include obesity, lethargy, poor coat quality, dry, scaly skin, intolerance to cold and, some think, irritability or aggression. Middle-age and older dogs appear to be the most affected, but symptoms can appear at any age. This condition usually can be effectively treated with medication.Persistent Pupillary Pembranes (PPM) and Multifocal Retinal Dysplasia: Persistent pupillary membranes and multifocal retinal dysplasia (retinal folds) are congenital eye defects. Fortunately, the dog's vision usually isn't affected, many consider these primarily cosmetic defects.","Because of their small size and love of being with people, PBGVs can be apartment dwellers as long as you make the commitment to daily exercise. They are generally active when inside the house, so it good to have plenty of sturdy toys on hand. While they do well in most climates, they prefer cooler temperatures.The breed's nose and hunting instinct is strong, so the PBGV should not be allowed to run off-leash. A secure, fenced yard is best.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your PBGV, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The PBGV's coat is rough, medium long, and harsh to the touch, while his undercoat is thick, soft and short. He has long eyebrows that stick out so they don't obscure the eyes, and the ears are covered with long hair. They also have long hair around their mouths, forming a beard and moustache. Their tails have quite a bit of hair, too. Overall, the PBGV has a casual, tousled appearance.PBGVs come in a wide range of colors and can be white with any combination of lemon, orange, black, sable, tricolor, or grizzle markings.Grooming is a cinch. PBGVs need to be brushed at least once a week to remove loose and dead hair, and control shedding. You should bathe your PBGV only when needed. The toenails need to be trimmed periodically, and ears checked and cleaned as needed. No trimming is necessary.","The friendly PBGV loves children. He enjoys the noise and activity associated with children. Adults should always supervise interactions between children and pets; this is especially important with the PBGV is ensure that gates or doors are not left open, giving him an opportunity to escape.The PBV can be trustworthy with other pets, given proper training and socialization. He especially enjoys the companionship of other dogs. He is a hunter at heart, though, and is likely to chase small animals that run away.","PBGVs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many PBGVs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a PBGV rescue.The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen Club of America Health and Rescue Foundation",not available
Pharaoh Hound,4,4,4,5,2,1,5,5,5,5,5,4,3,2,1,4,5,3,3,4,3,4,4,5,4,4,2,3,4,4,Hound Dogs,"1 foot, 9 inches to 2 feet, 1 inch tall at the shoulder",45 to 55 pounds,11 to 14 years,"Introduce your Hound to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences, preferably as a puppy. He can be sensitive to changes in schedules and stress, and an unsocialized dog has a harder time adapting to abrupt changes. A properly socialized is a polite and undemanding dog who is wonderful with strangers and other dogs.Pharaoh Hounds can get cold very easily, but they can live in a chilly climate if they're kept indoors and wear a warm coat on wintertime walks.Don't let your Pharaoh Hound run off-leash in an unfenced area. He's got a strong prey drive and will chase other animals for miles. Backyard fences should be too high to jump or climb, and preferably solid so he can't see through it. Underground electronic fencing won't stop a Pharaoh Hound with something interesting in his sights.Pharaoh Hounds can do well in homes with other canines but smaller dogs may trigger their prey drive — as will small pets such as cats and rabbits — and some Pharaoh Hounds are aggressive toward dogs of the same gender.Although sighthounds are not known as barkers, the Pharaoh Hound is an exception. They bark when chasing prey, when they see intruders or hear an unusual noise, or when bored. They can indulge in long bark-a-thons, usually when you're away from the house, which could cause problems if you live in a place with noise restrictions or neighbors that could be disturbed.Pharaoh Hounds are low to average shedders depending on the time of the year and the individual dog. The thin coat leaves their skin vulnerable to scrapes, tears and nicks.Coprophagia, better known as stool eating, is commonly seen in the Pharaoh Hound. The best way to avoid this habit is to scoop the poop right away.Pharaoh Hounds require at least 30 minutes of exercise per day.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The athletic Pharaoh Hound has a lithe and powerful build. They should be slightly longer than they are tall, with males standing 23 to 25 inches at the shoulder, females 21 to 24 inches. Pharaoh Hounds generally weigh 45 to 55 pounds.","Pharaoh Hounds love their own people and happily entertain them with their clownish antics. The flip side is that they can be aloof with new people.This is a dog who likes to have his own way. Still, he's smart and willing to please — most of the time — which generally makes training easy.The Pharaoh Hound can be a bit of a sensitive plant. He picks up on people's feelings and may find a high-drama home very stressful. It's always important to introduce a dog to lots of new people and situations as a puppy, but this is particularly true with a Pharaoh who can grow up to be timid.Enroll your Hound in a class. Help him polish his social skills, and invite visitors over regularly, and take him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors.","Pharaoh Hounds are generally healthy, but as with breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pharaoh Hounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Anesthesia Sensitivity: Pharaoh Hounds are not as sensitive to anesthesia as other sighthounds, but your veterinarian should be aware of the potential risks. The most important rule is to administer to effectiveness not weight. Because of their low body fat, sighthounds can be sensitive to anesthesia, and what would be a normal dose for another dog of his weight can harm or even kill a sighthound. Pharaoh Hounds are less sensitive than some other breeds, but you'll need to find a vet who's aware of the risks and knows how to dose your dog properly if he ever needs anesthesia.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types: food-based allergies, which are treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. It is important to note that ear infections often accompany inhalant allergies.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Pharaoh Hounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).","With their calm nature, Pharaoh Hounds can live in an apartment or condo, though his barking has the potential to annoy close neighbors.If you leave him in a yard, you'll need a fence that's too high for him to climb or jump, preferably solid so he can't see the squirrels or cats on the other side. Electronic fencing won't cut it with this breed — no shock will stop a Pharaoh Hound once he decides to chase something.Because of his thin skin, he gets cold easily and will need a dog sweater or jacket when venturing out on cold or wet days.If you want a well-behaved dog, you'll need to make sure your high-energy Pharaoh Hound gets at least 30 minutes of exercise a day. This dog can participate in lure coursing and agility, or come with you on a family jog or bike ride.Just make sure you keep him on a leash whenever you're in an unfenced area. If he sees something small and furry, his strong prey drive will overcome the best training every time.When he's not distracted by something chase-worthy, however, his intelligence and eagerness to please makes him fairly easy to train.Just make sure you keep lesson time interesting and pleasant; harsh or repetitive training methods don't work with his sensitive, fun-loving personality. Keep training sessions short and end with something he's done right so you can praise him for it.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Don't be fooled into overfeeding; sighthounds have a slim build that many mistake as being underweight. Some Pharaoh Hounds suffer from food allergies; if your dog's one of them, your vet can recommend a special diet.Keep your Pharaoh Hound in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Pharaoh Hound, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Pharaoh Hound has a short coat with a fine to slightly harsh texture. His color ranges from a rich tan to a chestnut tan. He may have a dab of white on the tip of the tail, the toes, the chest, or on the center of the face.The Pharaoh Hound sheds (as do all dogs) but a weekly brushing with a hound glove — a rubber mitt with a nubby palm that fits over the hand — removes loose hair and helps keep it from settling on your clothes and furniture.Pharaoh Hounds don't have a strong doggy odor and don't need frequent baths. Unless he's been rolling around in something stinky, wiping him down daily with a damp cloth will in most cases keep him clean.Your Pharaoh Hound's skin will need some care too. The short coat isn't very protective, and cuts, scrapes, and other irritations are common. Check your dog for nicks and cuts every time you brush him.Brush your Pharaoh Hound's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Check his ears weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Introduce your Pharaoh Hound to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Pharaoh Hounds are very affectionate with children. Nonetheless, as with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Pharaoh Hounds generally get along with other dogs, although some are aggressive toward dogs of the same gender. And because they see small animals as prey, Pharaoh Hounds aren't suited to sharing a roof with small pets such as rabbits or cats, or even smaller dogs.","Pharaoh Hounds are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Pharaoh Hound rescue.SPAR — Sighthound Placement & ReferralPharaoh Hound Club of America Rescue",not available

They are not purebreds like their American Pit Bull Terrier or Siberian Husky parents.No two Pitskies are the same, and they can vary quite a bit in size. It may be difficult to tell how big a puppy will be when they're fully grown.Pitskies typically come in white, black, brown, grey, brindle, and every combination and variation of those colors.Pitskies usually have short coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers, as their coats tend to shed less than average. There are longer-coated Pitskies, too, though they may not be as allergy friendly.Most Pitskies are very loyal to their families and kid friendly. Some may have a natural tendency to be apprehensive or rough with other pets, but early training and socialization can help overcome these tendencies.The Pitsky tends to require a lot of exercise. Most need two hours of activity per day. They make great workout partners and running buddies.","As the Pitsky is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Siberian Husky and American Pit Bull Terrier parents, you can expect the dog to be on the medium to large side.Most weigh in at 30 to 80 pounds and range in height from 16 to 25 inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be smaller or larger.","Pitskies are a great choice for an active person who is a very involved and hands-on dog parent. Both the Siberian Husky and the American Pit Bull Terrier require a skilled dog parent, and their offspring, the Pitsky is the same.Pitsky skills include sledding, racing, guarding, and hunting. They are fiercely loyal to their families and would not hesitate to lay down their lives for a loved one.These pups can be stubborn and difficult to train, but for an energetic, consistent owner, their loyalty and desire to please will go far. Early training is strongly recommended.They are smart and athletic, playful and affectionate and would be well suited for a person who has had a lot of experience with either parent dog breed--and preferably both.","The Pitsky mixed breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Siberian Husky and American Pit Bull Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Pitskies who are fed well and get proper exercise are pretty healthy dogs. A few health issues to keep and eye out for include:HyperthyroidismHip dysplasiaCataractsAllergies","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Pitsky's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.These pups require a great deal of exercise. They have a lot of stamina and would be well suited for a backpacker or someone who is on their feet a lot and would love to have a pup by their side. Outdoor enthusiasts, this could be your new best friend. A minimum of two hours a day of exercise is recommended.Make sure you keep up with standard canine care routines. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking loudly against the floor.It's also important to maintain their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily and give them dental chews intermittently. Your vet will be able to help with a dental plan.","An ideal Pitsky diet should be formulated for a medium to large dog with high energy.As with all dogs, the Pitsky's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Pitsky's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.No two Pitskies are the same. They vary quite a bit in size. For their size Husky's don't require as much food as the Pit Bull. Feeding requirements will depend specifically on your pups size, activity level, and which parental traits prevail.","Pitsky coats are often a mix of their Siberian Husky, American Pit Bull parents' coats and colors. Pitskies typically come in white, black, brown, grey, brindle, and every combination and variation of the colors.They usually have short coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers, as their coats tend to shed less than average. There are longer-coated Pitskies, too, though they may not be as allergy friendly.This is a pretty sturdy breed and the Husky parentage means they would probably do well in a cold climate, but each it's so early in their development, you can't say for sure. These dogs, like all dogs, need to live indoors and be around their people.Huskys require much more grooming than Pit Bulls, so you will have to discuss grooming needs with your vet or groomer based on your pups individual coat and needs.","Pitskies make great pets for households with children. They can be very tolerant of kids, but like all other dogs, should be supervised when around youngsters.When no adult can be present to oversee what's going on, dogs should be crated or kenneled, especially after they reach sexual maturity, when they may begin to test the possibility of becoming ""pack leader.""Don't allow children to pull on a dog's ears or tail. Teach them never to approach any dog while they're sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away.Because of their American Pit Bull Terrier parents dog-fighting heritage, Pitskies may retain a tendency to be apprehensive or rough with other dogs, but if they are socialized early and trained to know what behavior is expected of them, any signs of aggression can be minimized or overcome, and many are dog- and cat-friendly.

They can be very dominant and should be socialized outside the home to avoid aggressive behavior.Plott Hounds must have training at an early age. They are generally eager to please but without training dominance and aggression problems can arise.Although they do well with older children who understand how to treat dogs, they are not recommended for homes with smaller children. They can become very possessive of food dishes and such. Even the best-trained or socialized dog should not be left alone with a young child.The Plott Hound is an uncommon breed and there may be long waiting lists for a puppy. If you do not wish to adopt an older dog, please be prepared to wait and do not go to irresponsible breeders for a shorter wait.Plott Hounds require at least an hour a day of walking or other exercise. They are not suited to living in apartments.Plott Hounds require weekly brushing as well as other regular grooming care, such as nail trimming and tooth brushing.Plott Hounds are not the best breed for an inexperienced or timid dog owner. Although they are very easy to train, they do have a dominant personality and will disregard an owner that is less sure of him or herself.Plott Hounds should have a fenced yard or be kept on leash since they have a tendency to wander off in pursuit of an interesting scent. They do not have any road sense and will wander into oncoming traffic if their path takes them there.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Male Plotts stand 20 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 50 to 75 pounds; females stand 20 to 25 inches and weigh 40 to 65 pounds.,"The Plott is described as bright, kind, confident, and courageous. He's loyal to his family and somewhat wary of strangers although he usually warms up quickly to them. He gets along all right with other dogs, but he's not as friendly toward them as many other hound breeds.You will often see a difference in temperament between Plotts bred for going after big game and those bred to tree raccoons, with the big game dogs having a sharper edge. Like every hound, the Plott has a mind of his own and requires firm, consistent guidance, but in general he wants to please his people. He's protective of his home and family and makes an excellent watchdog.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Plott Hounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Plott puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Plotts are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions.

Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Plotts, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Bloat is caused by the sudden influx of gas and air in the stomach. This causes the stomach to distend and twist and can cause death if it isn't treated.","Although Plott Hounds have moderately low energy indoors, they are active outside. If you don't have a several fenced acres that they can explore and sniff, expect to give them about an hour of exercise daily. You can break it up into two or three walks or playtimes. The Plott is a walking companion, not a jogger. He likes to meander along and sniff out interesting trails.Plott Hounds should remain on leash when they are not in an enclosed area and they should have a fenced yard when they are left outside. They will wander away, and they have no road sense. They'll follow an interesting trail right into the path of a car. While a Plott needs a fenced yard for safety, he's not a yard dog. When you're home, he should be there with you.Plott Hounds are fairly easy to train due to their intelligence and eager to please temperament. They do have a dominant streak and are not suggested for inexperienced or timid dog owners who are unable to consistently enforce rules and commands. They do well with positive reinforcement, and corrections should never be harsh or cruel. That will only make your Plott become stubborn or sulky.Plott Hounds must be socialized to prevent any aggression problems. Many obedience schools offer puppy socialization classes and this is a great start. Also remember to gradually expose your puppy to various stimuli within the community and in your home.Plotts can be possessive of their food dishes and will attack other dogs and animals that nose around their food. Teaching your Plott Hound to allow people to handle and remove his food dishes is an important training step that cannot be missed.Crate training your Plott Hound will assist in housetraining and protect your belongings from destruction. Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Plott doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Plott accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Plott in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Plotts are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.Leash training is a must for this breed with its tendency to wander and lack of road sense. With proper training, socialization, and consistent rules, you will find that the Plott Hound is not only a never-say-die hunting companion but also a wonderful foot warmer at night.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.If you're unsure whether your Plott is overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.Plotts are one of the breeds prone to gastric dilatation-volvulus, more commonly known as bloat. Feed them two or three times a day rather than once a day, and never let them exercise immediately after a meal.For more on feeding your Plott, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Plott Hound has a smooth coat with hair that ranges in texture from fine to medium coarse. The thick double coat provides plenty of protection against wet or cold weather, a necessity for a hunting dog bred in the mountains of North Carolina.Plott Hounds mostly come in any shade of brindle, which is a coat patterned with specks and streaks of light and dark markings. Brindles can be tan, chocolate, yellow, buckskin, chocolate, orange, gray, blue, liver, brown, and black. You might see a brindle with a black saddle or a black with brindle trim. They can also be solid black or an unusual color called buckskin, which comes in a range of shades: light cream, sandy red, yellow ochre, red fawn, dark fawn or golden tan. Whatever color a Plott is, you might occasionally see a little bit of white on the chest and feet.Plott Hounds are easy to groom. A good brushing once a week with a hound mitt — a nubbly glove that fits over your hand — or rubber curry brush will leave their coat gleaming. Plott Hounds don't shed excessively, but that weekly brushing will help keep dead hair off your clothes and furniture.Plott Hounds do not need frequent bathing and can be washed with a dry or foam shampoo. On the occasions when you do give a water bath, use a shampoo formulated for dogs to ensure that the natural oils aren't stripped from the coat.Because the Plott's floppy ears can block air circulation, they must be checked and cleaned weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian.Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Plott may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Plott's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Plott Hound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Plott to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Plott Hounds do well in homes with children, although they're best suited to living with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Plotts can be possessive of their food bowls, and this can pose a problem if a young child tries to snag a handful of kibble.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Plott Hounds can get along well with other dogs if they're introduced at a young age. If they raised with them, they can even learn to get along with cats, although they may tree cats they find outside.","We know of no Plott breed rescue groups.

Pocket Beagle,3,4,3,4,2,2,4,5,5,5,5,4,3,3,1,5,3,5,2,4,3,4,4,3,5,5,4,4,4,4,Hound Dogs,7 inches to 1 foot tall at the shoulder,7 to 15 pounds,Starts at 10 years,"Beagles can be difficult to housetrain. Some people say it can take up to a year to fully housetrain some Beagles. Crate-training is absolutely recommended.Beagles are very intelligent and can get bored if left alone too long. If left outside alone in a backyard, Beagles usually will start finding ways to amuse themselves, usually by howling, digging, or trying to find ways to get out and find some people or other dogs to play with.Be sure that you are prepared to work with your dog to control excessive barking and howling. The most common reason Beagles are turned over to rescue groups is because either their owners or their owners' neighbors got tired of their baying.Beagles are targets for thieves who would steal them and then perhaps sell them to research laboratories for use in experiments. Supervise your Beagle when he is outdoors and be sure to have him microchipped!Beagles are scenthounds and will wander off if they catch an enticing smell in the air. Their noses control their brains, and if they smell something interesting, nothing else exists in their world.Although loving and gentle, Beagles can have an independent, stubborn streak. Obedience training is recommended, but be sure the instructor of the class understands hound personality and favors using food as a reward (which few Beagles can resist).Do you remember how the famous cartoon Beagle Snoopy worried about his food bowl? Beagles are ""chow hounds"" and will overeat if given a chance. Monitor the amount of food you give them and be sure to keep your cupboards closed and your trashcans secured. Otherwise, your Beagle will sniff out the foods he likes the best.Teach children to respect your Beagle while he's eating, and not to approach or tease him with food. A Beagle takes his food bowl pretty seriously.Beagles are not good protection or guard dogs because they're usually friendly to everyone they meet.",Breeders of Pocket Beagles put their height at 7 to 12 inches and weight at 7 to 15 pounds.,"Beagles are gentle and sweet, smart and funny. They will make you laugh — that is when they're not making you cry because of their often naughty behavior. Beagle people spend a lot of time trying to outthink their dogs, and are often forced to resort to food rewards to lure their hounds into a state of temporary obedience.As with every dog, Beagles need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences. Socialization helps ensure that your pocket Beagle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","As with all dog breeds, the Beagle is prone to certain genetic or environmental diseases and conditions, and Pocket Beagles have more than most.While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Beagles, it is imperative to do your research to find a Beagle who's been bred with health in mind. A reputable breeder will be proud to discuss the steps she's taken to prevent health problems and to show you the following health certifications for a puppy's parents: Orthopedic Foundation for Animals clearances for hips, knees, heart, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old. So look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old. The following conditions are among those that may affect Pocket Beagles:Eye disorders including cherry eye, a common condition in which the gland of the third eyelid swells; glaucoma, an increase in the pressure of the fluid inside of the eye; cataracts, a clouded film over the eye lens; retinal dysplasia, a folding or displacement of the retina that can lead to blindness; and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells, which progresses to blindness. Beagles also can suffer from Distichiasis, an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye; and dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva. Contact your vet if you notice any redness, scarring, or excessive tearing.Epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes seizures, is fairly common in Beagles.Hypothyroidism, a dysfunction of the thyroid gland that causes weight gain, poor coat, reproductive problems and other issues, also is common in the breed.Beagle Dwarfism, which means the dog is smaller than normal. This condition may or may not be accompanied by other physical abnormalities, such as extremely short legs.Funny Puppy syndrome is a condition where a puppy is much smaller than its littermates and may require special feedings and treatments to survive. They often exhibit soreness in their feet and legs and may not be able to walk normally. Sometimes, these puppies grow up to be sickly dogs, but sometimes they show no signs of problems when mature.Chinese Beagle Syndrome (CBS) is a condition that is characterized by a wide skull and slanted eyes. The dog grows normally otherwise. Quite often, dogs with CBS have heart problems and toe abnormalities.Cleft Lip or Palate: The lip or palate isn't completely closed, causing the dog to have difficulty eating, drinking, and breathing.Cryptorchidism is the failure of one or both testicles to descend from the abdomen. When you have your dog neutered, your vet will be able to remove the undescended testicles, thereby helping your dog avoid health problems that might arise from this condition.Hermaphroditism, the presence of both male and female chromosomes and tissue.Canine Hip Dysplasia, an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness.Epiphyseal Dysplasia, characterized by abnormally slow growth in the rear legs; sometimes causes soreness.Intervertebral Disc DiseaseI (IDD): Ruptured discs in the spine cause pain and paralysis.Patellar luxation. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. Patellar luxation ranges from a minor annoyance that causes little pain to a cripping defect.","A pocket Beagle is every bit as much a scenthound as his larger brethren, which means that when outside he should always be on a leash in unconfined areas.He's a wanderer by nature, so in case he escapes — a common occurrence with Beagles — be sure he's microchipped and wearing I.D. tags so he can be returned to you.Some people prefer to use an underground electronic fence, but this type of enclosure doesn't prevent other animals from coming into your yard. Besides, if a scent is enticing enough your Beagle will be more than willing to risk a momentary shock to follow it.Like all dogs, Beagles benefit from obedience training. Positive reinforcement techniques work best because Beagles will simply tune out when treated harshly. Most Beagles are more than happy to do anything for a tasty treat.Adolescent Beagles are full of energy and need a lot of opportunities to work it all off. They love going for walks with their family, or, even better, a good run across a field to hunt down rabbits (not recommended unless you have adequately trained your dog to come back to you!).They can enjoy jogging with you, but wait until they are 18 months or older before starting them on such a repetitive exercise, or they could experience joint damage.When mature, a Beagle can become fairly lazy, content to lie about the house all day, and getting up mostly for meals and an occasional scratching of the ears. Since this is a breed is prone to obesity, it's not a good idea to let this happen.","Recommended daily amount: 7/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Beagles are food thieves. These dogs will raid your pantry and garbage daily if given the chance, and they're willing to eat until they pop.To keep his weight at a normal level, feed your Beagle at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he's putting on the pounds.He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they're buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your pocket Beagle will be just as happy to get a tiny-size training treat as a bigger biscuit.For more on feeding your Beagle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The breed standard for Beagles says any hound color is acceptable. Hound colors include all shades and combinations of white or cream, black, tan, lemon, red, brown, liver, blue, and gray.The most common color for Beagles is tricolor with a black saddle (the area across the back), white legs, chest, belly, and a white tip on the tail, and tan on the head and around the saddle. The second most common color combination is red and white in an Irish spotting pattern on the face, neck, legs, and tip of the tail.All colors can have freckling, mottling (dark roundish blotches on a lighter background), ticking (small, isolated areas of black hairs on a white background), and grizzling (a mixture of black or red and white hairs).Whatever their color, they typically have a white tip on their tails so hunters can see them when they're hunting in tall grass.Although you and I might think a Beagle has a short coat, it's actually classified as medium length. It's also smooth, dense, and resistant to rain.Beagles are clean dogs, unless, of course, they've found something appealingly stinky to roll in. Otherwise, they don't require frequent baths. They should be brushed with a medium-bristle brush or a hound glove (a rubber mitt with nubs on the palm area) at least once a week to loosen and remove dead hair and encourage new hair growth.Beagles shed, but because their hair is short, it usually isn't as noticeable as with other breeds. Their coats tend to get thicker in the winter, so they shed more in the spring.Since Beagles are drop-eared dogs, air doesn't circulate well inside their ears and they can get infections, so don't allow water or oils to enter his ears. Check their ears at least every two weeks for signs of infection or waxy buildup. Check them also if you notice your Beagle shaking his head a lot or scratching at his ears.You should check your Beagle's nails once a week and trim them if they are getting long.","Beagles bond with everyone in the family, especially children. They can be rambunctious when playing, however, so they need to be properly socialized and supervised with very young children.In addition, Beagles tend to be ""mouthy,"" grabbing things, like a child's hand, with their mouths. They are doing this in fun and can be taught not to do this.Pocket beagles are small and can be easily injured. Make it a rule that young children can hold them only while sitting on the floor. That helps ensure that the dog doesn't get dropped or carried around like a rag doll.It's also important never to leave dogs and young children together without supervision. They can hurt each other without meaning to.Because of their pack dog heritage, Beagles enjoy company and don't like to be left alone. Another dog or even a cat will help meet their companionship needs.","Pocket Beagles are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you're interested in adopting an adult Beagle who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage, a rescue group is a good place to start.Here are just a few of the many Beagle rescue groups in this country:The SOS Beagle RescueSafe Hounds Beagle Rescue, Inc.BONES: Beagles of New England States Rescue, Resource & ReferralBREW is Beagle Rescue, Education, and Welfare Beagles R Us Hound Rescue ",not available
Pointer,2,1,1,3,1,2,4,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,1,5,3,3,3,5,5,5,5,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,Sporting Dogs,"1 foot, 11 inches to 2 feet, 4 inches tall at the shoulder",45 to 75 pounds,12 to 15 years,"Pointers are very active and require vigorous exercise every day. If you do not have the time or energy to exercise your Pointer at least one hour each day, then you should not purchase a Pointer.Pointers can be very destructive when they are bored or don't get enough exercise, especially when young. This can result in chewing, digging, and many other negative behaviors that can lead to expensive vet bills and replacement costs.Pointers are wonderful family dogs who thrive when they can spend time with their people. A Pointer should not live outdoors but should enjoy the same comforts as his family.Although Pointers do very well with children, especially when raised with them, they are not best suited for homes with toddlers. They can be rambunctious as puppies and can unintentionally hurt small children by knocking them down or swiping them with that wagging tail.Pointers are not suited for apartment dwellings; they do much better in homes with a large fenced yard where they can expend some of their energy.Pointers generally do well with other dogs and other pets, especially if they're raised with them. They may, however, be very interested in pet birds, and the two should be protected from each other. You don't want your Pointer injured by a parrot's beak, and you don't want him trying to retrieve your parrot, canary or finch.Pointers are strong and energetic with a mind of their own. They're not a good choice for first-time dog owners or people who aren't strong enough to handle them and give them the exercise they need.Training is a must with this breed because he has a will of his own. Training can take time, but once the foundation is there, there is no limit to how far Pointers can go in various dog competitions.Pointers are average shedders and require only minimal grooming.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males stand 25 to 28 inches at the shoulder and weigh 55 to 75 pounds; females 23 to 26 inches and 45 to 65 pounds.,"Devoted and even-tempered, the Pointer is described as a congenial companion. He has a competitive spirit and an independent streak, but he's also fun-loving and mischievous. An excellent watchdog, he's protective of his property and will sound the alarm at anything out of the ordinary. In the field, he's hard-driving and courageous. In obedience trials he's willing and exuberant, performing the ""come"" command — known as the recall in the ring — as if shot out of a cannon.Pointers need early socialization and training. Like any dog, they can become timid if they are not properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Pointer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Pointers work well with people, but because of their hunting heritage — which often involves them working well away from the hunter — they can be independent, with a mind of their own. Pointers want to understand why you're asking them to do something and determine if it's a reasonable request before acting on any command. Train them with kindness and consistency, using positive reinforcements that include food rewards and praise. The Pointer who's treated harshly will simply become more stubborn and less willing to do your bidding. Your best bet is to keep training interesting. Pointers will develop selective hearing if there's something more exciting to pay attention to.The Pointer is an active dog who needs one to two hours of exercise daily. Exercising the Pointer's brain is equally important. It's important to remember that this breed is very intelligent. If he doesn't have something to do in the yard or house, he will make his own entertainment, and chances are it's not something that will please you. Leaving a Pointer alone for long periods of time without proper stimulation or exercise is a recipe for disaster, and you may find your home or yard destroyed when you return.Crate training is a wonderful way to prevent destructive behavior and housetraining accidents, but it won't work without the accompanying physical exercise and mental stimulation. Crate training should start at a young age and can aid in housetraining your Pointer. Pointers can be somewhat slow to housetrain, but with patience and consistency you'll be successful.When he gets the exercise and mental stimulation he needs, he's a quiet companion in the home who will be happy to share the couch with you. A tired Pointer is a happy, couch potato Pointer! In fact, if you have a rule about not letting animals on the furniture, you may want to reconsider getting a Pointer. He's quite sure that his place is right up there beside you, and it will be difficult to change his mind.","Pointers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pointers will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pointers, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as letting a puppy gain too much weight too quickly or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Epilepsy: Pointers can suffer from epilepsy, a disorder that causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Pointer has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.Neurotropic Osteopathy: This rare bone disease can occur between the ages of 3 to 9 months and is caused by abnormalities in the nerves. It can lead to the degeneration of the spine.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Cherry Eye: This condition occurs when the gland located in the dog's third eyelid (known as the nictitating membrane) bulges out. It looks like a reddened mass at the inner corner of the eye. Cherry eye can be repaired surgically.Entropion: This defect occurs when the lower eyelid folds inward, resulting in chronic irritation of the eye's surface. One or both eyes can be affected, and it's usually obvious by six months of age. If your Pointer has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can and should be corrected surgically.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye, which causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Chondrodysplasia: This genetic disorder that is commonly mislabeled as ""dwarfism."" Dogs with the deformity have abnormally short limbs for the breed. It ranges in severity from ""nearly normal"" to severe crippling. In less severe cases, dogs have lived full and healthy lives but a dog that is diagnosed with chondrodysplasia or screened as a carrier should not be bred so as not to pass on the genes for the condition.Addison's Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this extremely serious condition is caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison's disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and have little energy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it's easy to miss this disease as a diagnosis until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels become high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If your vet suspects Addison's, she may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.Demodectic Mange: All dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother dog passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can't be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother passes mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause any problems. If your Pointer has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, he can develop demodectic mange. Demodectic mange, also called demodicosis, can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It's thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. Even so, you should take your dog to the vet because it can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link.Skin cysts: Cysts are fluid-filled sacs found beneath the skin. There are many different types, and treatment varies for each individual case.","Pointers enjoy the great outdoors, and they enjoy being with their families. They should not live outside but instead should enjoy the same comforts as their families. They do well in active homes where hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities are enjoyed by all. They do need a large fenced yard where they can run. When they're given the exercise and training they need, they are quiet and mannerly house dogs.The Pointer is an active, intelligent dog who needs daily exercise and stimulation. He was developed to be a hunting dog who could work all day long, and his exercise needs don't change just because he's a family companion. Give him at least an hour of exercise per day and more if possible. A vigorous walk isn't enough. Take him running, teach him to run alongside your bicycle, play Frisbee in the backyard, or train him for agility, flyball, or other dog sports.A Pointer puppy is still growing and doesn't need the hard exercise that an adult can take. Let him play and nap on his own schedule throughout the day, and restrict jumping until he's reached his full growth at about 18 months of age. Jumping and running on hard surfaces at an early age can stress his joints and cause orthopedic problems.A fenced yard is essential. Pointers are bred to follow their nose and to run for long distances. They don't know about cars, and they don't know how to find their way back home after running for many miles. Many of the Pointers that end up with rescue groups are dogs that have obviously wandered off and were never found. Keep your Pointer inside a securely fenced yard or dog run for his safety and your peace of mind. Some Pointers have been known to do well with underground electronic fencing as long as training isn't rushed, but keep in mind that these fences don't keep out other animals or human intruders.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Pointer's physique sleek by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. Giving him plenty of daily exercise should do the rest. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the hands-on test. Place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine and the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs. If you can't feel the ribs, he needs a little less food and a lot more exercise.For more on feeding your Pointer, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","An old hunters' saying is that a good Pointer can't be a bad color. The Pointer has a striking coat of liver (dark brown), black, orange, or lemon, with or without a white background. Some Pointers have light or heavy speckles — called ticking — on the white areas of their coat. Tricolor Pointers (white, plus two other colors) exist but aren't very common. Dark-colored Pointers have a black or brown nose; light-colored dogs have a light or flesh-colored nose.The coat itself is short, smooth, and shiny. Give him a thorough brushing once a week with a hound mitt — a nubbly glove that fits over your hand — and he's good to go. He sheds only lightly, and the regular brushing will help keep hair off your clothes and furniture. Rub him with a chamois and his coat will gleam.In most cases, regular brushing and an occasional wipe down with a damp cloth or baby wipe will keep your Pointer clean, but he might need a bath three or four times a year. Use a shampoo made for dogs to keep the coat and skin from becoming dry, and be sure to rinse thoroughly to prevent itchiness from shampoo residue.Begin accustoming your Pointer to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a damp cotton ball. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Brush your Pointer's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Pointer enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. They also prevent toe injuries from occurring when your Pointer is running — something he'll do frequently.","Pointers are usually good with children and other animals, particularly if they are raised with them. Teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Pointers can also get along well with other pets, including cats, if they're raised with them, although they may be a little too fond of birds, if you know what I mean.","Pointers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Pointers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Pointer rescue.Pointer Rescue",not available

Don't give in when he gives you that pathetic, hungry look. Since he won't monitor his food intake, you have to: feed him only the amounts appropriate for his size and age, and remember that snacks and treats count.That cute, shaggy PON puppy can easily fool you into thinking he's an amenable dog who'll follow your every whim. Not so — the PON has a very strong personality, even as a youngster. He thinks for himself. That's certainly a good trait for a working dog, but it also means his owner must be firm, fair, and persistent. In other words, you have to be the boss.The PON adores his family, but he's aloof and suspicious toward strangers. Don't expect him to greet your dinner guests with a friendly look and a wagging tail. Proper socialization is essential to encourage the PON to be comfortable with a variety of people, so get him out and about among friendly strangers from the very beginning. Puppy classes are an excellent idea.While he isn't hyperactive, the PON does have a lot of energy and stamina. If he doesn't get enough mental and physical stimulation, he'll get bored (don't we all), which can lead to excessive barking, chewing, or digging. To prevent problem behaviors, keep the PON busy with activities and don't leave him alone for long periods of time.While the PON's shaggy coat is adorable, let's face it: it does require a great deal of grooming. If that's not for you, or if you can't delegate the job to another willing family member, consider a different breed.To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments",Males and females stand 17 to 20 inches tall and weigh 35 to 55 pounds.,"The PON is a highly intelligent, hardworking dog. He is known for his ability to remember what he learns — both good and bad habits. He is strong willed and can be stubborn, so he needs an owner who will kindly and consistently provide leadership. Otherwise, he will try to rule the roost.Because of his working heritage, the PON likes to be busy, physically and mentally. He needs activities to challenge him: hiking, herding, agility, tracking, and advanced obedience training are all good bets. If he isn't provided proper outlets for his energy, he is likely to express himself through more annoying amusements such as barking, digging, and chewing.The PON doesn't make friends with just anyone. He is most comfortable with his family and is suspicious of people he doesn't know.","PONs are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain conditions and diseases.Canine hip dysplasia is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is actually a family of eye diseases involving the gradual deterioration of the retina. In the early stages of the disease, dogs become night blind; eventually they lose their daytime vision as well.","The Polish Lowland Sheepdog prefers a cooler climate, but he can adapt to warmer temperatures as long as he has adequate, cool shelter. Although the PON is ideally suited for rural life, he does well in apartments and houses without backyards as long as he has a job to do and is taken outside frequently for exercise. If he isn't herding a flock on a farm, he appreciates the challenge of obedience, agility, or herding competitions, or even just hiking and jogging with you.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.The PON benefits from two meals a day rather than one — and don't leave food out for him all the time. He's known for his hearty appetite and will overeat if he can. If you're unsure whether there's too much fat under all that fur (it's hard to tell by simply looking), give him the hands-on test by placing your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel (but not see) his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your PON, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The shaggy PON has a long, dense topcoat and a soft, thick undercoat. The coat comes in many colors; the most common are white with black, gray, or sandy patches; or gray with white or chocolate. Occasionally, a PON isall white, all black, or black and tan. Most PONs are born with a darker puppy coat than they will have as adults, with the exception of puppies born white. The PON is considered a nonshedding breed.When it comes to grooming the PON, the natural look is in. That doesn't mean the breed doesn't need grooming — in fact, that shaggy coat needs a lot of grooming to keep it free of tangles, though no trimming is necessary or even recommended. Breed enthusiasts stress the importance of not primping the PON.Plan on brushing and combing thoroughly at least twice a week, and always before bathing (detangling spray is helpful). A bath every two months may be necessary. Like all dogs with fluffy coats, the PON gets dirty easily, so you're in for muddy paws, leaves or burrs tracked into the house, feces on the hindquarters, or a wet and dirty beard.Trim your PON's nails once a month, and check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Wipe them out weekly (and after bathing or any other time the PON gets wet) with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.The PON coat can be too much for an inexperienced owner to handle, so you consider having a professional groomer help with the upkeep. That won't let you completely off the hook, though. You'll still need to brush that coat thoroughly between professional grooming sessions. If you aren't crazy about combing and brushing — no doubt about it, it's a lot of work — you may want to consider another breed.","Your PON will be your devoted, lifelong friend. His loyal nature makes him a loving companion for an individual or family — he'll consider the family his flock. He gets along with children and other animals best if he's raised with them. Because he is naturally wary of outsiders (a good trait for a herding/guard dog), the PON is most likely to accept as part of his flock those he knows from puppyhood. He is likely to remain aloof with those he doesn't know, though he can warm up to family friends and pets with exposure and positive interaction.","Polish Lowland Sheepdogs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many PONs in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a PON rescue.Rescue and Adoption Service for the Polish Lowland Sheepdog",not available

Crate training is recommended.High heat and humidity can cause your Pom to become overheated and possibly have heat stroke. When your Pom is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating and take him inside immediately. They definitely are housedogs and should not be kept outdoors.While Poms are good with children, they are not a good choice for very young or highly active children because of their small size. Never let your small children and your Pom play without supervision.Because they are so small, Poms can be perceived as prey by owls, eagles, hawks, coyotes, and other wild animals. Never leave them outside unattended, and be watchful if there are predatory birds in your location. If this is the case, stay close to your Pom to discourage birds from trying to carry them off!Because they are small and attractive, Poms are targets for dognappers, another reason why you shouldn't leave them outside unattended, even in a fenced yard.Although they are small, Poms don't seem to realize it and can have a ""big dog"" attitude. This can spell disaster if they decide to chase a bigger dog that they think is encroaching upon their territory, or if they jump from a high place. It's up to you to make sure that your little one doesn't harm himself due to not realizing his limitations.When your Pom gets old, he may develop bald spots in his beautiful coat.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Pomeranians are 7 to 12 inches tall and weigh 3 to 7 pounds. Some litters have puppies that are throwbacks to the days when they were larger and grow to be 12 to 14 pounds or more. These puppies can be an excellent choice for families with children.,"The extroverted Pomeranian is smart and vivacious. He loves meeting new people and gets along well with other animals, although he sometimes thinks he's a lot bigger than he is. Don't let him challenge bigger dogs in his mistaken belief that he's their size or larger.Alert and inquisitive, Pomeranians make excellent watchdogs and will bark at anything out of the ordinary. Teach them to stop barking on command, though, or they might go on all day long.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy who's willing to sit nicely on your lap, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Aggression and shyness aren't characteristics that your Pom puppy will outgrow.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up. They should be friendly, calm, quiet, and easy to live with.Like every dog, Pomeranians need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pom puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Pomeranians are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Poms will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Poms, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Allergies: Some Pomeranians can suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact allergies to food allergies. If your Pomeranian is licking his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, suspect that he has an allergy and have him checked by your vet.Epilepsy: Some Pomeranians develop epilepsy and have seizures. If your Pom has seizures, take him to the vet to determine what treatment is appropriate.Eye Problems: Pomeranians are prone to a variety of eye problems, including cataracts, dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) (dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva), and tear duct problems. These problems can appear in young adult dogs and may lead to blindness if untreated. Contact your vet if you notice any redness, scarring, or excessive tearing.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia occurs occasionally in Pomeranians. Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Pomeranians usually are able to lead normal, healthy lives, unlike some of the large and giant breeds, who require surgery to get around easily.Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Pomeranian has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The first signs are limping and atrophy of the leg muscle. Qualified vets can perform a surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn't attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a ""false joint"" and the puppy is usually pain free.Patellar Luxation: This is a very common problem for Poms. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Collapsed Trachea: This is a condition in which the trachea, which carries air to the lungs, tends to collapse easily. The most common sign of a collapsed trachea is a chronic, dry, harsh cough that many describe as being similar to a ""goose honk."" Since it can be caused by pulling too hard against a collar while walking, you should train your Pom to walk nicely beside you instead of pulling at the leash, or use a harness instead of a collar. Collapsed trachea can be treated medically or surgically.Dental Problems: Poms are prone to teeth and gum problems and early tooth loss. Watch for dental problems and take your Pom to the vet for regular dental exams.","Pomeranians are very active indoors and are good choices for apartment dwellers and people without a fenced yard. They have a moderate activity level and will enjoy several short daily walks or play times.They are remarkably hearty and enjoy longer walks, but always keep in mind that they are small and sensitive to heat. They love to play and can get bored easily, so be sure to give them lots of toys and rotate them frequently so there's always something new. They especially enjoy toys that challenge them.One activity that both you and your Pom will enjoy is trick training. Poms love to learn new things and enjoy being the center of attention, so teaching them tricks is a perfect way to bond with them while providing them with exercise and mental stimulation.They have a short attention span, so keep training sessions brief and fun. Reward your Pom with praise, treats, or play whenever he correctly performs a command or does something else you like.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Pom, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Pomeranian's glory is his thick, stand-out, double coat with an undercoat of soft, thick, fluffy hair and a top coat of long, straight, shiny hair that's harsh to the touch. The longer hair around the neck and chest forms a frill, enhancing the Pom's proud appearance.The Pom's tail is another outstanding characteristic of the breed. The plumed tail with its profusion of hair lies flat, fanning out upon the dog's back. Interestingly, when Poms are born, their tails don't look like this. It may take months for the tail to develop this way.One of the great things about Pomeranians is that they come in any color or pattern you can imagine in dogs, including black, black and tan, blue, blue and tan, chocolate, chocolate and tan, cream, cream sable, orange, orange sable, red, red sable, sable (black-tipped hairs on a background of silver, gold, gray, fawn, or brown), brindle (a base color of gold, red, or orange with strong black cross stripes), and white. Poms that are white with patches of any other color are called ""parti-colored.""Poms are considered to shed moderately. Males typically shed their undercoats once a year. Unspayed females often shed their undercoats when they are in season, after they deliver a litter, and whenever they're stressed.To keep hair off your clothes and furniture, brush and comb your Pom at least twice weekly with a wire slicker brush and metal comb. This distributes the skin's natural oils, keeps the coat and skin healthy, and prevent mats or tangles. Be sure you brush and comb all the way down to the skin to remove all the shedding undercoat.Start brushing your Pom at his head, and then part the coat and brush it forward so it falls back in place when you are finished. If you want, you can trim your Pom occasionally for neatness, especially on the feet, around the face and ears, and around the rear end.You can bathe him as often as you like, whether that's daily or monthly, as long as you use a mild dog shampoo and conditioner. If he starts to smell a little doggy between baths, sprinkle some baby powder on his coat, let it sit a few minutes, and then brush it out.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Poms are prone to dental problems, so this is something that you must be especially watchful for. It's a good idea to brush their teeth at least once a week, and even better, daily.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Pom enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Pomeranian to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The bold and active Pomeranian loves to play, but he's best suited to a home with older children who can be trusted to handle him carefully. Many breeders refuse to sell puppies to homes with very young children, for good reason. Sturdy though he is, the diminutive Pom is all too easily injured if he's accidentally dropped or stepped on by a clumsy child.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Pomeranians can get along great with cats and other animals, especially if they're raised with them. Protect them from bigger dogs. Poms don't realize just how small they are, and they have no fear of challenging bigger dogs.","Pomeranians are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Poms in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Pom rescue.New England Pomeranian Rescue, CTNorthwater Pom Haven, NYNW Pomeranian Rescue, Portland ORNorthwater Rescue, Norwood, NYPonderosa Pomeranian Rescue",not available

There is some variation in size, as breed standards haven't been firmly established, but it's fairly safe to assume that a Pomsky won't be much heavier than 38 pounds at most when it is full-grown, and that's on the higher end of Pomsky weight.","The Pomsky is a bit of a comedian and tends to know that its cute antics will be met with plenty of adoration from human onlookers. They are highly adaptable to change, and their moderate exercise needs make them fairly suited to apartment living, so long as they get at least one long walk per day. That said, they tend to inherit their Husky parents' chatty howling and whining tendencies along with their Pomeranian parents' penchant for yapping. This makes them very vocal dogs that may get on the neighbors' nerves. Also, they shed a ton, so be prepared to find hair everywhere and have some lint rollers and a vacuum cleaner at the ready.Pomskies tend to latch on to one favorite family member, though they may get along with all humans in the household. Socialization is very important and should begin at an early age. Pomskies can be nervous around strangers if they haven't been properly socialized.","Pomskies can develop the common health problems of both its Husky and Pomeranian parents. They are genetically predisposed to conditions like allergies, hip dysplasia, dislocated knees (luxating patellas), eye problems, epilepsy, heart disease, collapsing trachea, and skin problems among other issues. They are also especially prone to dental issues, so it is important to keep up with regular teeth cleanings.","Pomskies have moderate exercise needs that should be satisfied with at least one good walk per day. They can have high energy, and may need some extra play sessions before they relax.Their thick coat makes Pomskies suitable to cold weather, so be prepared to bundle up and take them outdoors all year long. They also do well with toys that stimulate them mentally, as Pomskies are intelligent dogs that may become bored if they aren't challenged.Training can be tough, as some Pomskies inherit stubbornness from the Siberian Husky, but they should be fine with learning new things if you provide them with food motivators and plenty of praise.","Pomskies are high energy dogs and require a diet that will meet their needs. Because breed standards haven't been established, it is difficult to say for sure what individual dogs will need to eat. It is best to ask your veterinarian or a pet nutritionist about your specific dog's nutritional requirements. Typically, they'll need a diet suitable for a small to mid-sized dog.","Pomskies have a soft, fluffy double coat that requires lots of brushing to maintain. The thick coat keeps them very comfortable in cold temperatures. Pomskies tend to shed a lot, and although brushing helps, you can still expect to find hair around the home. Coat colors vary, much like the breed's Pomeranian and Husky parents. They come in grey and white, brown or reddish brown, blue, pure white, and more. Nails should be trimmed every few weeks and teeth should be brushed daily, as the breed is prone to dental problems.","Pomskies are often wary of small children who may not be properly trained on how to handle animals, and they can nip if they feel uncomfortable or threatened. They can get along with other dogs if they are socialized, especially if they have been raised with them, though the high prey drive they inherit from the Husky means they might like to give chase to smaller animals like cats. It is best to socialize them early, especially if you plan to have them in a household with children or other pets.","You should always consider rescue or adoption from shelters, as buying from breeders only encourages overpopulation and leaves shelter dogs without homes. There are several rescue groups all over the country that specifically help Pomeranians, Siberian Huskies, and mixes of those breeds, including Pomskies. You can also search our database of adoptable dogs for specific breeds and find dogs near you.

Be prepared for people you see on walks to stop and ask to pet your dog.","As the Poochon is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Toy Poodle and Bichon Frise parents, you can expect Poochon to be on the small side.Most weigh in at six to 17 pounds and range in height from nine to 15 inches at the shoulder. Of course with mixed breeds, many can be smaller or larger.","Cuddly and playful, Poochons enjoy napping on the couch, but also need walks during the day with plenty of active play sessions sprinkled in. If you like playing games with your dog, this may be the one for you.Poochons are smart, playful, and natural charmers. When you go on outings with your dog, you may want to allow for extra time because you will most likely be stopped in the street by kids and adults asking if they can pet your dog.Poochons, can be extremely vocal or barky, but this trait can be minimized with lots of stimulation, such as indoor play sessions, games, and outdoor walks. Early training also helps curb unwanted behaviors.The Poochon has a strong social nature. They enjoy being around people and other pets and would be a great addition to multiple pet households.While playful with people and animals, Poochons are typically very affectionate with their own family members. They would also do well in an active, single person household. Just make sure that you have the time and attention to give to this little floofer.","The Poochon breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Toy Poodle and Bichon Frise also face.

Make sure your dog gets frequent walks and play sessions through out the day.If you keep a hanky near by to wipe their eyes when they get moist, it can help minimize the tear stains that their breed is prone to getting. Multiple dogs sometimes clean each others eyes, but dogs typically do not clean their own eyes.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking loudly against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.A major concern when it comes to your Poochon's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Poochon diet should be formulated for a small breed with moderate to high energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day.As with all dogs, the Poochon's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Poochon's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Poochon coats are often a mix of their Poodle and Bichon parents' coat. The main colors of Poochons are cream, tan, and apricot. Usually their coats are solid, and sometimes they have blend of colors. Less common colors are black or grey.Their coats are usually medium in length and don't shed much, which makes them a great choice for allergy sufferers.Both parent breeds are high maintenance when it comes to grooming, and you can expect the same from the Poochon. These pups will most likely require daily brushing along with shampooing every few weeks with a mild product and monthly grooming. Grooming should be factored into cost of living with this mixed breed dog--it's non-negotiable.Poochons are prone to tear stains. If you decide to adopt a Poochon, keep a cloth tissue on hand to dab their eyes regularly. It helps manage the tear staining quite a bit.","Poochons adore kids and families and the endless noise and commotion that comes with them. However, because the Poochon is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.

This is especially common among the smaller varieties — Miniature and Toy Poodles — who are more likely to be coddled and untrained. Teach your dog good canine manners, and then insist that he use them; it shows him that you're the leader of the pack.Because of their intelligence and playful nature, obedience training is essential to keep your Poodle's mind active. A Poodle who is thinking and learning isn't bored, and therefore won't find destructive ways to occupy himself.The Poodle coat needs a lot of upkeep to stay beautiful and healthy. Most Poodle owners take their dogs to a professional groomer every three to six weeks. If you want to save money on grooming expenses, you can learn to do it yourself, but it takes time and effort.Poodles have weepy eyes that can stain the surrounding hair. To cut down on stains, gently wipe down the face daily with an alcohol-free pet wipe or washcloth dipped in warm water.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","There are three sizes of Poodle: toy, miniature, and standard. These aren't different breeds, just different sizes of the same dog. The Toy Poodle stands up to 10 inches tall, and weighs about six to nine pounds. The Miniature Poodle stands 11 to 15 inches tall and weighs 15 to 17 pounds. The Standard Poodle stands 15 inches and taller (usually 22 inches); males weigh 45 to 70 pounds and females weigh 45 to 60 pounds.","Intelligent, loving, loyal, and mischievous are four words Poodle enthusiasts commonly use to describe the breed's personality. The Poodle is also known for what his fans call ""an air of distinction"": a dignified attitude that's hard to describe, but easy to spot in the dog.Despite his regal appearance, the Poodle has a goofy streak and loves to play — he's always up for a game of any kind. He's also very fond of people and eager to please. Combine that with his legendary intelligence, and you've got a dog that's highly trainable.A good Poodle who's been taught canine manners has a calm disposition, especially if he gets regular exercise to burn off his natural energy. Some owners and breeders think the smaller Toy and Miniature Poodles are a bit more high-strung than the Standard; however, other breeders and owners disagree with this theory.The Poodle is protective of his home and family, and if strangers approach your house, he'll sound a warning bark to let you know. And although he's affectionate with his family, he may take a while to warm up to new people.An outstanding trait of the Poodle is his intelligence. He is often said to have human-like intelligence, an amazing cleverness that astounds his owners. Of course, smart dogs can be difficult to live with. They learn fast — good habits and bad — and they remember everything.","Poodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Poodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Poodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Addison's Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this extremely serious condition is caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison's disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and lethargy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it's easy to miss this disease as a diagnosis until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels get high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If Addison's is suspected, your vet may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus: Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs like Poodles, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Cushings Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism): This condition occurs when the body produces too much cortisol. It can be due to an imbalance of the pituitary or adrenal gland, or it can occur when a dog has too much cortisol resulting from other conditions. Common signs are excessive drinking and urination. If your Poodle exhibits these two symptoms, take it to the veterinarian. There are treatments to help with this disease, including surgery and medication.Epilepsy: A common cause of seizures in all varieties of Poodles is idiopathic epilepsy. It often is inherited and can cause mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more. Therefore, if your Poodle has seizures, it's important to take him to the vet right away for a checkup.Hip Dysplasia: When the hip socket is poorly formed or the ligaments are loose enough to allow the ball of the thigh bone (femur) to slide part of the way out of the hip socket, it's called dysplastic. Canine hip dysplasia is inherited, with environmental factors sometimes playing a large part in its development. Over time, there is degeneration of the joint that can cause arthritis and pain, even lameness. Excess weight, excessive or prolonged exercise before maturity, a fast growth rate, and high-calorie or supplemented diets can contribute to the development of canine hip dysplasia. Veterinary care includes nutritional supplements, medication and, in some cases, surgery.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by is an under active thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma and other skin conditions.Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Poodle has Legg-perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn't attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free.Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose sight during the day. Many affected dogs adapt to their limited or loss of vision very well, as long as the surroundings remain the same.Optic Nerve Hypoplasia: This condition is a congenital failure if development of the optic nerve. It causes blindness and abnormal pupil response in the affected eye.Sebaceous Adenitis (SA): SA is a serious problem in Poodles, especially Standards. It's estimated that 50 percent of all Standard Poodles are carriers, or affected. This genetic condition is difficult to diagnose and often is mistaken for hypothyroidism, allergies, or other conditions. When a dog has SA, the sebaceous glands in the skin become inflamed for unknown reasons, and are eventually destroyed. These glands typically produce sebum, a fatty secretion that aids in preventing drying of the skin. It's usually first noticed when the dog is from 1 to 5 years old. Affected dogs typically have dry, scaly skin with hair loss on top of the head, neck, and back. Severely affected dogs can have thickened skin and an unpleasant odor, along with secondary skin infections. Although the problem is primarily cosmetic, it can be uncomfortable for the dog. Your vet will perform a biopsy of the skin if SA is suspected. Treatment options vary.Von Willebrand's Disease: This is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood's ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand's disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.","Poodles do just fine in any type of home, from apartments to estates, so long as they have regular exercise and plenty of human companionship. They prefer to live indoors with the family, particularly the smaller Toy and Miniature Poodles, since they have no trouble getting their ya-yas out in the house. This intelligent breed learns quickly, but owners should be careful: It's as easy to accidentally teach your Poodle bad habits as it is to teach him good ones, so if you're new to dogs, sign up for an obedience class with a skilled trainer. That goes for Toy and Miniature Poodles as well. Many owners of small dogs skip training, and wind up with a badly behaved dog.","Recommended daily amount: Standards, 1.5 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals; Miniatures, 3/4 to 1 cup; Toys, 1/4 to 1/2 cup.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Like any breed, the poodle will pack on weight if he's overfed, which can cause joint problems and other health woes. Limit treats, keep him active, and feed in meals rather than leaving food available at all times. Although many owners of Miniature or Toy Poodles in particular give their dogs table scraps, resist those pleading eyes — you'll create a finicky eater. He'll turn up his nose at dog food, which is healthier for him.Keep your Poodle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Poodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Poodle is a non-shedding breed, and a good choice for people with allergies. Many allergic people are able to keep a Poodle with no reaction.The coat comes in many colors, including blue, black, white, gray, silver, brown, café-au-lait, apricot, and cream. The hair is curly, wiry, and dense, and this unique texture can be trimmed, clipped, groomed, shaved, and otherwise manipulated into all kinds of fanciful shapes. If your dog is going to compete in the show ring, however, you can't go too wild with the styling; the American Kennel Club allows four specific clip styles for Poodles in conformation competitions.Grooming a Poodle isn't for the faint of heart. Poodles are high-maintenance dogs. He requires regular grooming, every three to six weeks, sometimes more often, to keep the coat in good condition. If you are considering a Poodle, consider the upkeep of the coat and expense of grooming.Don't be scared, though. There are many ways to style the coat for easier care. In fact, many owners simply shave it off.That said, easy care doesn't mean without care. Even when clipped short, your Poodle will need to be brushed, bathed, and trimmed every three to six weeks, sometimes more often, to keep the coat clean, short, and tangle free.Most owners pay a professional groomer, but if you're dedicated and have the time, you can learn to groom your Poodle yourself. You'll need a good set of electric clippers and blades, a quality pair of scissors, brush, comb, toenail trimmer, and a good how-to grooming book or video — there are many on the market just for Poodle owners.Even if you let a professional handle the complicated stuff, your Poodle needs daily brushing. Because Poodles don't shed like other breeds, loose hair collects in the coats, and unless it's brushed out daily, the hair will mat very quickly.Many Poodles have weepy eyes that stain the hair under their eyes. The lighter your dog's coat, the more noticeable the tearstains. To cut down on staining, wipe around the eyes and face every day with an alcohol-free pet wipe or washcloth dampened with warm water.Be sure to check your Poodle's ears often every week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection, then wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Breeds with drop-down ears are prone to ear infections because the ear canal stays dark and moist. Also, hair grows in the Poodle's ear canal. Sometimes, this hair needs to be plucked. Ask your groomer or veterinarian if it's necessary for your dog.Brush your Poodle's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Poodle enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Poodle to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Poodle is a wonderful companion for kids, although young kids who don't know how to handle a dog could accidentally hurt a Toy Poodle, the smallest and most delicate variety of the breed.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Poodles who grow up with other dogs or pets in the house — or who have plenty of opportunities to interact with them in group training classes, dog parks, and the like — will enjoy their company. If your Poodle is used to being the only pet in the household, however, he may need some time and special training to help him accept a newcomer.","Poodles are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Poodles in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

Some will be black or brown with some possible markings among their coat.There are two varieties of coat types for these pooches, the smooth and the wiry coat. The smooth coat is short and very dense while the harsh wiry coat is longer. Both are fairly easy to groom.Portuguese Podengo Pequenos will need one good hour of walking per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in if possible.These pups are highly intelligent and willing to please, which makes them fairly easy to train.Portuguese Podengo Pequenos can be yappy and will alert you to intruders. You can curb unwanted barking tendencies with training.Dogs of this breed can handle living in apartments, but with their energy, they are best suited for homes with yards where they can run around.","The Portuguese Podengo is classified into three classes based on their size: large (grande), medium (medio) and small (pequeno). For the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno, you can expect a small sized pup. Most weigh in at nine to 13 pounds and range in height from eight to twelve inches at the shoulder. That said, many can be slightly smaller or larger.","The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno are a lively bunch who love to please their pet parents. They are highly active and don’t like to lay on the couch for too long. They are adept and love playing games especially outside in a yard or park.These pups are highly intelligent and willing to please, which makes them fairly easy to train. They are not overly aggressive, but they are not shy, either. If they feel threatened by a stranger, they will surely bark.These pooches have a strong prey drive, as they were bred to be hunters. They are good at being companion dogs and watchdogs as well. They can be a bit yappy at times and need to be on a leash if they are not properly trained, as their hunting instincts will take over, and they might want to wander off.The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is a friendly breed that can get along in any type of household. From single people to large families with children of all ages, these pups love to please their pet parents. They can handle living in apartments, but with their energy, they are best suited for homes with yards where they can run around.","The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno dog breed is predisposed to the same conditions as most in the Portuguese Podengo breed classes, regardless of size. Most are generally healthy with minimal health issues. Regardless, be sure to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Portuguese Podengo Pequeno’s suffer from include:hip dysplasiaeye disorderspatellar luxation","As with all dog breeds, you should keep up with your Portuguese Podengo Pequeno's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your pup healthy.The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno high energy and active lifestyle will prevent them from gaining too much weight. Nevertheless, make sure your dog gets at least one good hour of walking per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in if possible.Check their ears and eyes for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long—usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Portuguese Podengo Pequeno's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Portuguese Podengo Pequeno diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. If you overfeed them with no exercise, these pups will likely gain weight, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their number of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Portuguese Podengo Pequeno's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs—including weight, energy, and health—to make a specific recommendation.","Portuguese Podengo Pequeno coats are often light, medium, or dark yellow or fawn. Some will be black or brown with some possible markings among their coat.There are two varieties of coat types for these pooches, the smooth and the harsh, wiry coat. The smooth coat is short and very dense while the harsh wiry coat is longer. There is no undercoat which makes grooming relatively easy. Brushing them at least once a week will be fine for these tiny pups.Because they tend to have shorter coats, Portuguese Podengo Pequenos aren't particularly fond of extreme weather. They do tend to prefer sunny weather over cold climates.","Because the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is a small dog, they can easily be injured by overly excited children. Portuguese Podengo Pequenos are able to get along with adults and children of all ages. That said, it is best if younger children learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, as they can make great companions and watchdogs.When it comes to other pets, the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It’s best if they get used to other pets early.Many of this breed type get along just fine with virtually everyone, other dogs and cats included, but it comes down to training, socialization, and the luck of the draw at times.","Because the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is a somewhat rare breed, it may be difficult to find a breed-specific rescue.

They love swimming and make excellent jogging companions.Without proper exercise and mental stimulation, Portuguese Water Dogs can become destructive. They especially like to chew.Portuguese Water Dogs are highly intelligent. They love learning new things, but they can also become bored easily, so make training challenging and fun.Portuguese Water Dogs get along well with children and other family pets, especially if they're raised with them. They can be reserved toward strangers, but are never lacking in love and affection for their families.Portuguese Water Dogs don't shed much and are often considered hypoallergenic. Keep in mind that all dogs shed hair and dander to some degree, and no dog is completely hypoallergenic. If you have pet allergies, the best way to see if you'll have a reaction to a particular dog is to spend time with him and watch for symptoms.Portuguese Water Dogs love people and should live in the home with their family.They can adapt to apartment life if they get enough exercise.Portuguese Water Dogs tend to mature more slowly than other breeds.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.","Male Portuguese Water Dogs stand 20 to 23 inches at the shoulder, and weigh 42 to 60 pounds. Females stand 17 to 21 inches, and weigh 35 to 50 pounds.","The Portuguese Water Dog has a lot of great qualities: he's tireless, and fun loving, with a great sense of humor. He's also smart enough that he can out think you if you don't stay a step ahead of him. You may frequently find yourself laughing as he plays the clown to get your attention.You'll find a range of temperaments in Portuguese Water Dogs. Some are strong-willed, some are laid back, and most fall somewhere in the middle.As with all dogs, Portuguese Water Dogs need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Portie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Portuguese Water Dogs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Porties will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Juvenile Dilated Cardiomyopathy is an inherited disease that causes sudden death in puppies between the ages of five weeks and seven months. At this time, there is no cure and no way to determine if a puppy will be affected with the disease. The only way for breeders to prevent producing affected puppies is to avoid breeding carriers of the gene.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Storage Disease (GM1) is a recessive genetic disorder caused by a lack of an enzyme and allows the buildup of toxic substances in the nerve cells. It is fatal to puppies produced by two carriers. A DNA test has been developed to determine whether dogs are normal or carriers. This has dramatically reduced the incidence of both carriers and affected puppies.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Portuguese Water Dogs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal, an Optigen rating for progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and a DNA test for GM1 (storage disease).Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","Porties are people lovers and they should live in the home, not outside. Ideally, they'll have a fenced yard where they can play safely — although with enough exercise, they can adapt to apartment life.A Portie needs 30 minutes to an hour of exercise daily: long walks, jogging or swimming, or games of fetch. With enough exercise, he's a quiet companion indoors. Without it, well, you may come home to find your belongings chewed to bits.Train your Portuguese Water Dog using positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Avoid endless repetition or he'll get bored.This is a dog who learns quickly and enjoys mastering new skills. Training your Portuguese Water Dog for obedience, agility, tracking, or water work is a great way to stimulate his mind and give him the activity he enjoys. He can also make a wonderful therapy dog. If nothing else, you can teach him tricks to amaze the neighbors.Any type of training will help you build a special bond with your Portie. Give him a job to do and he'll be thrilled.Be aware that the Portuguese Water Dog likes to chew. Provide him with plenty of chew toys, rotate them regularly so he doesn't get bored, and teach him early what's okay to chew and what's not.","Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Portuguese Water Dog in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Portie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Portuguese Water Dog has two coat types: curly and wavy. Both types are a single coat, meaning there's no undercoat. That's why the Portie doesn't shed as much as some breeds and why he's often considered to be hypoallergenic. (Although all dogs shed hair and dander to some degree — there's no such thing as a truly hypoallergenic dog.)The Portie's coat can be black, white, various shades of brown, or black or brown with white. It's popular to give the Portie a lion clip or a retriever clip. In the lion clip, the muzzle, mid-body, and rear end are short, with a tuft at the end of the tail. In the retriever clip, the coat is clipped or trimmed all over to about an inch in length, following the outline of the body.Brush or comb your Portie two or three times a week to keep the coat tangle-free. Clip or trim the coat monthly to keep it looking neat.With any dog who spends a lot of time in the water, it's important to give a thorough fresh-water rinse after swimming to remove chemicals, salt, and other substances that can cause coat or skin problems. Wipe out and dry the ears thoroughly as well to prevent infections.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Portie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Dental hygiene is also important. Brush your Portie's teeth at least two or three times a week to keep his breath fresh and prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease. Daily brushing is even better.Start grooming your Portie when he's a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Portuguese Water Dogs make excellent family companions, especially when raised with kids. They can be rambunctious, however, which is often scary or overwhelming for young children.Always teach children how to safely approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young kids to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling from either party.Porties get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they're raised with them. As with all dogs, you should keep an eye on Porties around small pets such as rabbits, guinea pigs, and hamsters.",Consider adopting a Portuguese Water Dog before going to a breeder.Portuguese Water Dog Club of America Rescue,not available

Crate training is recommended.Pugs can't tolerate high heat and humidity because of a short muzzle (air cools down when it passes through the noses of dogs with longer muzzles before entering the lungs). When your Pug is outdoors, watch him carefully for signs of overheating. Pugs are definitely housedogs and should not be kept outdoors.Despite their short coats, Pugs shed a lot.Pugs wheeze, snort and snore, loudly.Because their eyes are so prominent, Pugs are prone to eye injuries.Pugs are greedy eaters and will overeat if given the chance. Since they gain weight easily, they can quickly become obese if food intake isn't monitored carefully.Pugs need human constant human companion. If you own a Pug, expect him to follow you around in the house, sit in your lap, and want to sleep in bed with you.Pug enthusiasts are a fun-loving bunch. They love Pug get-togethers, Pug parades, and dressing up their Pugs.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Pugs weigh between 14 and 18 pounds (male and female). Generally, they are 10 to 14 inches tall at the shoulder.","Don't expect a Pug to hunt, guard or retrieve. Pugs were bred to be companions, and that's exactly what they do best. The Pug craves affection — and your lap — and is very unhappy if his devotion isn't reciprocated.He tends to be a sedentary dog, content to sit in your lap as you read a book or watch a movie. This doesn't mean the Pug is a stick-in-the-mud. Au contraire. He is a playful, comical dog that enjoys living it up, and delights his owner with silly antics.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Pug needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Pug puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Pugs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pugs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Pugs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Cheyletiella Dermatitis (Walking Dandruff): This is a skin condition that is caused by a small mite. If you see heavy dandruff, especially down the middle of the back, contact your vet. The mites that cause this condition are contagious, which means all pets in the household need to treated.Pug Dog Encephalitis: PDE is a fatal inflammatory brain disease that is unique to Pugs. Medical researchers don't know why Pugs develop this condition; there is no way test for it or to treat it. A diagnosis of PDE can only be made by testing the brain tissue of the dog after it dies. PDE usually affects young dogs, causing them to seizure, circle, become blind, then fall into a coma and die. This can happen in a few days or weeks. Since PDE seems to have a genetic component, the Pug Dog Club of America, along with the American Kennel Club Canine Health Foundation, is sponsoring research projects to try to learn more about this devastating disease.Epilepsy: PDE isn't the only thing that can cause Pugs to seizure. They are prone to a condition called idiopathic epilepsy: seizures for no known reason. If your Pug has seizures, take him to your vet to determine what treatment is appropriate.Nerve Degeneration: Older Pugs that drag their rear, stagger, have trouble jumping up or down, or become incontinent may be suffering from nerve degeneration. Pugs affected with this condition don't appear to be in pain and the condition usually advances slowly. Researchers aren't sure why it occurs. Since their front legs often remain strong, some owners buy carts to help their Pugs get around, and the veterinarian might be able to prescribe medication to help alleviate symptoms.Corneal Ulcers: Because his eyes are so large and prominent, the Pug's eyes can be injured easily or develop ulcers on the cornea (the clear part of the eye). If your Pug squints or the eyes look red and tear excessively, contact your vet immediately. Corneal ulcers usually respond well to medication, but if left untreated, can cause blindness or even rupture the eye.Dry Eye: Keratoconjunctivitis sicca and pigmentary keratitis are two conditions seen in Pugs. They can occur at the same time, or individually. Dry eye is caused when the eyes don't produce enough tears to stay moist. Your vet can perform tests to determine if this is the cause, which can be controlled with medication and special care. Pigmentary keratits is a condition that causes black spots on the cornea, especially in the corner near the nose. If the pigment covers the eye, it can cause blindness. Your vet can prescribe medication that will help keep the eyes moist and dissolve the pigment. Both of these eye conditions require life-long therapy and care.Eye Problems: Because their large eyes bulge, Pugs are prone to a variety of eye problems, including proptosis (the eyeball is dislodged from the eye socket and the eyelid clamps behind it); distichiasis (an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye); progressive retinal atrophy (a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells that leads to blindness); and entropion (the eyelid, usually the lower lid, rolls inward, causing the hair on the lid to rub on the eye and irritate it).Allergies: Some Pugs suffer from a variety of allergies, ranging from contact to food allergies. If your Pug is licking at his paws or rubbing his face a great deal, suspect allergy and have him checked by your vet.Demodectic Mange: Also called demodicosis, all dogs carry a little passenger called a demodex mite. The mother dog passes this mite to her pups in their first few days of life. The mite can't be passed to humans or other dogs; only the mother passes mites to her pups. Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause any problems. If your Pug has a weakened or compromised immune system, however, it can develop demodectic mange. Demodectic mange can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly, skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It's thought of as a puppy disease, and often clears up on its own. Even so, you should take your dog to the vet because it can turn into the generalized form of demodectic mange. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link.Staph Infection: Staph bacteria is commonly found on skin, but some dogs will develop pimples and infected hair follicles if their immune systems are stressed. The lesions can look like hives where there is hair; on areas without hair, the lesions can look like ringworm. You should contact your vet for appropriate treatment.Yeast Infection: If your Pug smells bad, is itchy and has blackened, thickened skin, he may have a yeast infection. It commonly affects the armpits, feet, groin, neck, and inside the ears. Your vet can prescribe medications to clear this up.Hemi-vertebrae: Short-nosed breeds, such as Pugs, Bulldogs and French Bulldogs, can have misshaped vertebrae. Sometimes, only a few of the vertebrae are affected and the dog is able to live a normal life. Others will stagger and display an uncoordinated, weak gait between 4 and 6 months of age. Some dogs get progressively worse and may even become paralyzed. The cause of the condition is unknown. Surgery can help.Hip Dysplasia: This malady affects small breeds as well as large breeds, including Pugs. Many factors, including genetics, environment and diet, are thought to contribute to this deformity of the hip joint. Affected Pugs are usually able to lead normal, healthy lives with proper veterinary attention.Legg-Perthes Disease: This is another disease involving the hip joint. Many toy breeds are prone to this condition. When your Pug has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. Usually, the first signs of Legg-Perthes, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, occur when puppies are 4 to 6 months old. The condition can be corrected with surgery to cut off the diseased femur so that it isn't attached to the pelvis any longer. The scar tissue that results from the surgery creates a false joint and the puppy is usually pain free.Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Vaccination Sensitivity: There are reports of Pugs suffering from sensitivity to routine vaccinations. Usually, symptoms include hives, facial swelling, soreness and lethargy. A dog that is sensitive to vaccines can develop complications or die, though this is rare. Watch your Pug carefully for a few hours after being vaccinated and call the vet if you notice anything unusual.","Though playful and rambunctious, the Pug is a low-maintenance companion, making it ideal for older owners. Because they are a small, quiet breed and are relatively inactive when indoors, they are a good choice for apartment dwellers as well.Their compact package belies a great deal of energy, so expect to be entertained with some goofy antics if your Pug doesn't get a walk or some playtime. They are sensitive to heat and humidity, however, so if you live in a hot or humid environment, be sure your Pug doesn't spend too much time outside.Light sleepers may also want to invest in a pair of ear plugs — Pugs are prone to snore.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.While the Pug's first love is human attention, his second love is food. These dogs love to eat, eat, eat. This, combined with their small stature, puts them at risk for obesity. As a Pug owner, you must show great restraint. Do not indulge him with food. Feed appropriate portions, limit treats and encourage exercise.For more on feeding your Pug, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Even though the coats are short, Pugs are a double-coated breed. Pugs are typically fawn-colored or black. The fawn color can have different tints, such as apricot or silver, and all Pugs have a short, flat, black muzzle.The coat is short and smooth, but don't be deceived. Pugs shed like crazy, especially in summer. The wise Pug owner accepts this, and adjusts her wardrobe accordingly, wearing light-colored clothing that better hides hair.Following that, regular brushing and bathing helps keep the coat in good condition and shedding to a minimum. A monthly bath is sufficient, though some owners bathe their Pugs more frequently. The Pug's small size is handy: you can drop him right in the kitchen or utility sink for a bath.Regular nail trimming is essential, since these housedogs don't usually wear down their nails outdoors like active breeds do. It's a good idea to clean the Pug's ears every few weeks, as well.What requires special attention is the Pug's facial wrinkles. These folds are hotbeds for infection if allowed to become damp or dirty. The wrinkles must be dried thoroughly after bathing, and wiped out in-between baths. Some owners simply use a dry cotton ball; others use commercial baby wipes to wipe out the folds.Additionally, the Pug's bulging eyes need special attention. Because they protrude, the eyes are vulnerable to injury and irritation from soaps and chemicals.Like many small breeds, the Pug can be susceptible to gum disease. Regular brushing with a small, soft toothbrush and doggie toothpaste helps prevent this.Begin accustoming your Pug to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Pugs love kids. Though small, the Pug is not delicate like some toy breeds, so he is a good breed choice for families with children. However, children who want an active pet to retrieve balls or play soccer will be disappointed with a Pug. Adults should always supervise interactions between children and pets.Properly trained and socialized, the Pug enjoys the companionship of dogs, and can be trusted with cats, rabbits, and other animals.","Pugs are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Train them with positive reinforcement techniques, such as food rewards, praise, and play.Puggles generally do well with other dogs and pets, although they may chase smaller pets..Loving and gentle, the Puggle can make an excellent companion to anyone, including first-time dog owners, and will do well with children of all ages.Puggles are companion dogs and may suffer from separation anxiety when they're left alone for long periods.Puggles can adapt to any type of home, from city apartment to suburban house. However, beware if your housing has noise restrictions — barking or howling is a common trait in Puggles.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.",Most Puggles are 13 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 18 to 30 pounds. Toy-size Puggles are usually less than 13 inches tall and weigh 8 to 17 pounds.,"The Puggle is a sweet, intelligent dog who can fit easily into family life. They can be playful and cuddly and enjoy spending time with the people in their lives. Puggles usually get along well with everyone, including kids and other pets. Potential behavior problems include howling, barking, digging, or wandering.Like all dogs, Puggles need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Puggle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Not all Puggles will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Stenotic Nares, also known as pinched nostrils, is a congenital disorder (meaning the dog is born with it). It affects dogs with short muzzles and makes it difficult for them to breathe. Signs include noisy breathing and exercise intolerance. Dogs that aren't getting enough oxygen may have blue gums. Mild cases can be managed by preventing obesity, limiting exercise during hot or humid weather, and using a harness instead of a neck collar. More severe cases may require surgical repair.Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog's fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with daily medication. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog that is being treated for hypothyroidism can live a full and happy life.Patellar Luxation, also known as ""slipped stifles,"" is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts-the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf)-is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Epilepsy is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be managed with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of epilepsy, which can be either hereditary or of unknown cause.Cherry Eye occurs when the gland located in the dog's third eyelid (known as the nictitating membrane) bulges out. It looks like a reddened mass at the inner corner of the eye. Cherry eye can be repaired surgically.If you're buying a Puggle, it's important to research the health conditions that affect both the Pug and the Beagle. Both parents should have health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, patellas (knees), and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","Puggles are people-lovers and should live indoors with the family, not outside. So long as they're indoor dogs and get enough exercise, they can adapt to any living situation, including apartments — although they can bark a lot. Some even have a tendency to howl, a trait they inherit from their Beagle parent.Puggles are intelligent but can be stubborn. They'll respond best to training that uses positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, play, and praise. Ample exercise will help keep them from becoming unruly. Give your Puggle a couple of 15-minute walks or playtimes every day. Be sure to always walk your Puggle on leash or play with him in a securely fenced area. Beagles may ignore commands when they've picked up an interesting scent, and some Puggles have the same tendency.","Recommended daily amount: 5/8 to 1.5 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Like their parent breeds, Puggles enjoy their meals and are prone to obesity. Keep your Puggle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time.If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Puggle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Puggle has a short, smooth, double coat. The undercoat is short and dense, covered by a slightly longer topcoat. Colors include fawn, red, tan, lemon, black, or any of those colors with white (known as particolor). Some Puggles have black masks on the face.Puggles shed, like both their parent breeds. Brush your Puggle weekly to get rid of excess hair. Bathe him only as needed, but be sure to keep the folds on his skin and around his muzzle and eyes free of dirt, debris, and moisture to prevent infections. After a bath, it's very important to dry thoroughly between any folds. Check your Puggle's eyes regularly to ensure that they're clean and free of any irritation, indicated by redness or discharge.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Puggle's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Puggle jumps up to greet you.Start grooming your Puggle when he's a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","The Puggle is generally a sweet-tempered dog who gets along well with children of all ages. Even so, it's important to always teach children how to approach and touch your Puggle, and to supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent biting or ear pulling from either party.Puggles are sociable and generally do well with other dogs and pets. They may chase smaller pets, however, especially if they've inherited their Beagle parent's hunting instincts. Proper training, plus lots of exposure to small pets, beginning in puppyhood, can minimize this trait.",This cross is often available at local animal shelters.

Agility and herding are much more to his liking.The Puli can be a bit stubborn, so housetraining might be a challenge at first. Crate training is recommended.Pulik have a reputation for remaining puppyish well into their older years. They love to play and like to have a lot of toys.Grooming the Puli is difficult, especially if the coat is corded. New owners should seek help to learn how to properly groom their dogs.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males are 17 inches tall and weigh 30 to 35 pounds. Females are 16 inches tall and weigh 25 to 30 pounds.,"The unusual corded coat often draws the attention of those unfamiliar with the breed. But to those who know and love the Puli, it's his personality that stands out.The Puli is fun-loving and affectionate, and he enjoys the company of his family. He's also smart, hardworking, and athletic. Being suspicious of strangers, he makes a good watchdog. He's also a strong-willed dog who requires a firm but kind owner. Don't be surprised when he tries to ""herd"" you or your children.Many Pulik are vocal and like to bark. A ""quiet"" command should be part of early training.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Puli needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Puli puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Pulik are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Pulik will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Pulik, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Cataracts: These afflictions cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.","The Puli is a herding dog at heart, and he does best in a home with enough space for him to race off his natural energy. A large, fenced yard (make that a very tall fence) or a farm is ideal. He can adjust to smaller living spaces, but be prepared for his running laps around the dining room chairs and taking leaps over the couch.Exercise and playtime aside, bring the Puli indoors to live with you. He's a loyal companion who enjoys being with people, and he shouldn't be permanently relegated to the backyard.The agile Puli is a good candidate for many canine sports, especially herding tests, agility, and obedience competition (though obedience work can seem repetitive to the fun-loving Puli). If he's not a working dog, he needs the mental and physical challenges available in dog sports. Otherwise he can become bored, which can lead to destructive behaviors such as barking, digging, and chewing.The Puli's agility can get him in trouble, however. It's been reported that Pulik can jump six-foot fences, so be sure your yard has a secure, high fence to keep him from escaping and injuring himself.Proper training and socialization are essential for the strong-willed Puli. He must learn good canine manners, and you must learn not to be bossed around by him. This dog is a leader, and he will lead you if you allow him to.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Most Pulik are black, though white and gray are also found in the United States. In Hungary, the most common color after black is the brownish fako (described as the color of a whole-wheat roll).Black coats are described as a ""weathered"" black, because some white hairs begin to grow in when the dog is about a year old. In addition, because the cords don't shed, they lose some of their color intensity over time due to exposure to the sun and air.Some Puli coats are self-cording, though most are helped along by humans who separate the cords by hand when the adult coat comes in (at about one year of age). As the coat texture changes from puppy fluff to adult coat, the undercoat is packed into the interior of the outer coat tendril to form a felt-like structure. It takes about four years for the coat to become fully mature.Keep the fluffy, uncorded Puli coat in good condition through regular brushing and combing to remove tangles and dirt and to distribute natural skin oils.The corded coat is never brushed but managed by hand: first it's dampened with water, then the cords are separated and twirled. The length of the corded coat is sometimes trimmed to keep it from collecting dust and dirt.Bathing a fluffy Puli coat is like bathing any other breed. Put the dog in the tub, add water and soap, and scrub.Dunking your corded-coat Puli in the tub, however, is a time-consuming task that takes a lot of hard work.First, the cords must be thoroughly soaked with water (this takes a while), and then you can work in some diluted shampoo. Rinsing can take up to 30 minutes. Following that, the cords are squeezed dry, first by hand and then with a towel. After a bath, some owners put a heavy sweatshirt on the Puli to continue soaking up the water.Air-drying the coat can take up to two days. Heat drying is not recommended because of the length of time it takes to dry the cords; the Puli can become overheated and, more commonly, irritated with the lengthy drying process.For obvious reasons, it's not advisable to bathe the corded Puli frequently. However, there are times it's necessary: the corded coat collects food (around the face), eye matter, urine, feces, and burrs.Brush your Puli's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Puli to being examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The well-socialized and well-trained Puli is a good companion for children. He's playful — probably even more playful than the kids. He's protective of the children in his family and shuttle them around the house, tugging gently at them to move them away from perceived (or real) danger.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Puli gets along with other dogs and pets, as long as he taught to do so from a young age. Early, positive introductions to other animals make it easy for the adult Puli to accept other pets into his home.","Puli are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

The UKC doesn't have a specified weight for standard Rat Terriers as each individual dog has a different weight for their height.The Decker Rat Terrier is slightly larger than the Rat Terrier and should range between 22 to 40 pounds. A male should be 16 to 19 inches in height while a female should be 16 to 17 inches.The miniature Rat Terrier should weigh 10 to 18 pounds and should not be larger than 15 inches in height.The toy Rat Terrier is an even smaller version of the breed. His weight should range between 5 to 10 pounds and he should be no larger than 12 inches in height.,"Intelligent, wary, and stubborn, this breed is a dynamo. Understand their general dislike of strangers and know that most warm up to visitors (although chances of that happening are slimmer if you're not there). If they're not properly socialized they will be fine with their family but they could become aggressive to strangers and other animals. They are also absolutely fearless, which can be a wonderful trait, though not if they are aggressive.A good family pet, Rat Terriers are amazingly perceptive and intuitively respond to your moods. They have a great desire to please, love praise, and will follow you around the house. Bred to work all day on the farm, these guys need a lot of exercise and if they don't get it, their sharp little minds can turn devious to amuse themselves. Their people live with the mantra that a tired dog is a good dog.As with every dog, the Rat Terrier needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Rat Terrier is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Incorrect Bites: Malocclusion, or incorrect bite, is a slightly deformed jaw structure that leaves the jaw misaligned. There are three different types of incorrect bites, all of which are seen in Rat Terriers. An overshot bite is caused when the upper jaw is extended past the lower jaw; this causes difficulties in grasping and in more severe cases; the lower teeth can bite into the roof of the mouth. An undershot bite is when the lower jaw extends out past the upper jaw; although it is standard in some breeds, it can cause difficulties in the Rat Terrier and may need to be corrected with surgery. The last type is wry mouth, which is a twisting of the mouth caused by one side growing faster then the other; it causes difficulties with eating and grasping. In some cases, each type of incorrect bites can self-correct while the puppy is still growing. If the incorrect bite has not self-corrected by the time the puppy is 10 months of age, it is not likely to. If surgery is needed, wait until the puppy has finished growing. Corrective surgeries can include tooth extraction, crown height reductions or the use of spacers.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Demodectic Mange: Sometimes called demodicosis, this condition is caused by the demodex mite, which a mother dog passes to her pups in their first few days of life. (The mite can't be passed to humans or to other dogs; only by mother to pups.) Demodex mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause problems, but if your Rat Terrier has a weakened or compromised immune system, he can develop demodectic mange. In its localized form, patches of red, scaly, balding skin appear on the head, neck and forelegs. It often clears up on its own, but even so, you should take your dog to the vet to prevent it from turning into the generalized form of demodectic mange, which covers the entire body and causes infection.","Crate train your Rat Terrier if you wish to leave the puppy out when he reaches adulthood. Regardless of breed, puppies explore, get into things they shouldn't, and chew things that can harm them. It can be expensive both in fixing or replacing destroyed items and the veterinary bills that could arise.Never stick your Rat Terrier in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Rat Terriers are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount of high-quality dry food a day for your Rat Terrier:Less than 10 pounds: 1/4 to 1/2 cup per day10-15 pounds 1/2 to 1 cup per day20-30 pounds 3/4 to 1.5 cups per day30-40 pounds 1.5 to 2 cups per dayNOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

You'll see it in several colors and combinations of colors, including white, black with tan or rust, white and black or tan, red, lemon, blue, chocolate and orange. Ticking (intermittent spots) and dark colors are seen too. Generally speaking, all Rats have white markings.The Rat Terrier is a wonderfully low-maintenance dog to groom and only needs weekly brushings with a soft brush or a rubber curry mitt to remove loose hair.

Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Although Rats who aren't used to children should be supervised, most Rats are wonderfully patient with kids, even kids who aren't part of the family. They are extremely fond of their family kids. Parents who don't like the idea of the family dog sleeping under the covers with the kids might be in for trouble.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Although there may be a few disagreements regarding food and sleeping arrangements, the Rat Terrier likes other dogs. He doesn't spar with them and generally is not aggressive towards them.As a matter of fact, many Rats want to play with other dogs, so you need to be on your lookout for dog-reactive or aggressive dogs. Once an aggressive dog provokes a fight, these terriers return the emotion. Unfortunately, they are size-blind and don't care if the aggressor outweighs them five times over.Rats are prey-driven so any small, quick moving animal, including a hamster, mouse, chinchilla, and of course, a rat, is seen as prey, and may be chased. If a Rat is raised with a cat, bird, chicken, or other animal in a household, they will generally get along as family members.","Rat Terriers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Rat Terriers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

However, he can still be aggressive toward strange animals outside the family, even if he's well socialized and trained. Males can be aggressive toward other males, especially if they're not neutered.If bored, the Rhodesian Ridgeback can become very destructive.The Rhodesian Ridgeback needs a high fence to keep him from escaping and roaming. An underground electronic fence won't contain him.Rhodesian Ridgebacks shed little, and you can keep them clean with a weekly brushing and a wipedown with a damp cloth. They also need regular nail trims and tooth brushing.Training can be difficult if you don't start at a very young age. Rhodesian Ridgebacks can be stubborn and strong willed, but if you're consistent, firm, and fair, you can train your Ridgeback to a high level.The young Rhodesian Ridgeback is energetic and active, but with maturity and training, he generally becomes a calm and quiet dog. He needs at least a half hour of daily exercise.Rhodesian Ridgebacks can adapt to a number of living situations, including apartments, if they're properly exercised. The ideal is a home with a large fenced yard.Ridgebacks generally don't bark a lot. Many will bark to alert you to something unusual, and some will bark when they are bored, but for the most part, this isn't a yappy breed.Rhodesian Ridgebacks aren't serious diggers, but they'll dig a large hole if they're bored or to escape the heat.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.",A Rhodesian Ridgeback male stands 25 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs about 85 pounds; females are 24 to 26 inches tall and weigh around 70 pounds.,"The Rhodesian Ridgeback is independent and intelligent, a combination that can be entertaining, frustrating, and rewarding, all in one. It's important to begin training early and to be firm — but not harsh — and consistent.Because of his hunting roots, the Rhodesian Ridgeback has a high prey drive. That means stray cats and other small furry animals aren't safe in your yard, and it also means your yard should be securely fenced, to prevent him from going hunting on his own.Exuberant and active in puppyhood, he matures into a quiet dog with moderate exercise needs. The Ridgeback is protective of his home and a discriminating barker who can be counted on to alert you to trouble. He's reserved with strangers but gentle and affectionate with family members.Like every dog, Rhodesian Ridgebacks need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Ridgeback puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Rhodesian Ridgebacks are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can get certain health conditions. Not all Ridgebacks will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Rhodesian Ridgebacks, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, and thyroid and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old. The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur:Elbow Dysplasia is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication and weight loss to control the pain.Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Dermoid Sinus is a congenital skin defect in which a cyst or narrow tubelike structure occurs along the spinal area. It can penetrate the skin to varying degrees, and some reach into the muscle tissue and can be attached to the spinal cord. If the dermoid sinus becomes infected it can cause other problems. Some puppies with this defect are euthanized, but others are treated with surgery.","Rhodesian Ridgebacks can adapt to a variety of homes, including apartments, as long as they get daily exercise. They should live in the house with their people, not outdoors in a run or kennel.Access to a securely fenced yard is ideal. They'll try to escape if bored, so in addition to ensuring that your fence can't be jumped or climbed over or dug under, keep your Ridgeback busy with training, play, or dog sports. Sending him out into the yard by himself for hours on end is an invitation to destruction. Even if he's not especially bored, a Ridgeback is often inclined to dig large holes so he can rest in the cool and comfortable dirt. Be prepared to give him part of the yard or resign yourself to having a cratered yard that resembles the surface of the moon.Give your Rhodesian Ridgeback a couple of 15- to 20-minute walks or playtimes daily, plus opportunities to run in a safely fenced area a couple of times a week. Because of the breed's strong prey drive, keeping him on leash in unfenced areas is a must. Your Ridgeback will take off after a cat, rabbit, or bicyclist, no matter how well you think he's trained.Ridgebacks are generally discriminating barkers, meaning they only bark at things that are important, but any dog can become a nuisance barker if he doesn't have anything else to do.Begin training early, first with puppy kindergarten, followed by a basic obedience class. The Rhodesian Ridgeback has a mind of his own and can be stubborn. To train him successfully, you must be firm and consistent but not harsh. Use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.","Recommended daily amount: 2 3/4 to 4 3/8 cups of a high-quality food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Ridgebacks enjoy their food and are known countersurfers. Keep food well out of reach and consider dog-proofing your cabinets to keep your dog from getting his own snacks.Keep your Ridgeback in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Ridgeback, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Ridgeback coat is short and shiny and tends to be odor-free. Ridgebacks who live indoors shed a little year-round, while those who live outdoors have heavier seasonal shedding.The color of the coat ranges from light wheaten to red wheaten; in other words, buff to gold to reddish gold. Some Ridgebacks have black on the muzzle, ears, or around the eyes.The distinct, tapering ridge of hair on his back grows in the opposite direction of the rest of the coat, and starts just behind the shoulder and runs to a point between the rise of the hips. The ridge usually has two whorls — hair growing in a circular pattern — directly opposite each other. These whorls are known as crowns, and a Ridgeback with only one crown or with more than two crowns stands little chance in the show ring.When it comes to grooming, the Rhodesian Ridgeback is pretty low-maintenance. Give him a good going over with a rubber curry brush weekly to remove loose or dead hair, then wipe him down with a damp cloth. Voila! A clean Ridgeback.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Ridgeback's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don't get caught in the carpet and tear.Start grooming your Ridgeback when he's a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","The Rhodesian Ridgeback is tolerant with children of all ages, but he's large and can be too rambunctious for a toddler.As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your Rhodesian Ridgeback, and supervise all interactions between dogs and young kids to prevent any biting or tail pulling from either party.The Rhodesian Ridgeback does well with other pets if he's raised with them. Males tend to be aggressive to other males, especially if they're not neutered. It's important to properly socialize a Rhodesian Ridgeback to other dogs and animals — expose him to lots of other creatures beginning in puppyhood — because the tolerance he shows animals in his home is often not extended to animals outside his family.","Rhodesian Ridgebacks are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Ridgebacks end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you're interested in adopting an adult Rhodesian Ridgeback who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Rhodesian Ridgeback Rescue IncRidgeback Rescue of the United States",not available

In some areas, you may not even be able to own a Rottweiler, or may be forced to give up any that you have.Rottweilers love people and want to be with their families. If they are left alone for long periods of time or don't receive adequate exercise, they may become destructive.If raised with children, well-bred Rottweilers get along fine with them. They must be taught, however, what is acceptable behavior with children. Rotties have a natural instinct to herd and may ""bump"" children to herd them. Because of their size, this ""bump"" may cause toddlers to fall down and injure themselves. In addition, some Rottweilers have a strong prey drive and may get overly excited when children run and play. Always supervise your Rottweiler when he's around children.If you have an adult Rottweiler, introduce new animals, especially dogs, carefully. Rottweilers can be aggressive toward strange dogs, particularly those of the same sex. Under your leadership, however, your Rottie will probably learn to coexist peacefully with his new companion.Rottweilers are intelligent and are highly trainable if you're firm and consistent.Rottweilers will test you to see if you really mean what you say. Be specific in what you ask, and don't leave any loopholes for them to exploit.Rottweilers require a couple of 10- to 20-minute walks or playtimes daily.Rottweilers have a double coat and shed heavily in the spring and the fall, moderately throughout the rest of the year.Many Rottweilers snore.If their food intake is not monitored, Rotties have a tendency to overeat and can gain weight.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Males typically are 24 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 95 to 130 pounds. Females typically are 22 to 25 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 85 to 115 pounds.,"The ideal Rottweiler is calm, confident, and courageous, never shy. He has a self-assured aloofness and doesn't make friends with people immediately or indiscriminately. Instead, he takes a wait-and-see attitude with new people or situations. With his family, he's affectionate, often following them around the house. This is not a highly excitable dog. He has an inherent desire to protect his family and property, but should never be aggressive toward people without cause. The Rottweiler is smart and adaptable with a strong work ethic.You'll see some differences between the sexes. Males are quiet but watchful, constantly assessing their surroundings for threats. Females are somewhat easier to control and may be more affectionate. Both are highly trainable but can be stubborn.Rottweilers require firm, consistent but not harsh discipline. A sharp word is often a sufficient reprimand, but only if you've clearly established your leadership. If not, he may try to bully or bluff you. This is not a dog for people who lack assertiveness or don't have time to devote to training and supervision. Earning a Rottweiler's respect involves setting boundaries and teaching consequences for inappropriate behavior, both of which take time and patience.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Rotties need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Rottweiler puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Rottweilers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Rotties will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Rotties, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dyplasia: Elbow dysplasia is a hereditary malformation of the elbow joint. The severity of the dysplasia can only be determined by x-rays. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, or medication to control the pain.Aortic Stenosis/Sub-aortic Stenosis (AS/SAS): This common heart defect is sometimes seen in Rottweilers. The aorta narrows below the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to supply blood to the body. This condition can cause fainting and even sudden death. It's an inherited condition, but its mode of transmission isn't known at this time. Typically, a veterinary cardiologist diagnoses this condition after a heart murmur has been detected.Osteosarcoma: Generally affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is lameness, but the dog will need x-rays to determine if the cause is cancer. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with the amputation of the limb and chemotherapy. With treatment, dogs can live nine months to two years or more. Luckily, dogs adapt well to life on three legs and don't suffer the same side effects to chemotherapy as humans, such as nausea and hair loss.Gastric Dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs like Rottweilers, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeder and type of food might be a factor in causing this to happen too. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Panosteitis (Pano): This is sometimes referred to as ""growing pains"" because it usually occurs in puppies when they are around four months old. The primary symptom is lameness. Often, rest will be all that is needed, but if your puppy starts limping, it's a good idea to have your vet check him.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog's fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.","It's important for Rottweilers to live in the home with their people. If they're left alone in a backyard all the time, they can become bored, destructive, and aggressive. Although they're large, Rottweilers are inactive indoors.A Rottweiler is a homebody, but he requires a fenced yard not only to protect him from traffic but also because he can be aggressive toward other dogs and strangers who come onto his property. An underground electronic fence can't keep your Rottie in your yard if he really wants to get out. More important, it doesn't prevent people or other animals from coming onto your property. Put up a sign advising strangers and non-family members not to come onto your property without your escort.The Rottweiler's energy level ranges from couch potato to whirlwind. Be sure to tell the breeder what kind of energy level suits you so she can help you choose the best puppy for your lifestyle. Moderately active Rottweilers will appreciate a couple of 10- to 20-minute walks each day. They also enjoy playing with balls and going hiking. More energetic Rotties may need longer exercise times and more structured activities. Their athleticism, intelligence, and trainability make them well suited to agility and obedience competition, as well as tracking, therapy work, and their traditional job, pulling a cart or wagon. Perfect for parades!When training your Rottweiler, keep in mind that he thrives on mental stimulation. He likes to learn new things and is eager to please you. He might be willful at times, with a ""Show me why I should do this"" attitude. Be fair, consistent, and firm, and your Rottweiler will reward you with his quick ability to learn.Your Rottweiler shouldn't be difficult to housetrain given a consistent schedule, no opportunities to have accidents in the house, and positive reinforcement when he potties outdoors.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 10 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The outer coat is medium in length, shorter on the head, ears, and legs; the undercoat is found mainly on the neck and thighs. The amount of undercoat your Rottie has depends on the climate in which he lives.The Rottweiler is always black with markings that are rust to mahogany in color. The markings appear over the eyes, on the cheeks, on each side of the muzzle, on the chest and legs, and beneath the tail. There are also tan lines that resemble pencil marks on the toes.Brush your Rottie weekly with a firm bristle brush to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. He'll shed twice a year, and you'll probably want to brush more frequently during that time to keep the loose hair under control. Bathe him as needed. If you bathe him outdoors, it should be warm enough that you're comfortable without wearing long sleeves or a coat. If you aren't, it's too cold to be giving your Rottie a bath out there.Brush your Rottie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Begin accustoming your Rottweiler to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Rottweilers typically like children, especially if they're raised with them. When around children, especially young ones, they should be supervised because they are so big and strong. Because of their cattle-driving heritage, they have a tendency to lean and push and can accidentally topple a toddler with a nudge.They're probably best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. It's also important to supervise your Rottweiler any time your children have friends over. Rotties can be perturbed by loud or rough play between kids and may take steps to put a stop to it, not understanding that ""his"" children aren't in danger. They may also chase young children who are running.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.When Rottweilers are raised with other dogs and cats, they generally get along well with them. They may have issues with strange dogs or adult dogs that are introduced into the home, being intolerant of same-sex dogs. With your training and guidance, however, they should accept new animals peaceably. Keep your Rottie on leash in public to prevent aggression or belligerence toward other dogs. The Rottie is not the best candidate for visiting off-leash dog parks.","Rottweilers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Rotties in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They are not purebreds like their Saint Bernard or Poodle parents.Two common color combinations of Saint Berdoodles are white-and-brown and white-and-black. They can also be red with white accents or white with red accents.The coats of Saint Berdoodles can take after either parent--wiry and curly for the Poodle, or longer and smooth or rough for the Saint Bernard.Saint Berdoodles are generally pretty well-equipped for cold weather, especially if their coats are similar to Saint Bernards. They aren't quite as tolerant of high heat.Saint Berdoodles are great with people of all ages, including kids. The only concern with these dogs is their size with very young children. Be sure to supervise interactions with very young children in case of accidental stepping or sitting.These dogs do not enjoy being alone, so they would love the company of other pets and family members.The Poodle's sense of adventure and higher energy, mixed with the Saint Bernard's inquisitiveness and laid-back attitude, means you should be prepared to offer your dog outdoor exercise time every day, along with opportunities for nap time afterward.","Though there is quite a range of sizes for Saint Berdoodles, you can expect a larger dog, in general. It is very unlikely a smaller Miniature or Toy Poodle than the Standard Poodle would breed with a Saint Bernard. Saint Bernards are always large, and Standard Poodles are medium-to-large.In terms of weight, the smallest you're likely to find a Saint Berdoodle would be 40 pounds--that would be the low side of a female Standard Poodle's weight range--a male would start at 50 pounds. The high side of a Saint Bernard's weight range is 180 pounds, so that's the top size you could expect with this mixed breed.In terms of height, the range is typically between 15 and 30 inches.There have been attempts at creating a Miniature Saint Berdoodle, with a weight between 20 and 50 pounds, and a height between 14 and 18 inches, but miniaturizing a Saint Bernard usually involves breeding with a smaller dog, too--most commonly the Cocker Spaniel. Therefore, the ""Miniature Saint Berdoodle"" actually involves three breeds.","The Saint Berdoodle combines many of the best personality traits from Saint Bernards and Poodles. You can expect your Saint Berdoodle to be friendly and affectionate, always wanting to be part of family activities. They're very social and prefer not to be left alone for long periods of time. The Saint Bernard's curiosity and the Poodle's intelligence make for a clever pup, indeed. The easy trainability of the Poodle helps to nip Saint Bernards' potential mischief in the bud if they're trained and socialized at a young age.Saint Bernards have earned the term ""nanny dog,"" for the protective, gentle, and loving natures. The only reason you may need to supervise interactions with Saint Berdoodles and very small children is just that these dogs are often quite large, so accidents may happen with sitting or stepping.The Poodle's sense of adventure and higher energy, mixed with the Saint Bernard's inquisitiveness and laid-back attitude, means you should be prepared to offer your dog outdoor exercise time every day, along with opportunities for nap time afterward.Saint Berdoodles are eager to please and quite agreeable--you couldn't ask for an easier-going, more affectionate family dog.","Saint Berdoodles are fairly healthy dogs. While mixing breeds can be a way to minimize genetic disorders, the resulting crossbreed can still inherit health problems from the parent breeds. Regular care and annual veterinary check-ups are a good way to keep your dog in prime health.Some of the more common health problems for Saint Berdoodles include:hip dysplasiaear infectionsWobbler Syndromebloatskin problemsWillebrand's diseases – which impact the blood's ability to clot.","In addition to annual check-ups at the vet--and, of course, additional visits should you notice any health concerns developing--there are some basic care tasks you can perform at home to keep your Saint Berdoodle in peak health.Saint Berdoodles have a range of energy, which can be high with a Poodle or low with a Saint Bernard. In general, they should be allowed some time to exercise, play, and explore outside every day. A few shorter walks are a better idea than one long one with this mixed breed. They may need to nap during the day, too.Saint Berdoodles do have long ears, but they're not necessarily prone to ear infections. Be sure to check their ears for debris regularly. Your vet may recommend occasional cleaning with a vet-approved solution and cloth. Also, check their eyes every so often to make sure they are clear of infection/debris.Regular nail trims are also important, approximately once a month, or as needed. An easy way to tell if they're too long is to listen for clicking on the floor when your dog walks--if you hear it, it's time for a trim. You can do this yourself with special trimmers, or you can ask a groomer for assistance.Your Saint Berdoodle's teeth should be brushed two to three times per week.","An ideal Saint Berdoodle diet should be formulated for a large breed with medium energy. You'll have to evaluate your dog's energy level for yourself, as it depends which parent your dog takes after--the higher-energy Poodle, or the lower-energy St. Bernard.As with all dogs, the Saint Berdoodle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Saint Berdoodle's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Saint Berdoodles have a variety of color combinations, mostly based on their parents. Two common color combinations are white-and-brown and white-and-black. They can also be red with white accents or white with red accents.The coats of Saint Berdoodles can take after either parent--wiry and curly for the Poodle, or longer and smooth or rough for the Saint Bernard.Saint Berdoodles are generally a lower-maintenance mixed breed. If they have the curly coat of the Poodle, they won't need frequent brushing, but they will require regular trims at the groomer. If they have the shaggier coat of the Saint Bernard, weekly brushing will keep shedding down, or more often during ""shedding season,"" as their coats change for the weather, though Saint Berdoodles are not high on the shedding scale. Bathing should be about once a month, or as needed.Saint Berdoodles are generally pretty well-equipped for cold weather, especially if their coats are similar to Saint Bernards. They aren't quite as tolerant of high heat, so make sure not to have them out too long when temperatures climb, especially over 90 degrees Fahrenheit.","Saint Berdoodles are wonderful with people of all ages, including children. Saint Bernards have earned the nickname of ""nanny dogs,"" after all. The only concern with these dogs is their size, with very young children. Be sure to supervise interactions with very young children in case of accidental stepping or sitting. Some Poodles can be a bit mouthy, so tender baby skin is also of concern when your dog may be playing with or getting to know a child. Mouthiness can be addressed with early training, too.Saint Berdoodles get along very well with other pets, especially if socialized at a young age. Poodles do have some level of hunting instinct--not at the very top range for dogs, but still present--so you will want to supervise activity if there are prey-sized animals in the house.Saint Berdoodles do not enjoy being alone, so they would love the company of other pets and family members.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Saint Berdoodles because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Saint Bernard or Poodle breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well.

They need space to move or just to stretch out in.If you consider yourself a neat freak, then the Saint Bernard is not the breed for you. They drool and their paws track in their fair share of mud. They are heavy shedders and shed, or blow, their coat twice a year.Saint Bernards generally take longer to mature mentally. This leaves you with a very big puppy for several years.Although Saint Bernards make wonderful family pets, they are not recommended for homes with young children, as they can unintentionally knock over and hurt small children.Originally bred to withstand the cold temperatures of the Alps, the Saint Bernard does not do well in heat.Saint Bernards are not known for barking without cause.Saint Bernards are a short-lived breed, usually only 8 to 10 years.The Saint Bernard should not live outdoors away from his family. All dogs do better when they are in the house with the family they love, and the Saint Bernard is no exception. Although their coats and build make them an obvious choice for outdoor living, their temperament and inability to cope with heat makes it a poor decision.Thanks to the popularity of movies such as Beethoven, which features a large Saint Bernard, many irresponsible breeders and puppy mills produce these gentle giants. To make sure you get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Male Saint Bernards stand 28 to 30 inches at the shoulder and weigh 140 to 180 pounds; females are 26 to 28 inches and weigh 120 to 140 pounds.,"True to their heritage as hospice dogs, Saints are friendly and welcoming. They have a steady, benevolent temperament and are kind and careful with children. They love attention but aren't as demanding of it as some breeds.Because of their large size, it's important to begin training Saints at an early age, while they're still easily manageable. They're intelligent and willing to please but sometimes stubborn. They should never be aggressive unless it's in defense of a family member.Like every dog, Saint Bernards need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Saint Bernard puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Saints are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Saints will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Saints, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can also be triggered by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Your vet may recommend surgery to correct the problem, medication to control the pain, or weight management.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Saint has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically.Epilepsy: This disorder causes mild or severe seizures. Epilepsy can be hereditary; it can be triggered by such events as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, or severe head injuries; or it can be of unknown cause (referred to as idiopathic epilepsy). Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. Epilepsy can be controlled with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder. If your Saint has seizures, take him to the vet right away for a diagnosis and treatment recommendations.Dilated Cardiomyopathy: This heart condition occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time.Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. Allergies to certain foods are identified and treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet until the culprit is discovered. Contact allergies are caused by a reaction to something that touches the dog, such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals. They are treated by identifying and removing the cause of the allergy. Inhalant allergies are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV): Also called bloat or torsion, this is a life-threatening condition that can affect deep-chested dogs such as Saint Bernards, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and the type of food might also be factors in bloat. It is more common among older dogs, but can occur at any age. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible. There is some indication that a tendency toward GDV is inherited, so it's recommended that dogs who develop this condition should be neutered or spayed.","Saint Bernards need only moderate amounts of exercise, but it's important that they get it to prevent obesity. Carrying too much weight is hard on their joints and can cause arthritis or orthopedic problems.Limit the amount of exercise you give your Saint Bernard puppy until he reaches mature size. Don't let him put on weight too quickly or run or jump on slick floors. That's just asking for hip problems.Saint Bernards are prone to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Avoid letting them exercise in the heat of the day, and be sure they always have access to shade and fresh water. Be aware of the signs of fatigue and heat exhaustion, which include heavy panting, dark-red gums, and weakness or collapse.An untrained Saint can wreak havoc in your home and drag you down the sidewalk in his eagerness to greet people, so early training is essential. Train your Saint Bernard using a happy and relaxed approach. Lay down ground rules and be consistent in requiring that he follow them.Saint Bernards are naturally friendly, but all puppies benefit from puppy socialization class to help them learn how to properly react to other dogs and strangers. Investing in puppy kindergarten and obedience classes, as well as spending 10 to 15 minutes per day practicing at home, will be well worth your time, effort, and money.Crate training is an important tool that breeders will recommend. It aids in housetraining, keeps your dog or puppy and your belongings safe, and is a safe haven where your Saint Bernard can retreat when he's feeling overwhelmed or tired. A crate should never be used as a punishment but instead should be viewed by your dog as a cozy refuge.The well-trained Saint Bernard is a wonderful family companion and can go on to do many fun activities, including conformation showing (dog shows), obedience trials, and cart pulling.","Recommended daily amount: 5 to 6 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Saint Bernards like to eat and are prone to obesity. Keep your Saint in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time.If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Saint Bernard, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Saint Bernards can be found in two coat types: shorthaired and longhaired. The shorthaired coat is smooth but dense. The hair is slightly bushy on the thighs, and the tail is covered with long, dense hair that becomes shorter toward the tip. The longhaired coat is slightly wavy but never curly or shaggy. The forelegs have a bit of feathering, but the thighs and tail are bushy.Saint Bernards are various shades of red with white or white with red. The red comes in various shades, from brindle patches with white markings to brownish-yellow. The white occurs on the chest, around the neck (known as the collar), around the nose (the noseband), and on the feet and tip of the tail.A white spot on the nape of the neck and a white blaze on the face are especially attractive and desirable, as are dark markings on the head and ears that resemble a mask. The white markings are said to resemble the liturgical vestments worn by a priest and the black mask to reduce the glare from the snow.Brush your Saint about three times a week with a rubber curry brush or hound glove for shorthaired coats or a pin brush for longhaired coats. During shedding season, use a shedding blade to remove loose hair. If your Saint develops mats behind the ears or on the thighs, spray a detangler solution on the area and gently work out the mat with your fingers or a comb.St. Bernards don't need to be bathed frequently. When you do give a bath, it's easiest to do it outdoors unless you have a large walk-in shower. Wintertime baths should always be given indoors unless you live in a climate that's warm year-round.Use a shampoo made for dogs to ensure that the coat doesn't become dry. You may want to use a whitening shampoo to keep the coat its whitest and brightest. Saint Bernards often develop stains around their eyes. Keep the eyes stain-free by wiping them daily with a damp cloth or using a product formulated to remove eye stains, which you can find at pet supply stores.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene, nail care, and ear care. Brush your Saint's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Saint enthusiastically jumps up to greet you. When you trim the nails, trim the hair between the toes at the same time.Check ears weekly. If they look dirty, wipe them clean with a cotton ball, using an ear cleaner recommended by your veterinarian. Never insert a cotton swab into the ear canal.Begin accustoming your Saint to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.If you are unsure about how to groom your Saint Bernard, ask your dog's breeder for advice or take your Saint to a professional groomer.","Saints are, well, saintly around kids. Patient and gentle, they step carefully around them and will put up with a lot. That doesn't mean they should have to, though. Supervise interactions between young children and Saints to make sure there's no ear- or tail-pulling, biting, or climbing on or knocking over on the part of either party.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs and never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how trustworthy or well trained, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Saints can also get along well with other pets, especially if they're introduced to them in puppyhood. Supervise them around smaller dogs and cats just to make sure they don't accidentally step or lie on them.","Saint Bernards are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Saints in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

They require a large fenced yard where they can run safely. Underground electronic fencing is not recommended; their prey drive is so strong they'll push past it.It is important to provide comfortable bedding for a Saluki since he doesn't have enough body fat to provide padding.Salukis should not live outdoors. They thrive on human companionship and will become depressed if left alone for long periods.Although these dogs can make gentle and calm companions for older children, they are not recommended for homes with small children.Salukis are generally quiet dogs.When training a Saluki, be consistent, and use only positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards and praise, since the breed is so sensitive.Salukis are fastidious and like to be clean. They shed little and require only weekly brushing.Salukis should not reside in homes that have small pets. Even with the best training, a Saluki will view small pets as prey and will try to hunt them.Salukis prefer the companionship of other Salukis, but they can get along with other dogs that do not have dominant natures.Salukis can be picky eaters.Never buy a Saluki from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees.

Weight ranges from 35 to 70 pounds.,"The Saluki is an aloof dog, but one who's devoted to his family. He's gentle and thrives on quiet companionship. He has a tendency to bond with a single person, which can lead to separation anxiety.With strangers, Salukis are reserved, and they can be shy if they're not socialized at an early age. Socialization should continue throughout their life. They generally get along with other dogs, but prefer other Salukis, or at least other sighthounds. They're sensitive dogs and will pick up on and become stressed by tensions in the home.Salukis love comfort and enjoy being pampered with soft bedding and access to furniture. Like cats, they're fastidious about personal cleanliness.Like every dog, Salukis need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Saluki puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","The Saluki is a hardy breed that does not suffer from many genetically inherited diseases. The following problems may be seen in Salukis:Anesthesia Sensitivity: Because of their low level of body fat, sighthounds such as the Saluki have a reputation for being sensitive to anesthesia and certain other drugs. Fortunately, the new drugs available these days have properties that make sighthound reactions to drugs much less likely. In addition, most veterinarians are aware of the special anesthesia and drug needs of sighthounds, but it never hurts to confirm this awareness if you're taking your Saluki to a new veterinarian.Hemangiosarcoma: This malignant cancer is found in the lining of blood vessels and the spleen.Cardiomyopathy: This disease of the heart muscle takes two forms: dilated and hypertrophic. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the progressive enlargement of the ventricles, the heart's main pumping chambers. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes a drastic increase in heart muscle mass. DCM is the most common form of cardiomyopathy and tends to affect young to middle-aged males in larger breeds.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Salukis, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for cardiac (heart) and thyroid disease.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","Salukis are not suited for apartment life. They need a home with a large, securely fenced yard where they can run flat out. The ideal running area for a Saluki is 300 to 400 feet in length or width. Fences should be at least five to six feet high or a Saluki will easily jump them. Underground electronic fencing will not contain a Saluki, nor will it protect him from other animals that might enter your yard.Keep your Saluki on leash whenever he's not in an enclosed area. A Saluki was bred for hunting and has a strong prey drive. If he sees anything fast and furry, he'll pursuit it for as long as he can, disregarding any commands to come or stop.Salukis are indoor dogs and require soft, cushioned bedding to prevent calluses from forming. Place food well out of reach of the Saluki's inquiring nose. That means behind closed doors or up about seven feet.Salukis are intelligent and learn quickly, but they're also independent and can be stubborn, which makes training a challenge. To hold your Saluki's attention, keep training sessions short, fun, and interesting. If a Saluki becomes bored, he will choose not to learn. Use positive reinforcement, never harsh verbal or physical corrections.","Recommended daily amount: 1.75 to 2.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The entire body can be smooth, or the Saluki can have slight feathering on the legs, the backs of the thighs and sometimes the shoulders, and the underside of the tail. The long ears are covered with silky hair.Salukis come in white, cream, fawn, golden, grizzle and tan, black and tan, and tricolor (white, black, and tan). The pigmentation of the nose is black or liver.Salukis are a clean, low-shedding breed with no doggy odor. Brush the coat weekly to remove dead hair and distribute skin oils. Comb feathering once or twice a week to remove tangles. A wipedown with a damp cloth is generally enough to keep your Saluki clean, so bathe him only if he's dirty.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care.

Expect to brush the dog and vacuum your home daily during shedding season.The Samoyed doesn't like to sit around — he likes to be busy. Keep him active with walks, games, hikes, and canine sports.The Samoyed's characteristic smile reveals his friendly, good-natured disposition. He is especially fond of children.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store.

Females stand 19 to 21 inches tall. Males and females weigh 50 to 60 pounds.,"The well-bred Samoyed is an intelligent, gentle, and loyal dog. He is friendly and affectionate with his family, including the children, and thrives on being part of household activity.The Samoyed is not a ""lone wolf"" dog — he enjoys close association with those he lives and is mentally and physically unsuited for being left alone in a kennel or back yard. His loyalty and alertness often make for a good watchdog.At heart, the Samoyed is still a hunter. He is likely to chase after small animals that he perceives as prey. For his safety, he should always be leashed when he's not at home in his fenced yard.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Samoyed needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Samoyed puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Samoyeds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions.

Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Samoyeds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Glaucoma: Glaucoma is defined by an increased pressure in the eye, and can be found in two forms: primary, which is hereditary, and secondary, which is caused by decreased fluid in the eye due to other eye diseases. Symptoms include vision loss and pain, and treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type. Glaucoma is treated surgically or with eye drops.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred — so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Samoyed Hereditary Ghlomerulopathy: This is a genetic disease of the kidney. The condition is more severe in males who appear healthy for the first three months of life until symptoms appear. Death from renal failure usually occurs by 15 months of age. Females develop mild symptoms at 2 to 3 months of age, but do not suffer renal failure. To date, there is no genetic screening test available for Samoyed hereditary glomerulopathy, but research is ongoing.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Diabetes Mellitus (DM): DM is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. A diabetic dog will exhibit a healthy appetite, but will lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Subvalvular Aortic Stenosis: This is a heart problem is caused by a narrow connection between the left ventricle and the aorta. It can cause fainting and even sudden death. Ask your vet about detecting it and prescribing the proper treatment.Cancer: Symptoms include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.","The active Samoyed is not suited to apartment or condo life. A home with a large, securely fenced yard is the best choice. Because the Samoyed is a working dog, he needs room to romp and play.Keep him mentally challenged with ongoing training and dog sports. Allow him to become bored and he's likely to dig, escape, or chew to entertain himself. Note: The Samoyed should be kept on leash whenever he's in public; he seldom can resist the lure of small, scurrying animals.With his Nordic heritage, the Samoyed is a natural fit for cold climates, and he loves to play in the snow. Conversely, with his thick coat, he can be sensitive to heat. Do not allow him to exercise strenuously when it is extremely hot — limit high-level activity to early morning or evening when it's cooler. During the heat of the day, keep your Sammy inside with fans or air conditioning.You'll need to take special care if you're raising a Samoyed puppy. Like many large breed dogs, the Samoyed grows rapidly between the age of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders and injury. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.Additionally, don't let your Samoyed puppy run and play on hard surfaces (such as pavement), jump excessively, or pull heavy loads until he is at least two years old and his joints are fully formed. Normal play on grass is fine, and so are puppy agility classes with one-inch high jumps.Another important step in training a Samoyed puppy is socialization (the process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other dogs and people). Like any dog, he can become timid if he is not properly socialized and exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when he's young. Formal puppy and obedience classes are also recommended to teach the Samoyed proper canine manners.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Samoyed puppies need slow, steady growth. Feed a good-quality diet with 22 to 24 percent protein, and 12 to 15 percent fat.Keep your Samoyed in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Samoyed, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Samoyed has a straight outer coat and a soft, thick undercoat (often referred to as wool). It can be pure white, white and biscuit, cream, or biscuit — and sheds heavily.Maintenance can be daunting. Daily brushing is necessary when the coat is shedding; once or twice a week when it's not. He'll need bathing about once every eight weeks, or whenever he rolls in mud or something smelly (very likely). Bathing the Samoyed is a time-commitment too, as thoroughly soaking the coat, rinsing out the shampoo, and letting it dry completely is no quick process.Many owners opt to hire a professional groomer for their Samoyed. Though costly, it helps to take some burden off the owner. However, you still need to brush regularly.Brush your Samoyed's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Samoyed to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Samoyed is deeply attached to his family, and this certainly includes children. A properly socialized Sammy truly enjoys the attention and company of youngsters if they are instructed on how to treat the dog with care and respect. Due to his size and strength, a Samoyed can easily knock over a small child without even being aware of what has happened, so a responsible adult should supervise all interactions between kids and canines.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The even-tempered Samoyed also enjoys the company of other dogs. This is especially true if he has been raised with other dogs from an early age. (As in any breed, dogs of the same sex that have not been spayed or neutered may not be as tolerant of one another.)Remember, though, that the Samoyed is hardwired to chase prey. For harmonious coexistence with cats and other animals in his household, training, socialization, and a proper introduction are essential. Following that, close supervision is advised.","Samoyeds are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Samoyeds in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Samoyed rescue.National Samoyed Rescue",not available

It is important that you understand the length of time a Schipperke can live and make sure you are committed enough to provide a good life for the dog for the next 15 or more years.The Schipperke is so independent-minded he's not recommended for first-time dog owners.These are adaptable dogs who can do well in any setting, including life on a boat or in an apartment, as long as they get plenty of daily exercise and the neighbors are tolerant of barking! They do best, however, if they have a small fenced yard to run in.Schipperkes have a high energy level and will demand at least a half hour of activity every day, and preferably more.Schipperkes are considered light shedders except for twice a year, when they shed heavily. Weekly brushing keeps their coat clean, and they don't need frequent baths.Training can be challenging if it is not done with patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement, all aided by a good sense of humor.Schipperkes are naturally suspicious of strangers and can be territorial toward people and other dogs. They make excellent watchdogs.Loving and devoted, the Schipperke is an ideal family dog who adores children. They can get along with other dogs, especially if they are properly socialized, and they get along with cats extremely well.Schipperkes can be noisy and they will bark for entertainment and as an alert.Never buy a Schipperke from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.",Male Schipperkes are 11 to 13 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 15 to 18 pounds; females are 10 to 12 inches and weigh 11 to 15 pounds.,"The Schipperke is the proverbial ""big dog in a little dog's body."" He's active, confident, and curious. A closed door is simply a challenge to be overcome.The Schipperke retains his puppylike qualities — including the troublesome ones — until he's 4 or 5 years old.He loves his people and wants to please them, but he also likes to have his own way. If he's allowed to, the Schipperke will soon be running the household. Protective, fearless, and naturally suspicious of strangers, he makes an excellent watchdog and will take on anyone who seems to have evil intent.Schipperkes are selective in offering their friendship, generally limiting it to family members, with whom they create strong bonds. When it comes to training, they're mischievous and can be stubborn, but with positive reinforcement they learn quickly.Like every dog, Schipperkes need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Schipperke puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Schipperkes are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all Schipperkes will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease is a disease that affects the hip joint and results in a deformity of the hip joint ball. It starts with a decrease in the blood supply to the head of the femur bone until the bone eventually dies off and collapses and becomes deformed. The result of this deformation is arthritis or inflammation of the hip joint. It is unclear what causes Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease but it is believed the cause is either inherent or injury related. The symptoms of Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease are chewing at the hip, stiffness in the affected limb, atrophy of muscles in the limb, pain when moving, progressive lameness, and irritability. Treatment is usually strict crate rest, physical therapy and surgically removing the deformed femoral head and neck. Prognosis is generally very good after the surgery and many dogs only suffer minor lameness particularly during weather changes.Autoimmune Thyroiditis: This is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in dogs. The disease tends to become evident at 2 to 5 years of age. Dogs may be clinically normal for years, only to become hypothyroid at a later date. Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Epilepsy: This is a disorder that causes seizures. Epilepsy can be managed with medication, but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder, which can be hereditary or of unknown cause.Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Mucopolysaccharidosis Type IIIB (MPSIIIB): Also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type IIIB, MPS IIIB is a disease that is caused by a mutation in a gene. When that gene is mutated, the enzyme N-acetyl-a-D-glucoseaminidase (NAGLU) is missing. This leads to the body not being able to disassemble the molecule, heparan sulfate, which leads to a build up of the molecule. The signs of MPS IIIB usually occur between the ages of 2 and 4 years. They include tremors, difficulty walking or navigating obstacles, and difficulty balancing. There is no treatment for this disease but there is a DNA test. If a Schipperke is identified as carrying this gene, he should not be bred. Before purchasing a Schipperke puppy, make sure that the parents have the proper DNA clearances.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Schipperkes, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for patellas (knees) and thyroid, certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal, and DNA clearance for MPS IIIB.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","The Schipperke is an easy to care for and adaptable breed who should live indoors with his family. During hot weather, which he doesn't tolerate well, he enjoys lying in front of a fan or beneath a ceiling fan.He generally does well in all types of settings and families, as long as he gets plenty of daily exercise and firm and consistent guidance from someone with a sense of humor.With his high activity level, however, he may be best suited to a home with a small but securely fenced yard where he can run off some of his energy. Be aware that Schipperkes like to dig, especially if there may be a mole at the end of the tunnel.Schipperkes need at least half an hour of exercise daily, and more is better. Their people are usually tired before they are. They are always running and playing and will use your house as a racetrack when the mood strikes. Walk them on leash to prevent a sudden dash toward an interesting animal or object.Count on two daily walks to keep your Schipperke's desire for action satisfied. He'll also enjoy riding in a basket on a bicycle or cruising the aisles of the pet supply store in a grocery cart.Begin training when your Schipperke is young, and continue to reinforce lessons throughout his life. He requires a trainer who's patient and consistent and responds best to positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play.The Schipperke is known for being stubborn. Although he's intelligent and wants you to be happy, his idea of how things should be may outweigh any desire to please. Some Schipperkes can be difficult to housetrain, and crate-training is recommended.","Recommended daily amount: 1 1/8 to 1 7/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

He has a distinctive coat with a unique silhouette, giving the appearance of a slope that runs from the shoulders to the croup (the end of the back).The double coat, which comes only in basic black, is short on the face, ears, and front of the legs and of medium length on the body, with longer hair in the following areas. Behind the ears, the longer hair forms a ruff around the neck. Extending beyond the ruff, an additional layer creates what's called the cape. The longer hair across the chest and down between the front of the legs is known as the jabot. The coat on the backs of the thighs forms culottes, which are as long as the ruff. A short, dense undercoat protects the Schipperke from temperature extremes.Grooming a Schipperke is simple. Weekly brushing will help keep the fur from flying around your house, although some fuzz will always be around. He'll shed heavily, known as blowing coat, once and sometimes twice a year. During that time, a warm bath will help loosen and remove the dead hair. It takes about a month for the shedding process to be complete.The Schipperke is a clean dog with little odor. Bathe only as needed, usually after he's rolled in something stinky.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Schipperke's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Schipperke jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Schipperke to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Sturdy and energetic, Schipperkes can be loyal and affectionate companions to children. They generally get along well with children of all ages, playing gently and kindly with younger ones.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Schipperke generally does very well with cats who share his home. This acceptance is stronger if the Schipperke has been raised with cats. He can also get along with other dogs if he's raised with them, but it's important to realize that the breed is territorial and will defend its property from unknown dogs as well as people.","Schipperkes are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Schipperkes end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you're interested in adopting an adult Schipperke who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Angelsgate Schipperke Rescue and Animal EducationSchipperke Club of AmericaSchipperke Club of Canada RescueSchipperke Rescue.

Schnoodle,3,3,5,4,2,2,4,4,4,5,3,3,3,2,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,5,3,3,2,3,4,3,4,4,Hybrid Dogs,"1 foot, 3 inches to 2 feet, 2 inches tall at the shoulder",20 to 75 pounds,10 to 15 years,"The Schnoodle is a designer breed, the result of Schnauzer to Poodle breedings. There has been an increase in multigenerational breeding, but many litters are from the first generation. Designer dogs aren't true breeds — they're crosses of two specific breeds. If you're interested in a Schnoodle puppy, understand that his looks, size, and temperament aren't as predictable as those of purebreds, since you don't know which characteristics from each breed will show up in any given dog.Apartments can be good homes for the smaller Schnoodles, but the larger ones do better in a home with a fenced yard.A Schnoodle will require one or two brushings per week as well as regular ear cleaning and nail clipping. Schnoodles with Schnauzer-like coats will need to be stripped several times per year, and Schnoodles with coats like a Poodle's will require clipping every six to eight weeks.Schnoodles are considered to be non- to low shedders and may make good pets for people with allergies.Schnoodles can be high-energy dogs. They require about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day.Schnoodles can make excellent guard dogs. They are protective of their families and will defend them with their lives.Schnoodles are very intelligent and need to be mentally and physically stimulated. If they're not, they can become destructive and hard to handle.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The size of the Schnoodle depends on the size of the parents: a Standard Poodle bred to a Giant Schnauzer will produce offspring who will be the size of their large parents. If a Standard Poodle and Standard Schnauzer are crossed, than the result could be sizes ranging between both the Miniature Schnoodle and the Standard Schnoodle.This uncertainty is part of the joy of a mixed breed: the ultimate details can be a welcome surprise.There are no breed standards for the Schnoodle, so predicting adult size isn't an exact science. Like any mixed breed, the variation involved can eliminate guarantees of size. What follows are ballpark estimates, and while these are fairly reliable, don't bet the doghouse on them.There are three different variations of both Schnauzers and Poodles: Miniature, Standard, and Giant for the Schnauzer; and Toy, Miniature, and Standard for the Poodle. Mixing and matching can add up to some interesting ranges and the variety is enticing. However, most Schnoodles tend to be 20 pounds or less.Toy Schnoodles range from 10 to 12 inches in height and weigh 6 to 10 pounds.Miniature Schnoodles range from 12 to 15 inches in height and weigh 13 to 20 pounds.Standard Schnoodles range from 15 to 26 inches in height and weigh 20 to 75 pounds.","The well-bred Schnoodle is a wonderfully happy, loyal, and intelligent companion. He enjoys having fun and aims for a life filled with love and play. He's protective of his family, makes a great watchdog, and loves to participate in all aspects of family life.He can have the terrier's suspicious attitude toward people and dogs — or not, depending on the genetic dice roll. A Schnoodle can have a strong temperament but generally is loving and loyal to his people.As with every dog, the Schnoodle needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Schnoodle puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","The notion of hybrid vigor is worth understanding if you're looking for a Schnoodle. Hybrid vigor isn't necessarily characteristic of mixed breeds; it occurs when new blood is brought in from outside the usual breeding circle — it's the opposite of inbreeding.However, there is a general misconception that hybrid vigor automatically applies to mixed breeds. If the genetic pool for the mixed breed remains the same over time, the offspring won't have hybrid vigor. And if a purebred breeder brings in a dog from a different line, those puppies will have hybrid vigor, even though they're purebred.Schnoodles are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Schnoodles will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Schnoodles, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Cataracts: These cause opacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This involves the hip joint. If your Schnoodle has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels, due to improper levels of insulin. Insulin lets glucose into cells to use for energy; without insulin, the glucose doesn't enter the cells and those cells become ""hungry."" A diabetic dog will eat more food to try to compensate, but he'll lose weight because food is not being used efficiently. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin.Addison's Disease: Also known as hypoadrenocorticism, this extremely serious condition is caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison's disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and have little energy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it's easy to misdiagnose this disease until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels become high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If your vet suspects Addison's, she may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.Gastric Torsion: Also called bloat, this life-threatening condition can affect large, deep-chested dogs — so it's unlikely to be a problem for most Schnoodles, who tend to be small. But if your Schnoodle is on the large side, and had a Giant Schnauzer for a parent, this condition is worth knowing about. It's a particular risk if the dog is fed one large meal a day, eats rapidly, drinks large volumes of water after eating, and exercises vigorously after eating. Bloat is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in the stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen and is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak, with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible if you see these signs.","Although the energy level of the Schnoodle is reflective of the parents, and is therefore variable, expect to exercise your dog for about 30 to 60 minutes per day. Some require less and others requiring a bit more. Schnoodles enjoy brisk walks and make great jogging companions.Schnoodles can adapt to a variety of residences, but take size into consideration. A Toy or Miniature Schnoodle will do well in an apartment, but a larger Standard may not. Ideally, a home with a fenced yard is best for all Schnoodles. A Schnoodle should not live outside or in a kennel; they're companion dogs and do best when they are inside the house with their owners.Schnoodles can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods of time. This can lead to barking and destructive behaviors. Schnoodles aren't a noisy breed, but if they become bored or are left alone for long periods, they may begin the habit. And once that habit starts, it can be difficult to stop — so nip it in the bud.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day for the most common size of Schnoodle, weighing about 20 pounds. You'll need to feed yours less if he's smaller, and significantly more if a Giant Schnauzer is one of the parents. Check with your veterinarian if you're unsure about the feeding needs of your particular dog.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Schnoodle in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Schnoodle, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Schnoodles are low-shedding dogs and must be clipped or trimmed. The Schnoodle coat is meant to resemble a Schnauzer puppy's: soft and wavy. Generally, first-generation litters have a wavy coat that's soft in texture and remains soft throughout the dog's life.The coat shouldn't be wiry like an adult Schnauzer's nor have the tight curls of a Poodle. Second-generation Schnoodles are more likely to have either the Poodle's curly coat or the wiry Schnauzer coat; the wavy coat occurs in multigenerational breeding.The Schnoodle coat can be black, gray, silver, brown, white, apricot, sable, black and white, black and tan, and even parti-color.Men and dogs look terrific in beards, as the Schnoodle proves. Keep it clean by trimming it and making sure he doesn't carry crumbs around in it.The amount of grooming needed for a Schnoodle really depends on the coat of the individual dog. If your dog has the soft, wavy type of coat, brush once or twice a week to prevent tangles and mats. The Schnoodle will also need to be bathed on an as-needed basis to keep the coat soft. The best time to brush is after a bath. Drying the coat with a hair dryer will help prevent any mats from forming.A Schnoodle with the rough wiry coat of the Schnauzer parent will not require as much grooming as the silky-haired variety, but weekly brushing is best, with some trimming to keep it tidy and free of dead hair. A Schnoodle with the Poodle's curly coat needs regular brushing and should be clipped every six to eight weeks.No matter what coat your Schnoodle has, check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.Brush your Schnoodle's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep your legs from getting scratched when your Schnoodle enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Schnoodle to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin and feet or in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Schnoodles make excellent family pets, and they love to play with kids and be the center of attention. Both parent breeds are good with kids, but of course all puppies need to be socialized with children to be comfortable with them. Introducing a five-year old dog to your toddler is a different ballgame than introducing a puppy. But when exposed early, Schnoodles and kids get along famously.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Some are known to buckle under to the demands of the family cat, but they generally get along with other pets. Schnoodles can play hard with other dogs and aren't always the best about sharing toys (there's that stubborn Terrier streak again).Again, socialization from puppyhood makes a big difference in attitude toward other pets. Terriers are bred to go after small critters, so your Schnoodle's reaction to the family hamster depends on whether he takes after the Schnauzer side of the family or the Poodle side.","Schnoodles are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Schnoodles in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Schnoodle rescue.Poo-Mix Rescue",not available

Underground electronic fencing will not prevent them from giving chase.The Scottish Deerhound is not recommended in homes with smaller animals and pets that could be considered as ""prey."" If they are not properly socialized, and for some Scottish Deerhounds even socialization does not curb it, they will give chase whenever they see the other animal. This could result in the smaller animal being killed or injured.Scottish Deerhounds are not recommended for apartment living. Although they have relatively low activity levels indoors, they are a large dog and require lots of room to run. They require daily exercise and do best in a home with a large yard or acreage.Scottish Deerhounds should be walked on leash to prevent them from chasing a moving animal, but be aware that they can and will lift you off your feet if they do decide to take off and you're hanging on to the leash.The Scottish Deerhound is a very affectionate breed and will generally befriend everyone he meets. He gets along well with other dogs if they are large and don't trigger his prey drive. He doesn't make the best alert or guard dog because of his loving nature.Housetraining can take a bit longer with the Scottish Deerhound than with other breeds. Be patient and consistent.Scottish Deerhounds are relatively inactive inside but still need a lot of daily exercise to maintain their huge bodies. They make great jogging companions and enjoy long, long walks. Many people are surprised when their active Scottish Deerhound puppy turns into a couch potato adult.Scottish Deerhounds do very well with older children, but take into account their size and energy level when they're outdoors. Don't let a child walk a Scottish Deerhound; he won't be able to hang onto him if he decides to run after something. Regardless of breed, no dog should ever be left alone with a young child.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The average height for a Scottish Deerhound is 30 to 32 inches for a male and from 28 inches and up for a female. Males weigh 85 to 110 pounds, females 75 to 95 pounds.","The Scottish Deerhound can best be described as chivalrous. He's gentle yet strong, sensitive yet brave. Loyal, devoted, quiet, dignified, and alert are all terms that apply to this dog. He is courageous in the face of danger but never aggressive.Of course, those characteristics don't just appear. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Scottish Deerhounds need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Deerhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Scottish Deerhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Deerhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Deerhounds, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website.Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Scottish Deerhounds, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs that can lead to the death of the dog if it is administered a regular dose. This sensitivity is believed to be related to the lower percentage of body fat in this breed than other breeds. A regular dose for a dog the size of a Scottish Deerhound is generally too high a dose for the low-body-fat Deerhound. It is important to choose a veterinarian who is familiar with this sensitivity in sighthounds and will be aware of how to dose your Scottish Deerhound. If you cannot find a veterinarian in your town who is knowledgeable about sighthounds, take the time to alert them to this sensitivity to ensure that all anesthetics and drugs are properly administered to your dog.Dilated Cardiomyopathy: Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs when the heart muscle becomes very thin and is unable to contract normally. Because the heart must work harder, it becomes enlarged. Dogs with this disease have an abnormal heart rhythm and show signs of heart failure, including weakness, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression, collapse, difficulty breathing, a soft cough, and an enlarged abdomen. There is no cure, but rest, diet, and medication can help for a time.Cystinuria: This genetic disorder is caused by an inability to reabsorb cystine, an amino acid, back into the kidney tubules. This results in the formation of kidney or bladder stones, which can cause life-threatening blockages of the urinary tract, especially in males. It's identified through an inexpensive urine nitroprusside test for cystine available through the University of Pennsylvania. Medication, diet, and surgery are all options that may help. Dogs with this inherited defect should not be bred.Osteosarcoma: Most often affecting large and giant breeds, osteosarcoma is an aggressive bone cancer. The first sign of osteosarcoma is a lameness in the limb, but the dog will require x-rays to determine the cause. Osteosarcoma is treated aggressively, usually with amputation of the limb and chemotherapy.Factor VII Deficiency: Factor VII deficiency causes excessive and sometimes fatal bleeding from minor wounds and surgery. A DNA test to identify carriers of Factor VII deficiency is available. This genetic abnormality is present at birth and doesn't change, so a test at any age is accurate for the dog's entire life.Gastric Torsion (Bloat): Commonly called bloat, this is a life-threatening condition that affects large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they're fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large amounts of water rapidly, or exercise vigorously after eating. Bloat occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists. The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid himself of the excess air in his stomach, and blood flow to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is drooling excessively, and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. If you notice these signs, get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types of allergies: food-based allergies, treated by an elimination process of certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals, and treated by removing the cause of the allergy; and inhalant allergies, caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Deerhounds are especially prone to inhalant allergies. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes. The appropriate medication for inhalant allergies depends on the severity of the allergy. Ear infections are a common side effect of inhalant allergies.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.","Scottish Deerhounds are calm and sedate. They enjoy a good run or a long walk, but in the main they're more mellow than manic. They'll enjoy any game that involves chasing something, although you shouldn't expect them to bring it back.Because they're a giant breed, it's important to introduce puppies to exercise gradually so you don't damage their still developing bones and joints. Deerhound puppies need plenty of off-leash exercise in a safely fenced area to develop properly. Give them unrestricted access to a large yard so they can get out and run when the mood strikes them. Start them on walks when they're 8 weeks old and gradually work them up to a mile or more by the time they're 12 weeks old. By 6 months of age, they'll be capable and desirous of much longer walks. They should be two years old before they begin any type of jumping or running. Avoid exercising them on hard surfaces such as concrete as much as possible.In the house, they need a puppy-proofed room where they can stretch out and play, yet not do too much damage. When you're not there to supervise, confine them to it with a tall dog gate or baby gate. Long hours in a crate can damage their joints.Scottish Deerhounds are not the easiest of breeds to train and require patience and understanding. They enjoy the attention they receive when you're happy with their behavior, but all in all they'd rather do what they like. They are sensitive and won't respond to harsh treatment. Positive reinforcement with food rewards, praise, and play is the best training technique to use with this breed, and it's important to be consistent. With a trainer who's patient and has a sense of humor, they've been known to achieve advanced titles in obedience.Leash training is a must with the Scottish Deerhound. Your Scottish Deerhound must be leashed on walks or his prey drive will kick in when he sees a small animal in motion. Once that happens, nothing will matter to him but the chase, no matter how many frantic commands you shout. While it's breathtaking to see a Deerhound in action, it's heartbreaking if he becomes injured in the chase, hurts or kills the animal he's pursuing, or runs in front of a car and is killed. If you want to see him run and chase, get him involved in lure coursing.","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

In contrast, the hair on the head, belly, and breast is usually quite soft. A slight fringe of hair — not enough to be called feathering — adorns the backs of the legs. Climate affects the texture of the coat, and in the United States Deerhounds commonly have a coat that is a mix of wiry and silky hair. No self-respecting Deerhound has a woolly coat, however, which doesn't shed dirt the way the wiry coat does.The typical Deerhound wears a coat of dark blue-gray, but the breed standard — a written description of how a breed should look — says he also comes in dark gray, brindle, light gray, red fawn, sandy red, or yellow. The latter three colors are especially attractive when the dog has a black muzzle and ears, but it's unlikely you'll ever see it. Most Deerhounds come in only three colors: gray, gray, and gray. Once in a while you'll see a bit of white on the chest or toes, but the less white the better.Scottish Deerhounds shed consistently throughout the year. Brush the coat with a wire slicker brush once or twice a week to remove dead hair, stimulate the circulation, and distribute natural skin oils. Always brush in the direction the hair grows. Give a final going over with a metal comb — known as a greyhound comb — to be sure you haven't missed any tangles. You can also use the comb on the softer belly, chest, and facial hair. Using your fingers, gently pluck any long or light-colored hairs from the ears until they look velvety black.Bathe your Deerhound as needed to remove any dust, dirt, or doggy odor that's developed. A bath will temporarily make his coat feel soft, but it will regain its crisp feel in a few days. With regular brushing, he really shouldn't need a bath more than a couple of times a year unless you're showing him.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Deerhound's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails regularly if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the dog's feet in good condition and keep your legs from getting scratched when your Deerhound enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Because your Deerhound has floppy ears, you should check and clean them weekly to prevent ear infections. Gently wipe out the ear — only the part you can see! — with a cotton ball moistened with a cleaning solution recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Deerhound may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Begin accustoming your Deerhound to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult — essential with a dog this size.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Deerhounds can get along with children, but they're not really a playmate kind of dog, being more into body slams than playing fetch. They're best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. Deerhounds aren't best pleased by the poking, prodding, and pulling of toddlers and will generally stalk off rather than put up with it. Their size also makes them unsuited to life with small children; they can easily knock them over without meaning to.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away.

It's better to find a designated digging area in your backyard then fight an active and natural instinct.Scottish Terriers tend to be aloof with strangers and can be aggressive to other dogs if they are not properly socialized when young.Scotties are not low-energy small dogs. They were bred as working dogs and have lots of drive and intelligence that needs to be channelled. They need daily moderate exercise and stimulation. If you're looking for a dog that's happier sitting at your side then digging holes in your backyard, a Scottie might not be for you.Although Scottish Terriers enjoy exercise, they are not recommended as jogging companions. With his short legs, a short walk around your block can feel like a long-distance marathon to the Scottish Terrier.Behind German Shepherds and Rottweilers, Scotties have been ranked third in alarm barking. They will bark at strangers and are not the ideal pet in a dwelling or area that has noise rules.A Scottie should have a physical fence around his yard, not an electronic one. It keeps him from chasing cats, squirrels, bikes, and other moving objects out onto the street. He should be leashed on walks, because with his chase instinct, he's likely to run off after an animal or smell.The Scottie isn't suited for homes with young infants and toddlers. He's been known to defend himself against unwanted pulling and prodding.He sheds only lightly but requires significant grooming. The coat takes time to maintain, with grooming weekly or daily in the case of show dogs. It should be clipped several times a year.In terms of his size and exercise needs, the Scottie is adaptable to various types of dwellings, including apartments.To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.","The Scottish Terrier is a small, short-legged dog with a compact and sturdy build. The average height is 10 inches. The weight ranges from 19 to 22 pounds for a male and 18 to 21 pounds for a female.","The Scottish Terrier's character and personality are a bit like the lonely moors of his homeland. He's a serious guy, not particularly jolly, and he approves of dignity and reserve. He's opinionated, as well as independent and smart as a whip. He tends to be aloof (but not toward his family). A Scottie doesn't respond much to people who oooh and ahh over him while he's out and about. He's slow to accept anyone outside the family, but his devotion to his own people is legendary. He needs to live inside the house, because companionship is his mainstay. Sensitive to praise and anger, he's good at adapting to the changing moods of a household. When you're quiet, he'll be quiet (unless he sees a squirrel); when you're ready for a walk, he'll bound outdoors with you.Remember his background: he's a true terrier. If another dog provokes him, he'll fight to the end. If other dogs leave him alone, he leaves them alone.It's important, actually critical, to take your Scottie to socialization classes starting when he's a puppy. Inviting friends and family over or going to busy places with him while he's young will tamp down his general distrust of strangers. Left unchecked, that can translate into aggression when the dog is an adult — so start training your Scottie puppy from the moment you bring him home.","Scottish Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain conditions and diseases.Scottie cramp is a common disorder in Scottish Terriers and is considered harmless to the breed. The symptoms of Scottie cramp occur only when the dog is stressed or overstimulated, such as during exercise, mating, or fights. The dog will appear normal at rest but will exhibit an arching of the spine, overflexing of the rear legs, the front legs may move outward from side to side, and the dog may show a goose-stepping gait. Some dogs may temporarily loose their ability to walk or run, and those who are severely affected may have trouble walking or running when stressed. This is not a progressive disease, and Scottish Terriers live long and healthy lives with this disorder. Treatment is not necessary, but in some severe cases it has been treated with vitamin E, diazepam, or Prozac.Von Willebrand's disease is an inherited blood disorder that interferes with the blood's ability to clot. The main symptom is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other symptoms include nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines. There is no cure, and a blood transfusion from the blood of normal dogs is currently the only treatment. Research is underway for new treatments, including medication. Most dogs with von Willebrand's disease can lead normal lives. A vet can test your dog for the condition when he's a puppy. Dogs with this condition should not be bred.Craniomandibular osteopathy affects several skull bones. While a puppy is growing, the skull bones become irregularly enlarged. The symptoms usually appear between four and eight months of age. Often the puppy's jaw and glands will become swollen, and he won't be able to open his mouth. He'll drool, have a fluctuating fever every couple of weeks, and in some cases the chewing muscles may atrophy. The cause is unknown but believed to be hereditary. There is no treatment, but anti-inflammatories and pain relievers ease the discomfort. Proper nutrition is necessary, and in severe cases a feeding tube may be needed. The irregular bone growth slows and typically stops by the time the puppy becomes a year old. The lesions can regress, but a few dogs have permanent problems with using the jaw and eating. In some cases, there can be a permanent inability to move the jaw; surgery can partially correct that.Patellar luxation is a common problem in small dogs, including Scotties. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation refers to dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). In patellar luxation, the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling. The treatment is surgery.","The Scottie is active and can become destructive when bored and underexercised. He loves to go for walks, but running is not part of his plan for the day. He has to be leashed for walks because he is a hunter, after all, and he will see the squirrel but not the car.He likes water but can't swim, and that's a bad conflict. He'll sink like a stone because of his short legs and heavy body. Scotties and uncovered swimming pools are a disaster waiting to happen, which is why Scottie Rescue groups prefer not to place them in homes with pools.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Scottie doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Scottie accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Scottie in a crate all day long, however. Scotties are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Scottish, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","While many people think of them as black, Scottish Terriers can also be grey or steel, brindle, or wheaten. The wheaten ones look a bit like West Highland White Terriers, which isn't surprising given their intertwined history.The Scottish Terrier has two coats. The topcoat, or overcoat, should be hard and wiry; the bottom coat, or undercoat, should be soft and dense. Because his hair just keeps growing, he doesn't shed as much as short-coated breeds. Scotty skin dries out quickly, so don't bathe until necessary.Many believe that the Scottish Terrier is easy to maintain, but in reality the breed needs a great deal of grooming. Set up a grooming table to bring the dog up to your level if that makes it easier for you. The coat needs to be groomed weekly for a pet and daily for a show dog.A variety of tools are used for brushing a Scottish Terrier: a stiff brush, a hound glove, a wide-toothed comb for the beard, and scissors for trimming. Show dogs are groomed with a technique called stripping, in which loose hairs are pulled out. It can be done with stripping knives or by hand, and the hair should always be stripped with the lay of the hair.Your Scottish Terrier should be clipped every two months if your aim is to keep his hair short; you can do it yourself or go to a groomer. If you are keeping the hair long, trim several times a year. A Scottish Terrier whose coat gets clipped regularly has softer hair (not preferred in the breed standard) and a duller coat color. If you plan to show your Scottie in conformation, avoid clipping as it is difficult to get the hair back into the proper standard condition.Scotties have bad reactions to fleas and have been known to chew themselves bald. Brushing regularly and using a flea comb are good ideas, combined with today's preventives. Begin accustoming your Scottie to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Trim nails regularly if he doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long.Brush your Scottie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Scottish Terriers have large teeth that are close together, which is why his teeth should be cleaned frequently. If the teeth aren't cleaned, the dog can suffer from tooth decay and gum disease.Start grooming when your dog is young, and make it a positive experience filled with praise and rewards to lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult. As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","He's so good with children that he's been called a nanny — but, like any terrier, the Scottie will react poorly to his tail or hair being pulled, and he's not well suited to the noise and movements of toddlers and very young children. But with well-behaved children, he's a champion and he will appoint himself their guardian.A true terrier, he can be aggressive with other dogs, particularly those of the same sex. Although he's not a sparring dog, if he wants to start a fight or responds to another dog's challenge, it can be a real problem. He's fine with those dogs he's been raised with.Because he's a hunter, he is not well suited to smaller pets. He may or may not tolerate a cat, but he's definitely bad news around small mammals such as hamsters or rats. To him, they're fast-food snacks. It's hardwired in the Scottie to go after vermin — it's not a choice. Set him up for success by not putting him in a situation where he has to fight his own nature, because he won't.","Scottish Terriers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Scottish Terriers in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

Be sure to monitor his food intake and give him regular exercise to keep him in shape.Sealies are independent and can be stubborn when it comes to housetraining. Crate training is recommended.They are reserved with strangers and make good watchdogs. Their bark is surprisingly loud and deep, but they can be trained to be quiet on command.Sealies are fond of chasing rabbits, birds, and even other dogs and cats. Be sure to keep your Sealyham Terrier on leash when he's not in a secure area.Because of their unusual looks and small size, they could be targets for dog thieves. Although Sealyham Terriers do well outdoors when it's cool (they don't like heat), they should be kept in your house when you can't supervise them.Sealyham Terriers are a rare breed. It may be difficult to locate a reputable breeder, and even when you locate one, you may have to wait several months for a litter to be born.Sealyham Terriers can be aggressive toward dogs they don't know, even dogs much larger than they are. Keep your Sealyham Terrier under control until you know that both he and the other dog are friendly to each other.Although loyal and affectionate with their families, Sealyham Terriers can be a bit reserved around strangers.Sealyham Terriers are happy little dogs, but they can have a dominant personality if not kept in check by a firm, consistent master.Sealyham Terriers have an independent, stubborn streak. Successfully training them requires firm, consistent handling. They respond well to positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play.Never buy a Sealyham Terrier from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.","Average height is 10.5 inches at the shoulder. Males typically weigh 23 to 24 pounds, while females weigh slightly less.","Sealies are typical terriers in that they're self-assured and inquisitive. They are more mellow and less rowdy than other terrier breeds, however, making them a bit easier to live with.Sealies are outgoing and friendly, but alert. They tend to be reserved toward strangers and are excellent watchdogs with an impressive bark. They respond well to positive training techniques and learn quickly, but their sense of humor often results in the addition of a clever twist to any command they're asked to perform, especially if they have an audience.These are proud dogs who will consider themselves full and equal members of the family and expect to be treated that way.Like every dog, Sealies need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Sealyham Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Sealyham Terriers have no significant health problems. As with any dog, however, there are some conditions and diseases that Sealyhams could be prone to, such as lens luxation and retinal dysplasia.Lens Luxation. The lens of the eye can become displaced when the ligament holding it in place deteriorates. It's sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed.Retinal Dysplasia. This is a developmental malformation of the retina that the dog is born with. Most cases are mild and there is no detectable loss in vision. Veterinary ophthalmologists can do tests to determine if puppies are affected when they are 7 to 12 weeks old. Retinal dysplasia shouldn't affect a dog's ability to function as a companion, but affected Sealyhams shouldn't be bred.Although these ailments are rarely reported in Sealyham Terriers, you still should research breeders and find those who do the appropriate tests on their breeding stock to ensure that you get the healthiest dog possible. A breeder should be able to show you certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.","The Sealyham Terrier's small size and robust build make him a good choice for city or country dwellers. He's relatively inactive indoors and can adapt to life without a yard as long as he's walked daily. If he does have a yard, it should be fenced to prevent him from chasing other animals or wandering off to go hunting.Sealyhams are rather low-key, not ""busy"" like most terriers. Due to their size, their loyalty to their families, and their preference for cool temperatures, they do best as housedogs.Like most terriers, Sealies likes to dig and bark. This dog is an independent thinker and requires firm and consistent handling, but he responds well to training with positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play.Sometimes Sealies can be difficult to housetrain, but patience and a regular schedule usually brings success. Crate-training is recommended.","Recommended daily amount: 1 1/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog.The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Sealyham Terrier in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Sealyham Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Sealyham Terriers have weather-resistant, medium-long double coats. The undercoat is dense and soft, while the top coat is hard and wiry. The hair around the face and muzzle is very long, compared to the rest of the coat. Sealies are all white, although some have lemon, tan, or badger markings on the head and ears.To look their best, Sealyham Terriers should be brushed three times a week to prevent tangles from forming in the longer hair on the head, legs, and chest. Hand-stripping — plucking dead hair to encourage new hair to grow — maintains the correct hard texture of the coat, but this can be a laborious process.Many pet owners opt to have their dog clipped instead. The tradeoff is that the coat becomes much softer and may shed more than a stripped coat, which sheds only lightly. You can learn to clip your Sealy yourself or you can take him to a professional groomer.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Sealyham's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and won't scratch your legs when your Sealyham jumps up to greet you.Begin getting your Sealyham Terrier accustomed to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","All Terriers are rambunctious, even the laidback Sealyham. This breed is best suited to families with older children who understand how to handle and interact with dogs.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how good-natured, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Sealies are generally good with other pets, including cats, especially if they're raised with them. They can be aggressive toward dogs they don't know.","Sealyham Terriers are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. If you're interested in adopting an adult Sealyham Terrier who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.

They are not purebreds like their German Shepherd Dog or Siberian Husky parents.The main colors of Shepskies are brown, black, cream, white, red, and blue. Almost never solid, their coats are generally a mixture of two or more colors.Shepskies usually have long, dense coats, and they're generally not recommended for people with allergies. They tend to shed quite a bit.Shepskies have high energy and don't do well in apartments or homes where they are left alone for long periods of time.These dogs' ancestors descend from cold climates, so they tolerate frigid weather very well.Some say the Shepsky is a cross between a babysitter and a cop, both gentle with and protective of the children in their family.","As the Shepsky is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between German Shepherd and Siberian Husky parents, you can expect Shepskies to be medium to large in size.Most weigh in at 45 to 88 pounds and range in height from 20 to 25 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be smaller or larger.","Many Shepsky lovers describe their dogs' as an active and playful breed. They are medium in size and full of energy. They hail from a long line of working parents which is why they often need jobs. Whether small or large they need to be needed.Shepskies are pack dogs and need a pack leader to help guide them. Don't be surprised if they test the limits of your position in the pack and try to take control from time to time.When this happens, it's important not to give into their pushiness. Assert yourself as leader by confirming the ground rules with clarity and consistency.Making your dog wait to eat is one of the best ways to establish your leadership role. The Shepsky will view you as the keeper of all valuable resources--food, treats, toys, and other canine assets.One thing Shepskys are not good at is being alone for long periods of time. Without the companionship they need—as well as exercise and the chance to put their intelligence to work—they become bored and frustrated. A Shepsky who's under-exercised and ignored by their family is likely to express pent-up energy in ways you don't like, such as howling and chewing.Like every dog, the Shepsky needs early socialization—exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences—when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Shepsky puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","The Shepsky breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the German Shepherd and Siberian Husky also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Shepskys suffer from include:Patellar LuxationHip DysplasiaEpilepsyProgressive Retinal Atrophy","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Shepsky's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Shepskies are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. One hour of exercise per day is a good starting point. They need dog parks and wide open spaces.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Shepsky's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as many breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","A Shepsky diet should be formulated for a medium sized breed with high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Shepsky and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.You'll need to take special care with feeding and exercising a Shepsky puppy, however. Their German Shepherd parents grow very rapidly between the ages of four and seven months, making them susceptible to bone disorders. They do well on a high-quality, low-calorie diet that keeps them from growing too fast.Don't let your Shepsky puppy run, jump, or play on hard surfaces like pavement until they're at least two years old and their joints are fully formed. It's fine for puppies to play on grass, though, and puppy agility, with its inch-high jumps, is okay.Overfeeding your Shepsky and letting them pack on the pounds can cause joint problems, as well as other health conditions. Limit treats, keep them active, and serve them regular meals rather than leaving food available at all times.","Shepsky coats are often a mix of their German Shepherd and Siberian Husky parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Shepskies are brown, black, cream, white, red, and blue. Almost never solid, their coats are generally a mixture of two or more colors.They usually have long, dense coats, and they're generally not recommended for people with allergies. They tend to shed quite a bit and you may need to pick up a RoboVac. These pups will require a few good brushes per week. Only bathe as needed so you don't strip the coat of it's natural oils. Brushing will also help to spread the oils throughout the coat.These pups are well suited for cold weather. Their Siberian Husky parentage is straight from Russia, which is about as cold as it gets.","If they're well-trained and have had plenty of exposure to kids, especially as a puppy, a Shepsky is a great companion for children. In fact, some say they're a cross between a babysitter and a cop, both gentle with and protective of the children in their family.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.

To keep your relations with neighbors friendly, it's important to train your Sheltie at an early age to stop barking on command.Expect your Sheltie to shed profusely in the spring, and sometimes at other times in the year.Shelties are extremely intelligent and like to have a job to do. They can be stubborn, however. Make training fun and allow them time to make up their own minds to do what you want them to do.Shelties have a lot of energy and need to be able to run. They thrive on activities such as agility and flyball, where they get both mental and physical exercise.Shelties have been popular family dogs for many years. Because there's a big demand for puppies, there are many poorly bred Shelties for sale. If you're looking for a puppy, make sure you find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments. To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees.","The Shetland Sheepdog stands between 13 and 16 inches tall at the shoulder, but it's not unusual for them to be over- or undersize. A typical Sheltie weighs about 22 pounds, but a large one can weigh as much as 35 or 40 pounds.","The Sheltie is intensely loyal, gentle, and sensitive. There's a wide range of personalities in the breed, from outgoing and boisterous to calm and sedate to shy or retiring.It's normal for Shelties to be reserved with strangers, but steer clear of dogs that seem overly timid or nervous. If you're choosing a puppy, it's fine if they don't always come right up to a stranger, but they should be happily curious and ready to make friends with someone who sits down on the floor with them.Whatever their personality, Shelties prefer to be with their people at all times and will follow them from room to room during the course of the day.Like all dogs, Shelties need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Sheltie puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Shelties are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Shelties will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Shelties, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, thyroid, and von Willebrand's disease and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur:Hypothyroidism occurs when the body can't maintain sufficient levels of thyroid hormones. Signs include weight gain, thinning coat, dry skin, slow heart rate, and sensitivity to cold. As hypothyroidism is a progressive condition, if you notice any of these signs, have your dog checked by your vet. Hypothyroidism is easily managed with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. Because this is a disease of middle age, asking the breeder about the thyroid status of your puppy's grandparents may give you a better idea of whether the problem occurs in the breeder's lines.Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) is an inherited condition that can lead to blindness in some dogs. It usually occurs by the time the dog is 2 years old and can be diagnosed by a veterinary ophthalmologist. Usually both eyes are affected, but not necessarily to the same degree. Those dogs with minor anomaly make fine pets and usually do not lose their eyesight. Those that are more severely affected may lose their eyesight within a few years of diagnosis. There is no treatment for CEA, but blind dogs can get around very well using their other senses. It is important to remember that this condition is a genetic abnormality, and your breeder should be notified if your puppy has the condition. It is also important to spay or neuter your dog to prevent the gene from being passed to a new generation of puppies.von Willebrand's Disease is an inherited blood disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII antigen (von Willebrand factor). The primary sign is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other signs, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines, may also be present. Most dogs with von Willebrand's disease lead normal lives, however. If you feel this is a concern, your vet can perform tests to determine if your dog has it or not. Canine hip dysplasia is a condition in which the femur doesn't fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can either be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or by using the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs that have hip dysplasia shouldn't be bred. Ask the breeder from whom you get a puppy for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and found to be free of problems. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. Medication or surgery can help.Dermatomyositis is an inherited disorder that can cause skin lesions and, in severe cases, affect the muscles. DM primarily affects Collies and Shetland Sheepdogs, although dogs in other breeds have been diagnosed. Some dogs never show any signs of the disease, but pass it along to their offspring. Signs are varied. Skin lesions may appear on the head, ears and front legs. There may be extensive hair loss and scarring on the face and ears, as well as on the legs and the tip of the tail. The only way to diagnose DM is through a skin punch biopsy evaluated by a dermapathologist. There's no test yet for dermatomyositis, which is thought to be one gene with variable expression, meaning that a dog can carry it without showing signs of it.","Although Shelties were bred to withstand harsh weather conditions, they love their people and should live indoors with them as part of the family.While they can be relatively inactive indoors, Shelties were bred to be working farm dogs and need ample exercise. They enjoy going for walks, playing fetch with the kids, and running around the dining room table. Afterward, they'll help you hold down the sofa.Because of their small size, Shelties can do well in an apartment if their people are committed to providing daily walks and playtime, as well as training them not to bark incessantly.This requires finesse. Shelties can have their feelings easily hurt by harsh treatment. Instead of yelling at your Sheltie for barking, acknowledge his alert (""Thanks for telling me about the squirrel in the yard"") and give a verbal reprimand only if he continues barking. In general, Shelties respond best to positive reinforcement such as praise, play, and food rewards.Try to keep training interesting for your dog. Shelties can become bored easily, and see no point in repeating an exercise multiple times if it was done correctly the first time.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Sheltie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Shelties have a double coat. The undercoat is short and dense, causing the longer, harsher topcoat to stand out from the body. The hair on the head, ears, and feet is smooth, but the mane and frill (the hair around the neck and on the forechest) are abundant. The legs and tail are furry as well.You'll see three basic colors in the breed, all with varying amounts of white and/or tan markings:Sable, ranging from golden to mahoganyBlackBlue Merle (blue-gray with black)A Sheltie who's more than 50 percent white or who has a brindle coat won't do for the show ring, but his color doesn't affect his ability to be a great companion.The Shetland Sheepdog's beautiful coat requires, at a minimum, a thorough weekly brushing with a pin brush. Be sure to get right down to the skin, and never brush a dry coat. Use a spray bottle to mist it as you go to prevent damage to the hair.Pay special attention to the fine hair behind the ears, which tends to tangle. If you find a mat in this area early, it can usually be brushed out with a small slicker brush.Your Sheltie will need extra brushing during shedding season. Males and spayed females generally shed once a year, while unspayed females shed twice a year, a couple of months after each estrus period.A proper Sheltie coat — a harsh outer coat and soft undercoat — sheds dirt and repels water, so Shelties need baths only when they get really dirty, which varies from dog to dog.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Sheltie enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Dental hygiene is also important. Brush your Sheltie's teeth at least two or three times a week to keep his breath fresh and prevent tartar buildup and periodontal disease. Daily brushing is even better.Start grooming your Sheltie when he's a puppy to get him used to it. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Shelties are excellent family companions, especially when they're raised with children who know how to handle dogs respectfully.As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch dogs. Supervise all interactions between dogs and young kids to prevent biting or ear pulling from either party. Never leave dogs and young children alone together.When it comes to other dogs, Shelties have a definite preference for their own kind, even if they don't live with other Shelties. On first introduction, they seem to recognize other Shelties as kindred spirits and are usually immediately friendly and willing to play. They tend to be standoffish with new dogs of other breeds, however. They can get along with cats, once the cat puts the Sheltie in his place for trying to herd him.","Shetland Sheepdogs are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

He is strong-willed and confident, and often has his own ideas about things. He is loyal and affectionate with his family, though tends to be suspicious of strangers.The Shiba Inu doesn't share well. He tends to guard, sometimes aggressively, his food, toys, or territory. And he doesn't always get along with other dogs, especially if he's intact. He won't hesitate to chase small animals that he considers prey.This is a smart breed, but training a Shiba Inu isn't like training a Golden Retriever. While a Golden is delighted to come when called, the Shiba Inu will come when he feels like it — or not. He's been described as stubborn, but freethinking is probably a more positive way to characterize him.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Shiba Inu needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Shiba puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Shiba Inus are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Shiba Inus will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Shiba Inus, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, including the Shiba Inu. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by elimination process of certain foods from the dogs diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Chylothorax: Chylothorax is a condition that causes an accumulation of a fluid in the chest cavity. This accumulation causes difficulty breathing, decreased appetite, coughing, and lethargy. Chylothorax can be caused by an underlying condition. Treatment includes removing the fluid, a low-fat diet or in serious cases, surgery.Glaucoma: Glaucoma is a disease that dogs and people. It is an increased pressure in the eye, and can be found in two forms: primary, which is hereditary, and secondary, which is caused by decreased fluid in the eye due to other eye diseases. Symptoms include vision loss and pain. Treatment and prognosis vary depending on the type. Glaucoma is treated with eye drops or surgically.Cancer: Symptoms that may indicate canine cancer include abnormal swelling of a sore or bump, sores that do not heal, bleeding from any body opening, and difficulty with breathing or elimination. Treatments for cancer include chemotherapy, surgery, and medications.Epilepsy: Epilepsy is often inherited and can cause mild or severe seizures. Seizures may be exhibited by unusual behavior, such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to remember that seizures can be caused by many other things than idiopathic epilepsy, such as metabolic disorders, infectious diseases that affect the brain, tumors, exposure to poisons, severe head injuries, and more.Patellar Luxation: The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, but many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland that's thought to cause conditions such as epilepsy, hair loss, obesity, lethargy, dark patches on the skin, and other skin conditions. It's treated with medication and diet.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): PRA is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, dogs become night-blind. As the disease progresses, they lose their daytime vision as well. Many dogs adapt to limited or complete vision loss very well, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Hip Dysplasia: Hip dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Tail Chasing/Spinning: Tail chasing or spinning is an unusual problem that's not well understood. It usually begins at 6 months of age. The dog is obsessed by his tail and may circle for hours. He loses interest in food and water. All attempts to get the dog to stop the behavior fail. Sometimes the dog yelps while spinning and may attempt to bite. Research suggests that spinning may be a type of seizure. Some dogs respond to treatment with phenobarbital either alone or in conjunction with other medications.","The Shiba Inu is best suited to a home with a fenced yard. He is an active breed who likes to play, take walks, or jog along with you. Giving him room to roam will help him get his ya-yas out.Socialization is important with this breed. Like any dog, he can become timid or quarrelsome if he isn't properly socialized — exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when he's young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Shiba Inu puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog because he is suspicious of strangers and tends to be aggressive toward other dogs.He'll also chase small animals such as cats or squirrels that run away from him, triggering his prey drive. For this reason, he should always be on a leash when he's in outside his fenced yard.One quirk to the Shiba Inu's personality is his dislike of being restrained, even though it's required for his own safety. He doesn't like wearing a collar or being leashed. Leash training this breed takes time and patience, but is a must.Puppy and obedience classes are recommended for the Shiba Inu, not only for the lessons learned but also for the amount of stimulation and socialization it provides the dog. Work with a trainer who knows this breed. Don't be disappointed if the Shiba Inu is a difficult and strong-willed student — that's his nature. Think of it as a challenge.Housebreaking is relatively easy with this breed. Once your Shiba Inu understands the concept of where he needs to go, he will go to that area whenever he can. Crate training is a great housetraining aid that benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Shiba Inu doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't.A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your dog accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized. Never stick your Shiba Inu in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Shiba Inus aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Shiba Inu in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Shiba, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Shiba Inu has a thick double coat that gives him a Teddy Bear look. The outer coat is stiff and straight, and the undercoat is soft and thick. He sheds moderately throughout the year and heavily twice a year when he ""blows"" coat (imagine a snowstorm — but on your furniture and clothing).The Shiba Inu coat comes in orange-red, urajiro (cream to white ventral color), and sesame (black-tipped hairs on a rich red background). Sometimes, there are white markings on the tip of the tail and on the forelegs and hind legs.The Shiba Inu is fairly easy to maintain when it comes to grooming. He is a naturally clean and odor-free dog. He does need brushing to remove dead hair and distribute oils once a week, or more often when he's shedding heavily. A bath now and then is necessary, too, but not too often because over-bathing will dry out his skin and coat. Many owners bathe the Shiba Inu every three to four months.Brush your Shiba's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Shiba Inu to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Shiba Inu is a good family dog, as long as he is raised properly and receives training and proper socialization when he's young. He gets along with children who treat him kindly and respectfully.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Early training and socialization go a long way in helping the Shiba Inu get along with other dogs and animals, but it's not a guarantee. He can be aggressive toward other dogs and he will chase animals he perceives as prey. Training and keeping him on leash are the best ways to manage the Shiba Inu with other dogs and animals.","Shiba Inus are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Shibas in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Shiba rescue.National Shiba Club of America Rescue",not available

They are not purebreds like their Shih Tzu or Poodle parents.Shih-Poo coats can be curly like their Poodle parent, straight like their Shih-Tzu parent, or a combination of the two. They are generally considered hypoallergenic.Shih-Poos can come in black, white, brown, brindle, and all variations and color combinations.Like most small dogs, Shih-Poos can be prone to dental health issues. Maintain proper dental hygiene for your Shih-Poo.Shih-Poos are pretty versatile and can live in just about any kind of home. They're happy to engage in active play or take a snooze on their humans' laps.","As the Shih-Poo is a relatively new breed, the size is not precise. That said, as a mix between Shih-Tzu and Toy Poodle parents, you can expect the Shih-Poo to be on the small sideMost weigh in at eight to 18 pounds and range in height from eight to 18 inches. As Poodle and Shih Tzu size can vary between teacup, miniature and standard, the size of the Shih-Poo will also vary.","The Shih-Poo will inherit characteristics from both parent breeds. For a good understanding of them, it's a great idea to learn all about their Shih Tzu and Poodle parents.Shih Tzus can be stubborn, but what they lack in trainability, they make up for in personality ten fold. They are incredibly friendly, attentive, and cute, while Poodles are intelligent, trainable, and active.Shih-Poo personalities can vary but typically will fall in the middle of parental traits. Most Shih-Poos are described as friendly and playful. They are the size of your average lap dog, and their moderate energy level means they'd probably enjoy napping in your lap for hours. While Shih-Poos enjoy a good siesta, they also enjoy walks and thrive on playtime. They may not be eager to learn new tricks but do enjoy interaction and attention.Shih-Poos may not be as barky as their Poodle parent, but may alert you to any displeasures, such as a missed meal, with a single bark until every few minutes until needs are met.Training and socialization should be established early on. Consistency and positive reinforcement are the ways to go with Shih-Poos.","While many designer crossbreeds have improved overall health, they can inherit health issues their parents are prone to. That said, Shih-Poos can typically live approximately 16 years on average in relatively great health.Inheriting Shih-Tzus' short snouts can give the Shih-Poo breathing issues, so if the pup inherited a longer snout from the Poodle, some of these issues will be alleviated. Watch for signs of heat stroke if your dog happens to have a shorter snout.As a small dog, they can be prone to dental problems. Maintain good dental care and have their teeth regularly checked and professionally cleaned.","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Shih-Poo's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Make sure Shih-Poos are kept on a dietary schedule. Do not allow free-feeding as they will overeat and rapidly gain weight. They will need regular potty breaks and one or two ten-to-15 minute walks a day for optimal health.Dental issues can be problematic. Regular teeth cleanings are recommended, as well as systematic dental chews and teeth brushings. Your vet should be able to help you establish a routine.Shih-Poo ears should be kept clean and dry. After bathing, take extra steps to ensure this. If your pup gets a smelly, pungent odor, they may have an ear infection. Ear cleaning solution can help keep your pup from getting infections and unnecessary trips to the vet.","An ideal Shih-Poo diet should be formulated for a small-sized breed with medium energy.High quality food is recommended, as they do tend to have dental issues. They should not be allowed to free feed as they may gain weight. A feeding schedule is ideal with a minimum of treats.As with all dogs, the Shih Poo's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Shih-Poo's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Shih-Poo coats may vary. They can get the curly fur from their Poodle parent, the straight fur from their Shih-Tzu parent, or a combination of the two, which is most likely.The color will vary, as well. They can come in black, white, brown, brindle, and all variations and color combinations.Daily brushings, as well as monthly groomings, will help keep your pup looking and feeling their very best. You may also want to give them a few baths in between, but not more than weekly, as their skin and coat can get dry and irritated.","Because the Shih-Poo is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Shih-Poos prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Shih-Poo can make a great companion.When it comes to other pets, Shih-Poos can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early.Shih-Poos can be left alone for short periods of time, but a second dog could be ideal for them, especially in their later years.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Shih-Poos because they are a mixed breed.

These are simply marketing terms used by unscrupulous breeders use to indicate a very small or large Shih Tzu.Shih Tzus are difficult to housebreak. Be consistent, and do not allow a puppy to roam the house unsupervised until they are completely trained. Crate training is helpful.The flat shape of the Shih Tzu's face makes them susceptible to heat stroke, because the air going into the lungs isn't cooled as efficiently as it is among longer-nosed breeds. They should be kept indoors in air-conditioning rooms during hot weather.Be prepared to brush and comb the Shih Tzu coat every day. It mats easily.While Shih Tzus are trustworthy with children, they're not the best choice for families with toddlers or very young children because their small size puts them at risk for unintentional injury.The Shih Tzu tends to wheeze and snore, and can be prone to dental problems.While dogs of any breed may eat their own or other animals' feces (coprophagia), the Shih Tzu seems especially prone to this behavior. The best way to handle the problem is never let it become a habit. Watch your Shih Tzu closely and clean up poop right away.",Males and females alike stand at nine to ten and a half inches tall and weigh nine to 16 pounds.,"All dog breeds have a purpose. Historically, the purpose of the Shih Tzu was to be a companion--and that's just what they want to be. They simply desire to be with you. So don't expect them to hunt, guard, or retrieve; that's not their style.Affection is their dominant characteristic, and your lap is their favorite destination. They're happiest when they're with their family, giving and receiving attention.That said, the Shih Tzu is not a total couch potato. They're alert and lively and may bark at newcomers to their home. Don't worry, though; they'll make friends with your guests the minute they walk inside.","Shih Tzus are generally healthy, but like all breeds of dogs, they're prone to certain conditions and diseases:Allergies are a common ailment in dogs. There are three main types: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, or other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, or mildew. Treatment may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Canine hip dysplasia, an abnormal formation of the hip socket that can cause pain and lameness.Patellar luxation, which means dislocation (luxation) of the kneecap (patella). The knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling.Juvenile renal dysplasia (JRD) is a genetic defect of the kidneys seen in young dogs. The dog is excessively thirsty and urinates frequently. They lose weight, vomits, and lack vigor. Currently, there is only one definitive test for the disease that can be performed on breeding dogs--a wide-wedge biopsy of the kidney, which is very invasive and carries a lot of risk. There have been swab tests developed by geneticists, but, to this date, none of them appear to be 100 percent reliable.Bladder stones and bladder infections can be caused by many factors, such as excessive protein, magnesium, and phosphorus in the diet, or long periods of time between urination. Bladder infections can be caused by bacterial or viral infections. If your Shih Tzu needs to urinate frequently, has bloody urine, seems to have difficulty urinating, or suffers a loss of appetite, take them to the vet for a checkup.Eye problems are not uncommon among Shih Tzus because their large eyes bulge. Disorders include keratitis, an inflammation of the cornea that can lead to a corneal ulcer and blindness; proptosis, when the eyeball is dislodged from the eye socket and the eyelids clamp behind the eyeball; distichiasis, an abnormal growth of eyelashes on the margin of the eye, resulting in the eyelashes rubbing against the eye; ectopia cilia, a condition similar to distichiasis; progressive retinal atrophy, a degenerative disease of the retinal visual cells that progresses to blindness; and dry eye (keratoconjunctivitis sicca), a dryness of the cornea and the conjunctiva. Contact your vet right away if you notice any redness, irritation, or excessive tearing.Ear infections strike the Shih Tzu because their drop ears create a dark, warm ear canal--a perfect environment for infection. Check and clean the ears weekly to avoid problems.Retained baby teeth and tooth and gum problems are not unusual because the Shih Tzu's baby teeth may remain intact when the permanent teeth emerge. Sometimes it is necessary for the veterinarian to extract the baby teeth. Because of the Shih Tzu's undershot jaw, they also can have missing or misaligned teeth. It's important to brush puppy teeth regularly and report dental problems, such as bad breath and loose teeth, to your veterinarian.Umbilical hernias are common among Shih Tzus. Quite often, these are caused by delayed closure of the abdominal midline. If the hernia is small, it may close as the puppy matures. Sometimes surgery is necessary to correct it, usually while the puppy is being spayed or neutered.A portosystemic liver shunt is a congenital abnormality in which blood vessels allow blood to bypass the liver. As a result, the blood is not cleansed by the liver as it should be. Surgery is usually the best treatment.Snuffles may plague the Shih Tzu because teething tends to be difficult. At about four months, the gums swell; since the gums are directly under those pushed-in noses, there isn't a lot of room. Puppies may snort, snuffle, snore loudly, or wheeze during this time, and may even have a clear nasal drainage.Reverse sneezing occurs when the dog is overly excited, gulps their food too fast, or allergens are present. Nasal secretions drop onto the soft palate, causing it to close over the windpipe. The dog makes a wheezing sound and may become alarmed. Talk soothingly to them and try to get them to relax to shorten the episode. Some say that pinching the nostrils closed so the dog is forced to breathe through their mouth is the quickest way to stop the reverse sneezing.","The Shih Tzu doesn't really mind where they live, as long as they're with you. They're a very adaptable dog who can be comfortable in a small city apartment or a large suburban or country home. They're definitely a housedog and should not be kenneled outside, though they enjoy a bit of backyard play.The Shih Tzu is content with short walks each day. They're not an extremely active dog; they're content to sit in your lap, wander around the house, play with their toys, or run to the door to greet visitors.Like other breeds with short faces, the Shih Tzu is sensitive to heat. They should remain indoors in an air-conditioned room or one with fans on hot days so they don't suffer from heat exhaustion.No, the breed cannot fly; but owners commonly report that their Shih Tzus think they can. It not unusual for a Shih Tzu to fearlessly jump from a bed or a chair. While they may not seem high to you, these heights are towering to the small Shih Tzu. And, unfortunately, these jumps often end in injury. The breed is front heavy and crashes forward, which can cause injury or even a concussion to the head. Be very careful when carrying your Shih Tzu. Hold them securely and don't let them jump out of your arms or off furniture.Even though they're naturally docile and friendly, the Shih Tzu needs early socialization and training. Like any dog, they can become timid if they're not properly socialized when young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Shih Tzu puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Shih Tzus are often considered difficult to housebreak. Most important is to avoid giving your puppy opportunities to have accidents inside. You don't want them to become accustomed to using the carpet. Some Shih Tzu owners teach their dogs to use a doggy litter box so they don't need to walk them in bad weather or rush home to take them out. A Shih Tzu puppy should be carefully supervised inside the house until they have not eliminated indoors for at least four to eight weeks. Crate training is helpful for housetraining and provides your dog with a quiet place to relax. A crate is also useful when you board your Shih Tzu or travel.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a dayNOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on their size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

A white tip on the tail and a white blaze on the forehead are highly prized.Keeping the Shih Tzu coat gorgeous is demanding. Daily brushing and combing is necessary to prevent tangles, as is frequent bathing--as often as once a week. In fact, many a Shih Tzu lover gives up and hires a professional groomer to clip those long locks short. Gone is some of their beauty, but so is the chore of daily brushing. If you trim the coat short and want to keep it that way, plan on grooming appointments every six to eight weeks.If you do groom them yourself, make the experience as pleasant as possible for both you and your Shih Tzu, starting during puppyhood. After all, you're going to be doing this a lot. When brushing, you want to make sure that you brush all the way down to the skin. Most experienced Shih Tzu groomers teach the dog to lie on their side while they brush the coat in sections; it's easier to brush that way and more comfortable for the dog.At about ten to twelve months of age, the Shih Tzu coat changes from puppy fluff to a silky adult coat. During this stage, you'll probably think the coat mats faster than you can brush. Don't give up! This is temporary, lasting for about three months. Once the adult coat comes in fully, brushing gets easier.The Shih Tzu's nails should be trimmed monthly, and their ears checked once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems. Hair grows inside the Shih Tzu's ear canal, and this sometimes needs to be plucked if the dog gets a lot of ear infections.The Shih Tuz's face, like a toddler's, also needs daily attention. They get dirty after eating, and their eyes tear up readily, so it's necessary to wipe their face regularly with a soft cloth dampened with warm water.Many small breeds are prone to dental problems, and the Shih Tzu is no exception: it's important to take good care of their teeth. Regular tooth brushing with a soft toothbrush and doggy toothpaste will keep their gums and teeth healthy.","The Shih Tzu is a wonderful family pet. They get along with other dogs or animals, and their docile personality makes them a good companion for children.Kids should sit on the floor to play with a Shih Tzu puppy, however, so there is no risk of carrying and dropping them. Children should also learn to keep their fingers away from the Shih Tzu's prominent eyes, which can be easily injured.","Many Shih Tzus unfortunately end up in shelters or in the care of rescues when people purchase them from breeders without a clear understanding of how to care for these dogs.

Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Shiranian's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Shiranian diet should be formulated for a small breed with moderate energy. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Shiranian's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Shiranian's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Shiranian coats are often a mix of their Shih Tzu and Pomeranian parents' coats and colors. The main colors of Shiranians are brown, black, sable, brindle, red, and white. Sometimes their coats are solid, though often they have a mix of their parents' patterns and colors.They usually have long coats, and they're generally considered to be a good choice for allergy sufferers. Their coats require daily brushing as well as monthly grooming. Baths should strictly be 'as needed' as they can strip the coat of its natural oils.These pups hail from royalty and aren't particularly suited for extreme weather. You'll likely need a coat in the winter for your dog, and you may need to apply sunscreen to the ears, nose, and sensitive areas where there's less fur coverage in the summer months.","Because the Shiranian is a small dog, they can be easily injured by overly excited children. Shiranians prefer to be mostly around adults or older kids who know how to play gently. That said, for children who learn early how to properly approach and play with a small dog, the Shiranian can make a great companion.When it comes to other pets, Shiranians can get along with other animals if they are introduced slowly and calmly, and early socialization will help this go smoothly. It's best if they get used to other pets early. These pups do not like being left alone, so multi-pet homes may be ideal.","It may be hard to find a breed-specific rescue for Shiranians because they are a mixed breed. However, you may want to try Shih Tzu or Pomeranian breed-specific rescues, as they often care for mixes, as well.

They'll likely need jackets in the winter and doggy sunscreen in the summer.These dogs get along with all members of the family, though they are small and can be easily injured by children who play rough. Kids should be instructed on how to play safely with small dogs and always be supervised during playtime.Shorkies have big personalities and tend to forget their own size. They won't back down from bigger dogs, so make sure to keep an eye on your pup so they don't pick fights or get injured.","As the Shorkie is a very new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size.

They are very prone to prey drive and may want to chase anything that moves, including birds, squirrels, neighbor cats, etc.Another pastime for this little pup is barking. They are quite vocal and will announce any visitors who come knocking, and when your mail carrier arrives, you will be notified, via your Shorkie.These dogs do best with early training to curb any unwanted habits. They come from a line of parents who are both known for being stubborn and difficult to house train. Make sure to start early and instill good habits. Punishment does nothing for this pampered pup; positive re-enforcement is the way to go. As difficult as it is, be careful not to spoil them too much early on, as bad behavior is very difficult to unlearn.They will love every member of the family, but will form the strongest bond with their main caretaker. Shorkies do well in just about any size family, but could be ideal for single pet households, as they demand quite a bit of attention.","The Shorkie breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Shih Tzu and Yorkshire Terrier also face.

If this occurs, you can help them by wiping around their eyes several times a day. It can make a big difference in helping to minimize the tear stains.","An ideal Shorkie diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy. You should be able to find an upscale pet food retailer near you. Look for a high quality food for your pup so they can have the best chance for a long healthy life.These dogs have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule. Usually two small meals per day is recommended. Look for healthy treats.

Siberian Husky,3,2,1,4,1,5,3,5,5,5,5,5,3,3,3,2,4,2,3,4,2,3,4,3,5,5,5,3,5,5,Working Dogs,"1 foot, 8 inches to 1 foot, 11 inches tall at the shoulder",35 to 60 pounds,12 to 15 years,"Depending on your climate, Siberian Huskies are generally low shedders except during the times of year when they blow their coat, meaning they drop large amounts of hair all at once. This happens roughly twice a year, more if you live in warmer climates, and when it does, the breed becomes a heavy shedder for about a three-week stretch.Siberian Huskies are not recommended for apartment living, but some do quite well in apartments if they are properly trained and exercised.Siberian Huskies are known escape artists and have been known to wander away and disappear. They can jump fences, break tie-out chains, slip collars and find any other way to escape. They need a high fenced yard and the fence should also be buried several inches below ground to prevent the Husky from digging his way out.Siberian Huskies can be very destructive both inside and out. If they are left uncrated inside, the breed can destroy a house and cause a wide variety of damage. Outside, they enjoy digging and will dig up yards and flower gardens alike. A dog that is given a place to dig in the yard is much happier and so are you.While they enjoy howling, Siberian Huskies rarely bark and they will not alert bark if someone comes onto your property. This makes them an unsuitable watchdog. The rap on Huskies is that they would aid a burglar before posing any threat.Siberian Huskies are not a breed for the new or timid owner. They need a strong owner who will maintain an alpha position in the home. They need obedience training from a young age and can be a difficult and stubborn breed to train.Siberian Huskies are very curious and can become injured or lost while they are exploring something new.Affectionate and good natured describes the Siberian Husky. Generally, they do well with children although young children should never be left alone with any breed. They also get along with people and do well in homes with multiple dogs.Siberian Huskies were bred to need very little food to survive. This still applies today and the Siberian Husky does not need a high level of calories per day. It is important to ask your Siberian Husky's breeder what they recommended for a serving helping and to follow their advice.Huskies cannot be allowed to run off leash during walks. They will run away and will also chase other small animals.Due to their beauty, Siberian Huskies are one of the most wrongly purchased breeds around. Many do not take into consideration their temperaments and particular quirks and are often left with an unruly, albeit beautiful, dog. Many Siberian Huskies are either lost, killed, or given to shelters due to uninformed owners. If you are thinking of purchasing a Siberian Husky, take a lot of time learning about the breed. Visit some Siberian Husky breeders or shelter dogs, read books, talk to other owners and possibly foster if you feel you can. If after all your experiences, you feel you still want a Siberian Husky, take the time to decide on whether you should adopt a rescue or a puppy. Follow your breeder's advice and remember that this beautiful dog will make your life an adventure and not always a good one.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",An average male stands between 21 and 23.5 inches high while the female averages 20 to 22 inches. The male weighs between 45 and 60 pounds and the female 35 to 50 pounds.,"Siberian Huskies are pack dogs, and they need an owner who is the clear leader of the pack. This makes training easier because you will find that your dog respects you, but don't be surprised if he tests the limits of your position in the pack and tries to take control from time to time.When this happens, it's important not to give into their pushiness. Assert yourself as leader — not by bullying or hitting — but by confirming the ground rules with clarity and consistency.Making your dog wait to eat is one of the best ways to establish your leadership role. The Husky will view you as the keeper of all valuable resources — food, treats, toys and other canine assets.This high-energy breed can be destructive both indoors and out — especially when bored or not given adequate exercise. They will demolish a house if they are left alone and there has even been a case of a Siberian Husky chewing through a cement wall.They will dig up flower gardens and yards alike, but they can be trained to dig in a specific spot in the yard. It is better for everyone if you merely teach your dog to dig in one spot instead of trying to break him of that habit.Nonetheless, they can be quite charming with their mischievous and playful nature. They are also quite social and love to show off their talents.Siberian Huskies do not bark — that's the good news. Here's the bad: they do enjoy howling, which can be very frustrating for your neighbors. Unless you have a properly trained and well-exercised Siberian Husky, they do not make ideal pets for apartments.Another caution: although Huskies are adored for being friendly and gentle, they make lousy watchdogs. Unfortunately, they are not overly suspicious of strangers, including burglars. The fact is that they tend to love everybody.Temperament doesn't occur in a vacuum. It's affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Siberian Huskies need early exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Siberian puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Huskies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Huskies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Huskies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Cataracts: A cataract is an opacity on the lens of the eye that causes difficulty in seeing. The eye(s) of the dog will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve the dog's vision.Corneal Dystrophy: This condition affects the cornea or outer transparent portion of the eyeball. It is an opacity that is caused by a collection of lipids in the cornea. It is usually seen in young adults and it generally affects more females. There is no therapy for this condition, but it does not seem to affect the vision.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.","Siberian Huskies need to be exercised 30 to 60 minutes daily to keep them from becoming bored. They make excellent jogging companions, but should not be exercised in hot weather. Surprisingly, they need only a small (but secure) backyard to expend their energy.Bottom line: Siberian Huskies need to be working to stay happy. Usually just maintaining your own active life through hiking and other outdoor sports will keep you Siberian Husky healthy, happy and out of trouble.As mentioned earlier, training is a must with this breed and you may want to invest in more advanced obedience classes. This can be difficult for many owners and trainers as the breed is very intelligent and will determine the difference between classes and home.They will behave wonderfully at class, following all instructions and commands, but at home they may revert back to the stubborn dog that stole your heart. This can be frustrating, but you will find that patience, time, and a little of your own stubbornness will pay off.Crate training is an important tool that is often recommended by breeders. It keeps you dog and puppy safe and also gives them their own safe haven to retreat to when they are feeling overwhelmed or tired. A crate should never be used as a punishment.Leash training is also a must as Siberian Huskies should never be left off leash when they are not in a fenced area. They love to run and will do so without any thought of how far away you are. You can easily lose your Siberian Husky if he decides to chase something or simply enjoy a heartfelt run. Siberian Huskies do have a high prey drive and that is another reason why they should be leashed during walks.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.When it comes to meal times, Siberian Huskies are known for being ""easy keepers"" — requiring a relatively small amount of food for their size. This trait may be traced to the origins of the breed, as the Chukchis developed these dogs to pull a light load at a fast pace over great distances in low temperatures on the smallest possible intake of food.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Husky, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Make sure your vacuum cleaner is in top working order and you book time regularly to groom if you adopt a Siberian Husky. His double coat features medium-length hair. The top coat is straight and the undercoat feels soft and dense.Expect lots of hair, lots of shedding — especially during spring and fall when they blow their coats. That said, this is a fairly easy breed to care for. Siberian Huskies living in cooler temperatures tend to shed less than those who live in warmer climates. You can avoid matting — and excess hair on your furniture — if you commit to brushing your dog's coat at least once a week during the year — and daily during shedding season.Siberian Huskies are clean dogs and will take the time to clean themselves — much like a cat will. They don't typically emit ""doggy"" odor and rarely need baths. Unless, of course, they wiggle in something disgusting in the backyard or find a stinky body of water to jump in. When it is bath time, select a high-quality dog shampoo designed to keep the natural oils in your dog's skin and coat.Huskies come in a variety of colors and markings, from black to pure white with colored markings on the body that include reds and coppers. Their eyes can be brown, blue, or a combination. Their faces sport masks that add to their eye appeal.Brush your Husky's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Husky to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Huskies make great pets for households with children. They can be very tolerant of children, but like all other dogs, should be supervised when around young children.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Siberian Huskies do get along with other dogs but it is still important to take your puppy to socialization classes. This gets them used to other dogs and also to people, although they are also very affectionate to strangers. Socialization teaches puppies how to behave and greet other dogs and their owners.Keep in mind the history of this breed. The harsh conditions in Siberia created a strong prey drive in this breed because food was often hard to find. As a result, many Huskies today maintain that prey drive toward small animals such as squirrels, rabbits, and cats. Some Huskies, however, thrive in multi-pet households, especially when they are raised with other pets from puppyhood.","Siberian Huskies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Huskies in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Husky rescue.Bay Area Siberian Husky ClubDelaware Valley Siberian Husky RescueGarden State Siberian Husky ClubHalf Moon Husky Rescue, Inc.MaPaw Siberian Husky Rescue & Referral Service, Inc.Seneca Siberian Husky ClubSiberian Husky Assist RescueSiberian Husky Club of Greater ClevelandSiberian Husky Rescue Site",not available
Silken Windhound,4,4,4,4,2,4,4,4,5,4,3,4,3,2,2,4,4,2,3,4,5,4,3,5,1,4,4,2,4,5,Hound Dogs,18 to 23.5 inches,20 to 55 pounds,14 to 20 years,"Silken Windhounds are known for their affectionate nature, even with children and other pets.This breed has a high prey drive and may chase small animals, so they need a fenced-in yard and a martingale collar that won't slip off, as regular collars tend to do with dogs that have slim head shapes.The first Silken Windhound litter was born in 1985, though the breed was not named until 1998.The Silken Windhound is not officially recognized as a breed by the American Kennel Club, though they were recognized by the United Kennel Club in 2011 and appear in shows and competitions around the world.The Silken Windhound's coat is not only beautiful and easy to groom, but it is suited for all kinds of weather. Silken Windhounds are happy to play in the winter snow or visit the beach on a warm summer day.Some Silken Windhounds carry a gene that causes them to be sensitive to medication. It is important to test for this gene before medicating your dog, as it can be fatal.Silken Windhounds have a long life span, often living well into their late teens.","Silken Windhounds can vary quite a bit in size. They tend to range from 18 to 23.5 inches in height at the shoulder. Male Silken Windhounds are larger on average than females. Males tend to weigh from 33 to 55 pounds, while females usually weigh between 20 and 45 pounds. Individuals of the breed may be smaller or larger.","The Silken Windhound makes a poor watchdog, but that's because dogs of this breed are so friendly that they are more likely to greet strangers warmly than to react with suspicion or aggression. They are known for their affectionate nature, especially when it comes to their human families, and even though all dogs should receive socialization training at a young age, Silken Windhounds are likely to take to such training more quickly and easily than many other breeds. Silken Windhounds are highly adaptable to most lifestyles and can even live in apartments, so long as they get a chance to go for at least one long walk and preferably a good run at the dog park each day. They tend to have bursts of high energy, but are happy to spend much of the day curled up on the couch with the humans they love. They have a sensitive side and don't do well when left alone without companionship for long periods of time. Most Silken Windhounds are eager to please and intelligent, which makes them easy to train, even for novice owners. Some breed enthusiasts claim that Silken Windhounds have even been known to housebreak themselves if they have enough access to the outdoors. Speaking of letting Silken Windhounds outside, it is important to give them an outdoor space that is secure and fenced in, as their high prey drive can cause them to chase small animals and wander. Owners should also rely on martingale collars, rather than traditional buckle collars, as Silken Windhounds can slip out of regular collars fairly easily. Silken Windhounds can be trained for obedience, agility, and dog sports and are very likely to appreciate the physical and mental challenge such training will provide. If they aren't properly challenged, as with dogs of any breed, they may seek out their own fun with unwanted behaviors. Overall, the Silken Windhound is a good choice for those who want a family dog that is active, affectionate, and easy to train. Even novice owners should find the Silken Windhound to be an easy-maintenance companion.","Silken Windhounds are typically quite healthy, and genetic predispositions for medical issues are relatively uncommon in the breed. Still, there are a few things that Silken Windhound owners should be on the lookout for. Lotus syndrome has been known to affect Silken Windhounds, though it appears in very young dogs and affected puppies do not survive long after birth. Some Silken Windhounds carry the MDR1 gene, which makes them sensitive to certain drugs. All Silken Windhounds should be tested for this before receiving medication, as a bad reaction can be fatal. Other issues that may affect Silken Windhounds include umbilical hernia and cryptorchidism, and older Silken Windhounds may suffer from deafness or cataracts. It is important to keep up with regular vet visits to catch any medical issues early and maintain good health.","Silken Windhounds' teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Their ears and paw pads should be checked for signs of infection, parasites, or debris and kept clean. Nails should be trimmed as needed to prevent snags and breakage. Usually a trimming once a month will keep the nails in good shape. Keep up with regular vet visits to maintain good health for your Silken Windhound.",A Silken Windhound dog diet should be formulated for a mid-sized breed with average-to-high energy and exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your individual Silken Windhound and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements.,"The luxurious, silky coats of Silken Windhounds can come in almost any color or pattern. They can be black, tan, brown, gray, red, silver, or white, or they can be a combination of colors. Silken Windhound coats may also be solid, spotted, brindle, or streaked with unique markings. Despite their appearance, Silken Windhound coats require little maintenance. They shed relatively little, and a few good brushings a week should be enough to keep the coat healthy. Some owners say they can get by with one or fewer brushings a week. They should be bathed once a month or as needed.","Silken Windhounds are typically very friendly to all members of the family, including children and other pets. They may, however, be apprehensive around children who are overly excited or make sudden, loud noises. It is important with dogs of any breed to supervise playtime with children and to teach kids how to appropriately handle animals to avoid incidents. Socialization training should begin early in life to ensure dogs are raised to interact well with humans and other pets. Silken Windhounds have a prey drive that may cause them to chase small creatures, but they generally know to be gentle with other pets in the household.","As a new breed, it is still relatively rare for Silken Windhounds to be found in rescue or adoption facilities. If you are looking for a Silken Windhound to adopt, you may try Gentle Giants, a non-profit rescue group based in California. You may also keep an eye out at your local shelter or rescue group and ask them to contact you if a Silken Windhound becomes available. Our adoption page also has available dogs for adoption listed by breed and location so you can look for a dog to adopt near you.",not available

This doesn't mean strenuous hikes or hours of retrieving, but it does mean you'll need to provide more activity than tummy rubs on the couch.Although they need exercise, they can make good apartment or condo dogs.Silkies have a strong prey drive and will chase cats, squirrels, rodents, and sometimes other dogs. A Silky may not be the best choice if you've got other small pets. Also, keep your Silky leashed when you're in unsecured areas to avoid having him disappear into the wild blue yonder when something small and furry streaks by.Silkies like to be with their families and are happiest when they can spend the whole day in your company.Despite the long coat, Silkies are fairly easy keepers. But they do require some grooming: thorough brushing two to three times a week and a monthly bath.Like all terriers, the Silky enjoys digging. To save your flowerbeds, either consider another breed, or train your Silky to dig in a specific area. It's much easier to channel the instinct than to suppress it.Barking, another terrier trait, is a much-enjoyed pastime for Silkies. Although you can teach your Silky a ""Quiet"" command, he'll still bark when he thinks it's necessary. The upside is, Silkies are excellent watchdogs.Silky Terriers can be good family dogs, but because of their scrappy personality, children should be about 10 years old and up.Although they're generally friendly, Silkies can be territorial and aggressive toward other dogs if they're not socialized properly.A Silky shouldn't be left unattended in a yard. He's small enough to be considered prey by larger wild animals, terrier enough to dig his way out, and Silky enough to get into mischief.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Males and females stand nine to 10 inches tall, and weigh eight to 10 pounds.","The Silky Terrier is a friendly, intelligent, spirited, and self-assured. True to his hunting roots, he loves to chase small animals, and won't back down from a fight. Despite his small size he makes an excellent watchdog, as he's quick to sound the alarm if something or someone strange enters his turf.Though independent, the Silky is devoted to his people and is happiest when he's part of daily family life. He likes to be in the house, following you room to room, or joining you at the front door to bark at your guests. He does best if he can be with his human ""pack"" most of the day. If you travel a lot, this adaptable dog would be happy to hit the road with you.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Silky needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Silky puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Silkys are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Silkys will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Silkys, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This involves the hip joint. If your Westie has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Diabetes Mellitus: This is a disorder in which the body cannot regulate blood sugar levels. Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination and thirst, increased appetite, and weight loss. Diabetes can be controlled by diet and the administration of insulin.Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. Epilepsy can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Tracheal Collapse: This is often seen in smaller breeds and can be seen occasionally in the Silky Terrier. It is caused by a weakening of the cartilage; the tracheal or windpipe flattens and obstructs the airway. Symptoms include coughing that sounds like a goose honk, fainting, and an intolerance to exercise. It is treated with antibiotics, steroids, cough suppressants, and using a harness instead of a collar. If medical treatment does not work, surgery is recommended.","The Silky Terrier may look like a toy, but he's a real dog who needs exercise and training. He enjoys daily walks, romping with you in the yard, or trips to a dog park with a special area for small breeds. In a pinch, the Silky is happy to take his workout indoors with a rousing game of fetch in the hallway.These are not outdoor dogs. The Silky craves the companionship of his people, and he's also small enough to be considered prey by wild animals. And despite his size, another risk is that he may fight with another dog who wanders onto his turf.When it comes to training, Silky Terriers make willing and able students. Because they're so smart, however, you need to be consistent; otherwise they'll be inclined to make up their own rules. The best way to win your Silky's cooperation is with fun lessons that use positive reinforcement.Crate training is the easiest way to housetrain your Silky, and crates are also a good way to keep your Silky safe and out of trouble when you're away from home. Silky Terriers are mischievous by nature and can be destructive when left unsupervised. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your dog accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Silky in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Silkys are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 3/4 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. Puppies need about 1/8 to 1/4 cup a day.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Base the amount of food you give on your Silky's physical condition, not by how hungry he acts. He's a con artist, and if he can trick you into doling out more food, he will. Keep your Silky in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Silky, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","This breed's coat is beautiful: long and sleek, parted down the back, and hanging five to six inches down. The color is a rich tan and various shades of blue.You might peg the Silky as a fussy breed, grooming-wise, but he really isn't. A thorough brushing and combing two to three times a week (and before bathtime), along with a bath every month or so will keep your Silky clean and tangle-free.Brush your Silky's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Silky to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Silky can be a wonderful family pet, so long as he's raised with kids and grows up around their noise and commotion. Given his strong personality, though, he's usually best for families with children older than 10 who know how to handle a dog. He may not tolerate pokes and prods from younger kids.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.The Silky gets along with other dogs very well so long as he's been raised to be dog-friendly, though there may be occasional bossiness and rivalry for attention or treats. Like all terriers, the Silky loves to chase small animals, so he may not be suited for homes with cats, rabbits, or other small pets.","Silkys are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Silkys in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Silky rescue.Silky Terrier Club of America, Inc.",not available

He's considered an average shedder.Skye Terriers can be very destructive if they are bored or are frequently left alone for long periods.Although the Skye Terrier has a moderate activity level and is quiet indoors, he still requires daily exercise. Expect at least 30 minutes of exercise each day.Skye Terriers can do well in apartments.A Skye Terrier needs a fenced yard to prevent him from running after other animals or people who pass by his property.Like many of the terrier breeds, Skye Terrier enjoys digging; after all, that's what he was bred to do.The Skye Terrier is a great watchdog.Skye Terriers can be aggressive toward dogs they don't know and will chase and kill smaller pets.Skye Terriers respond best to positive training techniques, a firm tone, and consistent expectations. They have a mind of their own and can make training difficult if they choose to.Never buy a Skye Terrier from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.",The ideal height for a Skye Terrier is 10 inches for a male and 9.5 inches for a female. Generally a Skye Terrier weighs 25 to 40 pounds.,"The Skye is brave, good-natured, and loyal to his own family. He doesn't make friends with just anyone and prefers people to take their time in approaching him. He's reserved and cautious toward strangers, traits that make him an excellent watchdog.The Skye has been called canny, a Scottish word with a variety of meanings, all of which can be applied to almost any terrier — prudent, astute, skilled, and steady. He's sensitive but not submissive with a mind of his own.He has a long memory and will remember slights or mistreatment. Skyes like to be part of the family and will become bored, wilful, and unhappy if neglected.Like every dog, Skyes need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when young. Socialization helps ensure that your Skye Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","The Skye Terrier is a very healthy breed. The only issue that's a potential concern is orthopedic problems that could occur during growth. The Skye is achondroplastic, meaning that he has a large body on small legs. If he's allowed to jump or climb excessively during puppyhood, before the growth plates in his legs have closed, he may limp or develop a condition called premature closure, which occurs when the growth plates don't close properly. Wait until he's 18 to 24 months old before taking him on long walks or letting him do any jumping or stair climbing.","Thanks to his small size and moderate exercise needs, the Skye can adapt to any environment, from apartment to country home. Regardless, he should live indoors with his people.When outside, he should be in a fenced yard or on leash so he's protected from traffic and encounters with other dogs, toward whom he's likely to express some dislike.The Skye will enjoy a daily walk or active play in the yard. Without regular exercise and training, he'll become bored and unhappy, which invariably leads to destructive or noisy behavior.Take some environmental precautions when raising a Skye puppy. The Skye Terrier has bowed front legs, which provide a curve for a deep chest. A young Skye Terrier should never be allowed to climb up stairs, or jump onto or off or furniture. Allowing a Skye Terrier to do these things when he's young can put unnecessary stress on his front legs.Train the strong-willed Skye with positive reinforcement techniques, but be firm and consistent in what you require. If your Skye thinks he can get away with disobeying you, he'll always try.","Recommended daily amount: 1 3/8 to 1 7/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The undercoat is short, soft, and woolly, covered with an outer coat of straight hair with a hard texture.On the head, Lana Turner bangs veil the forehead and eyes. (Many owners opt to hold the long bangs back with an elastic or barrette.) The Skye also sports a beard and apron (the longer hair on the chest).The Skye's coat comes in black, blue, dark or light gray, silver platinum, fawn, or cream. It's one overall color at the skin, but you may see varying shades of the same color in the full coat. He may also have black points, or markings, on the ears, muzzle, and tail tip. Puppies often have wide variations in coat color until they mature at approximately 18 months of age.The long and luxurious coat requires weekly brushing with a pin brush or long-toothed comb. A bath every two to three weeks keeps the coat clean. Be sure to brush or comb out any tangles before bathing the dog. Once they get wet, they tighten up and are more difficult to remove. If you're brushing a dry dog, mist the coat with water as you brush to prevent hair breakage.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Skye's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed.

Symptoms include weight loss, swelling of the legs or abdomen, diarrhea, increased urination and thirst, labored breathing, and kidney failure. Usually dogs with Protein-Losing Nephropathy have increased serum creatinine and urea nitrogen, as well as anemia, high cholesterol, and increased phosphorous. There's no cure, but the condition can be managed through medications and diet.Protein-Losing Enteropathy (PLE) is characterized by the loss of an excessive amount of proteins and plasma through the gastrointestinal tract. Signs include weight loss, swelling of the legs or abdomen, diarrhea, increased urination, increased thirst, and labored breathing. Usually dogs with PLE have low levels of cholesterol, albumin, and globulin. There's no cure for PLE, but the condition can be managed with medication and diet.Addison's Disease, also known as hypoadrenocorticism, is a serious condition caused by insufficient production of adrenal hormones. Most dogs with Addison's disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and have little energy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it's easy to miss this disease until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels become high enough to interfere with heart function, causing shock and death. If your vet suspects Addison's, she may perform a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.Renal Dysplasia (RD) involves abnormal development of the kidney, and can result in early renal failure. The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier has a known inherited basis for RD. Signs include increased water consumption and urination, poor appetite, vomiting, and sometimes, frequent urinary tract infections.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Wheatens, you should expect to see the results of annual blood and urine tests for kidney function and abnormalities associated with protein-losing nephropathy, protein-losing enteropathy, renal dysplasia, and Addison's disease and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","The Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier can adapt to a variety of homes, including apartments, as long as he gets enough exercise. No matter what kind of home he has, this people-loving dog should live inside, with his human family, not outdoors by himself.Give your Wheaten at least a half hour of exercise daily. This can be a couple of 15-minute walks, a walk and a good game of fetch, or practice for whatever dog sports the two of you enjoy.Begin training early, first with puppy kindergarten, then with a basic obedience class. The Wheaten has a mind of his own, and to train him successfully, you'll need to be firm and consistent — but not harsh. He responds well to positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.He'll enjoy playing with you in the yard, but make sure it's securely fenced: terriers are hunters and will take off after small animals if they're not confined. An underground electronic fence is unlikely to stop a Wheaten who's hot on the trail of something small and furry.Despite their Irish origins, Wheatens aren't fond of rain, but they relish playing in snow. Heat makes them wilt, so keep your Wheatie in air-conditioned comfort when the temperature soars.","Recommended daily amount: 1.5 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

The abundant coat covers the entire body in gentle waves, with a fall of hair over the eyes.The color is, well, any shade of wheaten, ranging from pale beige to shimmering gold. If you look closely, you might find the occasional red, white, or black hair, and the muzzle and ears sometimes have blue-gray shading.Puppies have their own distinctive look. They're born with dark coats that lighten with age. Often, the final color doesn't emerge until pups are two years old, and the coats aren't wavy until the dog reaches maturity.Being a single-coated breed, meaning he has no undercoat, the Wheaten sheds only lightly. He's often touted as being nonallergenic or hypoallergenic, but in reality, no dog is nonallergenic — they all produce allergens in the form of dander and saliva. If you're allergic to dogs, spend plenty of time around many different Wheatens to test if they trigger a reaction.You only need to bathe your Wheaten when it's really necessary. How much time you spend grooming depends on the look you want. If you want him to look like a classic Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, you'll need to groom daily. If you don't mind a somewhat scruffier look, you can get by with 10 to 15 minutes of brushing and combing two or three times a week.In either case, you'll need a stainless steel Greyhound comb, a dematting comb, a pin brush, a slicker brush, a pair of thinning shears for trimming the fall (the hair over the eyes), and a regular pair of scissors.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care.

He gets along with other pets, especially if he's raised with them. He's not above a good chase, though, and squirrels and other small, furry animals —  including free-roaming cats — had better move their tails if they stray into a Wheaten's yard.","Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers are often acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

They need firm, patient, consistent training.Staffordshire Bull Terriers are energetic dogs who need a vigorous walk or play session daily.SBTs enjoy their comforts and will readily join you on the sofa or bed if allowed.Staffords shed little, although they may have a heavy shed once a year. They require weekly brushing to remove dead hair and keep their coat shiny.The Stafford needs early socialization, especially if you want him to be friendly toward other animals.The SBT is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving.Staffords love to chew, especially during puppyhood. Provide them with tough, durable toys.Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers. Reinforce the bottom of fences with concrete or chicken wire so they can't dig beneath them.Staffordshire Bull Terriers can do well in apartments if they are properly exercised, but ideal living quarters include a fenced yard where they can play.Staffordshire Bull Terriers do not handle heat very well and need to be monitored on hot days to ensure that they don't overheat.Staffords love children, but despite their nickname of ""nanny dog,"" they should not double as a baby-sitter. Always supervise interactions between children and dogs.If properly socialized and raised with them, Staffordshire Bull Terriers can do well with other dogs and animals. It is important to understand that some Staffordshire Bull Terriers will never do well with other animals and may need to live in single animal homes.Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a strong prey drive which will send them after small animals around your neighborhood including cats.Staffordshire Bull Terriers have a high pain threshold and can become injured without any outward sign, such as whining.The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a restricted or banned breed in many cities and the number of cities restricting the breed is rising. It is important to research your city's dog by-laws to avoid the unnecessary seizure and destruction of your dog.Staffordshire Bull Terriers are extremely mouthy as puppies and can be destructive if not closely supervised.Staffordshire Bull Terriers are protective of family members, but they are not too concerned about property. They are more likely to welcome burglars than to guard the silver.Never buy a Stafford from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.","Staffords stand 14 to 16 inches at the shoulder, with males being taller. Male Staffords weigh 28 to 38 pounds; females, 24 to 34 pounds.","Loving toward people from just a few weeks of age, a proper Stafford is never shy or snarly. He is energetic and enthusiastic in everything he does and remains on alert, even in repose. This breed's temperament is described as tough, courageous, tenacious (read: stubborn), and curious. A people-loving personality makes him a good caretaker of his family, but he's less likely to be protective of property. Because he's so attentive and interested in people, however, he'll always alert you to the presence of visitors, wanted or unwanted.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parent--usually the mother is the one who's available--to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when he's young, and it should continue throughout his life. Socialization helps ensure that your Stafford puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all SBTs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In SBTs, you should expect to see health clearances on both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and elbows, and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation, certifying that the eyes are healthy.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old. The following problems may occur in the breed:Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD). This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint, eventually causing lameness or arthritis. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition that is thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Depending on the severity of the problem, your vet may recommend surgery, weight management, or medication to control the pain.Patellar Luxation: This common problem occurs when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up and often slips out of place, causing the dog to skip or hop when it happens. It is thought to be hereditary. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Hereditary Juvenile Cataracts: The development of opacity or cloudiness in the lens of the eye at an early age. This condition progresses rapidly, and dogs can be blind by 3 years of age. Surgery can sometimes partially restore vision. A DNA test is available to identify dogs that are carriers, affected, or clear of the defective gene.L-2 Hydroxyglutaric Aciduria: Affected dogs lack a particular enzyme to break down the aforementioned compound. It then builds up in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma, causing such signs as lack of coordination, muscle tremors, poor learning ability, and seizures. Signs can be treated, but there is no cure. Dogs with this condition are usually euthanized at an early age. A DNA test is available to identify dogs that are carriers, affected, or clear of the defective gene. Buy only from breeders who use this DNA test to screen their breeding animals.Skin Allergies: Also known as atopic dermatitis, this itchy, scratchy condition is sometimes seen in certain Staffords. It's not unusual for afflicted dogs to suffer hair loss or to develop sore spots on their skin. The problem is often compounded by bacterial infections. Aggressive flea control treatment can help, as can supplementing the diet with omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish oil.Demodectic Mange: All dogs carry demodex mites. The mites live in hair follicles and usually don't cause any problems, but dogs with weakened or compromised immune systems can develop a condition called demodectic mange. Also called demodicosis, it can be localized or generalized. In the localized form, patches of red, scaly skin with hair loss appears on the head, neck and forelegs. It's thought of as a puppy disease and often clears up on its own. Generalized demodectic mange covers the entire body and affects older puppies and young adult dogs. The dog develops patchy skin, bald spots, and skin infections all over the body. The American Academy of Veterinary Dermatology recommends neutering or spaying all dogs that develop generalized demodectic mange because there is a genetic link. The good news is that the mite can't be passed to humans or other dogs.","The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a companion dog who does well in any type of home as long as he gets daily exercise. He should live indoors, with access to a securely fenced yard. Like all terriers, Staffords are diggers, so it is important to reinforce fences by embedding them in concrete or burying chicken wire at the bottom to prevent escapes. Underground electronic fences are not suitable for this breed. A Stafford will ignore the shock if he sees another dog approaching his territory, and the lack of a solid barrier means that other dogs can enter the yard, which can lead to a serious fight.His short face makes the Staffordshire Bull Terrier unsuited to staying outdoors for more than a few minutes in a hot or humid climate, and he should always have access to shade and fresh drinking water. Some Staffords enjoy playing in water and will appreciate having a kiddie pool to lounge in on hot days, but others prefer to avoid the wet stuff. Staffords are not good swimmers, so take steps to protect them from falling into a swimming pool or spa.The Stafford's exercise requirements can be satisfied with two or three half-hour to one-hour walks or playtimes daily. Engage his mind with training sessions or fun activities.Begin training the day you bring your Staffordshire Bull Terrier puppy home. He is intelligent and learns quickly, but he can be impulsive and stubborn. Forget strict and formal obedience training. For best results, be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Stafford. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions. Harsh corrections can damage the dog's self-confidence and personality. Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Stafford is destructive in his attempts to entertain himself.A Stafford is not generally a barker, but he is definitely vocal. This breed will entertain you with his snorts, snores, grunts, and groans, as well as his singing voice, often described as a yodel.If you are consistent and follow a schedule, housetraining comes easily to the Stafford. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your SBT puppy from chewing on things he shouldn't or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren't around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he's feeling overwhelmed or tired. Never use a crate as a place of punishment.Leash training is also important, especially since your Stafford will be a strong puller, small size notwithstanding. Good leash manners are essential to the state of your muscles, your own happiness, and your Stafford's safety. Never walk him off leash any place that he might encounter unknown dogs or other animals. He has a strong prey drive and will give chase if not restrained.Early, frequent socialization is a must for this breed, especially if you want your SBT to be friendly toward other animals. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn't end there. Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events.With proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Stafford will be a wonderful family member who protects and loves you unconditionally.","Recommended daily amount: 1 5/8 to 2 1/4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals. To avoid gastric dilatation volvulus, also known as bloat, withhold food and water for at least an hour after vigorous exercise.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your SBT in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.","The Staffordshire Bull Terrier has a short, smooth coat that lies close to the skin. It comes in red, fawn, white, black, or blue, or any of these colors with white, as well as brindle or brindle with white.The Stafford's coat sheds annually and hair loss is minimal throughout the year. Dirt brushes out easily, and the coat dries quickly after a bath. Brush him weekly to remove dead or loose hair. Bathe as needed. This breed has little odor, so he usually doesn't require frequent bathing.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Stafford's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don't get caught in the carpet and tear.Check the ears weekly to make sure there's no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean the ears as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog's breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don't stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger.Begin accustomizing your Staffordshire Bull Terrier to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently--dogs are touchy about their feet--and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","The Stafford is suitable for families with children, but despite his much vaunted patience and gentleness, he should always be supervised in the presence of toddlers or young children. He can be rambunctious and may accidentally knock small children down.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any mouthing, biting, or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating and not to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Some Staffords get along well with other dogs and cats when they're raised with them. As adults, they may require more of an adjustment period before they welcome the company of another dog. To ensure the best relationship, choose a dog of the opposite sex. Make introductions in a neutral area away from your home.","Staffords are sometimes acquired without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other SBTs end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you're interested in adopting an adult Stafford who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Pit Bull Rescue CentralPitBulls for LifeProject Pit BullStaffordshire Bull Terrier Club of America",not available

Females are ideally between 17 and 19 inches high at the shoulder and generally weigh 30 to 45 pounds.,"The dignified Standard Schnauzer has above-average intelligence and is inquisitive, creative, and sometimes stubborn in the way he thinks. It takes an equally intelligent and creative person to stay a step ahead of him and you'll need to train him with firmness and consistency.The Standard is affectionate and protective of family members. He's territorial and will alert you to the presence of strangers with a deep bark. Once you welcome someone into your home, however, he'll accept them as well.

Socialization helps ensure that your Standard Schnauzer puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.",Standard Schnauzers have very few health problems. Nonetheless it's recommended that all breeding dogs be radiographed (x-rayed) clear of hip dysplasia and tested annually for eye disease. A breeder should be able to show you health clearances for both parents from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal.,"The Standard Schnauzer is an adaptable dog and can live as comfortably in a city apartment as on a country farm, provided he gets enough exercise each day. Whatever his environment, he should live in the home with his people. A fenced yard is highly recommended for these dogs, who has been known to jump a six-foot fence.The Standard Schnauzer needs at least an hour of vigorous activity every day. He's a high-energy dog, and should be walked briskly a minimum of three times a day, about 20 minutes each time. Or you could take him for two half-hour walks. Other good forms of exercise for this breed include swimming, playing fetch or Frisbee, and hiking.Begin training when your Standard Schnauzer is young, and continue to reinforce lessons throughout his life. He requires a trainer who's patient, firm, and consistent and he responds best to positive reinforcement techniques such as food rewards, praise, and play.Although he's intelligent and wants you to be happy, his idea of how things should be may outweigh any desire to please.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Beneath is a soft undercoat. On the back, the coat can be from 3/4 to 2 inches long.People tend to like to keep the coat on the ears, head, neck, chest, stomach, and under the tail closely trimmed, which means frequent trips to a groomer. Over the eyes and on the muzzle, the hair is left longer to form the eyebrows and beard. The hair on the legs is longer than that on the body.All furnishings (the longer hair on the head, legs, and tail) have a harsh texture. Soft, smooth, curly, wavy or shaggy hair that is too long or too short; an undercoat that is too sparse, and excessive or lack of furnishings are all considered faults in the show ring.Standard Schnauzers may be either pepper and salt or pure black. The pepper and salt coloring is a combination of black and white hairs, and white hairs banded with black. Pepper and salt coloring can range from dark iron gray to silver gray.Pepper and salt-colored Standard Schnauzers should have a gray undercoat, but a tan or fawn-colored undercoat is acceptable. It's also desirable for the facial mask to be darker and to complement the coat color. Sometimes, the pepper and salt colorations fades out to a light gray or silver white in the eyebrows, whiskers, cheeks, under the throat, across the chest, under the tail, and on the legs and belly.Black Standard Schnauzers have a dark, rich color that isn't discolored or mixed with any gray or tan hairs. The undercoat should also be black. As the dog ages or if he's exposed to sunlight a great deal, the black may fade and become a bit discolored.Standard Schnauzers require a lot of grooming to look their best. You'll need to brush the beard and legs daily to prevent tangles, and wash his face after every meal.A Standard Schnauzer's coat usually must be hand-stripped every four to six months if you show your dog or like the look and feel of the proper coat, but pets can be clipped by your groomer. Be warned, however, that if his coat is clipped, instead of stripped, the texture will soften, and he'll shed more.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Standard Schnauzer's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed.

While no dog is perfect and these ailments do not affect all Sussex Spaniels, it is imperative to do your research to find a Sussex who's been bred with health in mind. A reputable breeder will be proud to discuss the steps she's taken to prevent health problems and to show you the following health certifications for a puppy's parents: Orthopedic Foundation for Animals clearances for hips, heart, and thyroid, and certification from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) that the eyes are normal. Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old. The following conditions are among those that may affect Sussex Spaniels:Pulmonic Stenosis: This is a congenital heart disease in which blood does not flow properly through the heart due to a narrowing of the region between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. This obstruction in the pulmonary valve causes the right side of the heart to work harder, eventually enlarging. Without treatment, it can lead to heart failure. Treatment depends on the severity of the disease and ranges from regular monitoring by a veterinarian to medication to surgery.Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA): This common congenital heart disease is found in many different breeds. It occurs when a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosis, which connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery in a fetus, doesn't close after birth. If it remains open, blood begins to flow backward into the lungs, causing fluid to accumulate and resulting in labored breathing, fainting, dizzy spells, coughing, heart murmurs, collapse and heart failure. Patent Ductus Arteriosis can easily be corrected surgically.Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD): Sussex Spaniels can be prone to back problems such as IVDD, which occurs when a disc in the spine ruptures or herniates and pushes upward into the spinal cord. This may be caused by moving or being picked up the wrong way, falling or jumping off furniture, or it can be an inherited condition. A ruptured disc is painful and can lead to weakness and temporary or permanent paralysis. Treatment includes anti-inflammatory medications, acupuncture or chiropractic, and surgery.Hip Dysplasia: This degenerative disease occurs when the hip joint is weakened due to abnormal growth and development and is found in many breeds of dogs. It affects approximately 42 percent of Sussex Spaniels but is rarely debilitating.","The Sussex needs 20 to 30 minutes of daily exercise to keep him in best condition. He'll enjoy long walks or hikes, especially if they're through wooded areas where he can hunt for birds. He's a serious spaniel, not given to exuberant romps, but he enjoys spending time with his people in the great outdoors. He's best suited to living indoors but should have access to a safely fenced yard where he can keep a watchful eye on birds, squirrels, and other wildlife.Training a Sussex can be a challenge. Members of this breed have a mind of their own. Sussex Spaniels are intelligent and learn quickly, but they need consistency and patience to see the training fully succeed.One area that needs to be addressed at a young age is barking. Unlike other spaniels, Sussex Spaniels let their voices ring out when hunting. That carries over into home life as well. They will bark when people come to the door or just for the joy of hearing it. If you don't train your Sussex to bark in moderation, you will find yourself with a dog that barks at everything in excess. The Sussex is especially likely to bark and howl when left alone for long periods, so before acquiring one, consider whether you'll be home frequently enough to keep him happy.","Recommended daily amount: 2 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

To keep his weight at a normal level, feed your Sussex at specific times each day rather than leaving food out all the time. Measure food carefully, and cut back if it looks like he's putting on the pounds. He should have a waist when you look down at him, and you should be able to feel his ribs but not see them. If they're buried beneath rolls of fat, he needs to go on a diet. Dole out treats sparingly. Your Sussex will be just as happy to get a tiny-size training treat as a bigger biscuit.For more on feeding your Sussex, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Sussex Spaniel has an abundant coat that's straight or slightly wavy but not curly. The tail and the legs down to the heel (called the hock) are adorned with moderate fringe of hair known as feathering. The ears are covered with soft, wavy hair, and the neck also has additional hair known as a frill. The coat color is a rich golden liver with no other color, markings or shades of liver.The Sussex Spaniel sheds moderately.

Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Sussex Spaniels have a calm demeanor and get along well with children, especially if they're raised with them. As with most dogs, they're best suited to homes with children that are at least six years old and understand how to interact with dogs. It's never appropriate to leave dogs and young children alone together. They should always be supervised to prevent any ear biting or tail pulling on the part of either party.The Sussex generally gets along well with other pets, including cats, although he's said to be a bit bossy. If Sussex aren't socialized as pupsters, they may be aggressive toward dogs they don't know, so don't neglect this important stage of development. On the down side, a Sussex may be a little too interested in getting to know pet birds, if you know what we mean.",There are no known Sussex Spaniel rescue groups but the Sussex Spaniel Club of America may be able to direct you to Sussex Spaniels in need.,not available

All tail types, natural or docked, are equally acceptable.The Vallhund has wedge-shaped head with medium-size ears that stand erect.Swedish Vallhunds do not respond well to harsh verbal or physical corrections.The Vallhund can become a nuisance barker, especially if he is frequently left alone.The Vallhund is a herding breed and may nip at children’s ankles as they run by.The Vallhund is not necessarily a good “first dog.” He requires plenty of socialization, training, and exercise to be a good companion.",The Vallhund stands 11.5 to 13.5 inches at the shoulder and weighs 22 to 35 pounds.,"This is a confident, lively, and curious dog with an independent streak, but he’s loyal to his family and courageous in alerting them to the presence of any strangers or other perceived dangers. The Vallhund is calm and adaptable, making him suited to many different home environments as long as he gets plenty of daily exercise. He loves his people and wants to be with them as much as possible.Count on the Vallhund to keep you entertained. He is described as having a sense of humor and is clever at problem-solving or simply finding new uses for his toys.The Vallhund’s watchful nature makes him a great alarm dog. He also likes to bark just to let you know he’s in a good mood or to “chat” with you about your day. Teach him to limit his number of barks or to “speak” only on command so that he doesn’t disturb the neighbors.Begin training the Vallhund at an early age. He’s smart and loves to learn, especially if you make it fun for him. Show him what you want in a kind manner and be consistent to establish your leadership. Don’t be surprised if he “tests” you to see if you really mean what you say.The Vallhund is a herding breed, and it’s instinctive for him to nip at fast-moving objects. That’s not acceptable when he’s grabbing at a child’s pants leg, however, or chasing a bicyclist or kid on a skateboard. Correct this behavior with a stern “No” every time you see it. He will quickly learn which types of play are acceptable and which ones aren’t.Like every dog, the Vallhund needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds and experiences — ideally before he is four months old. Some Vallhunds can be shy or anxious and need extra attention to become good family dogs. Socialization helps to ensure that your Vallhund puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog, unafraid of strangers, children, other animals or being left alone when necessary.","Swedish Vallhunds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they’re prone to certain health conditions. Not all Vallhunds will get any or all of these diseases, but it’s important to be aware of them if you’re considering this breed.Expect breeders to have up-to-date health clearances certifying that a puppy’s parents are free of eye disease and hip dysplasia. Clearances should be in the form of an eye exam by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist with the results registered with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and an OFA or Pennhip evaluation of the hips. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA website or the website of the Canine Health Information Center.Retinopathy is a hereditary eye disease that is known to affect the Swedish Vallhund. It causes degeneration of the retinal photoreceptor cells and may lead to complete vision loss.  ","The Vallhund’s short legs belie his agility and speed. He corners like a race car and is an excellent agility competitor. He is sturdy and muscular and packs a big punch for his size.As a herding breed, he is bred to move flocks long distances. Even if he doesn’t do that for a living anymore, he still needs daily exercise in the form of a long walk or hike or training for a dog sport such as agility. If he gets the activity he needs, the Vallhund is happy in any environment, from city condo to country estate.With his short legs and long back, the Vallhund can be prone to back injuries if mishandled. Because their skeletal development is not yet complete, avoid letting puppies jump on and off furniture. Don’t pick them up without supporting both the front legs and the rear end.The Vallhund has a weather-resistant coat designed to withstand the harsh elements of Sweden, but that doesn’t mean he’s an outside dog. He is highly people-oriented and should never be shunted off to the backyard with little human interaction.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food daily, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Vallhund in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Vallhund, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Vallhund is a double-coated Spitz breed with medium-length hair. The undercoat is soft and dense, protected by a harsh topcoat. A woolly, curly or fluffy coat is not correct for the show ring and can be more of a hassle to groom, but it doesn’t affect a Vallhund’s ability to be a great companion.The coat comes in a sable pattern of gray to red or combinations of colors in various shades. Ideally, the dog has a mask of lighter hair around the eyes, on the muzzle and under the throat; lighter shades on the chest, belly, rear end, lower legs and feet; and darker hair on the back, neck and sides. The breed stands out for light-colored “harness markings” on the back.A Vallhund’s coat doesn’t need any special trimming. In fact, a Vallhund in the show ring is meant to appear in an untrimmed, natural state.Give the Vallhund a thorough brushing every week. Get all the way down to the skin to remove dead hair and stimulate the sebaceous glands, which produce an oily substance that lubricates and protects hair and skin.Brush your Vallhund’s teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.To prevent painful tears and other problems, trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced at trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Check ears weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Vallhund to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Vallhunds usually love children, but their herding instincts can motivate them to nip at a youngster’s feet or ankles. They can learn quickly, however, that this behavior is not permitted.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Vallhunds are usually friendly toward other pets in the household, including cats, so long as they have been socialized with them from an early age. They enjoy having a second or third dog in the family to play with, especially another Vallhund.","Some Vallhunds, purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one or given up because their families can no longer keep them, are in need of adoption or fostering. Contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Vallhund rescue organization.",Swedish Vallhund Club of America

The Mastiff's size makes him unsuited for apartment living.Tibetan Mastiffs are usually active in the morning and evening. If your schedule doesn't allow you to exercise them during these times, this may not be the breed for you.They are generally calm indoors.The Tibetan Mastiff should not be left to live outside. He's a companion dog and thrives in the presence of his family.Because of his protective nature, a Tibetan Mastiff should never be walked off leash. Vary his walks so he doesn't become territorial over a specific route.Tibetan Mastiffs are highly intelligent, independent, and stubborn, yet sensitive to human moods. They will become upset if you yell at or discipline your children or argue with your spouse. They enjoy your company but are never fawning.This is not the breed for people who wish to compete in dog sports such as agility or obedience.Tibetan Mastiffs who are left outdoors at night will bark to let you know they're on the job — so don't leave them outdoors at night. On the upside, they are generally quiet during the day.Tibetan Mastiffs shed little, except for once a year. a They require weekly brushing, except during their seasonal shed, when they should be brushed more frequently.The Tibetan Mastiff needs early socialization that should continue throughout his life. Without it, he can be inappropriately aggressive toward dogs and people he doesn't know. Socialization helps him learn discrimination, which is essential for a guardian breed.The Tibetan Mastiff is not recommended for a timid or first-time owner. This breed needs a confident trainer who is consistent and firm but also loving. The Tibetan Mastiff is strong-willed and will test whether you really mean what you say.Tibetan Mastiffs can become bored without proper physical and mental stimulation. This can lead to destructiveness, barking, and other negative behaviors. If you're interested in owning a Tibetan Mastiff, please bear in mind that you'll lose at least a few items to his sharp teeth before he reaches three years of age.Tibetan Mastiffs can do well with children if they're raised with them, but they can mistake the yelling, screaming, and playing of children as a sign of aggression that requires action on their part. They may not warm up to neighborhood kids. They are not recommended for homes with young children.Never buy a Tibetan Mastiff from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases and of sound temperament.",A male Tibetan Mastiff stands at least 26 inches tall at the shoulder and weighs in the vicinity of 100 to 160 or more pounds; females are at least 24 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 75 to 125 or more pounds.,"The word ""challenging"" is frequently applied to this independent, stubborn breed. He's intelligent and has a strong sense of self, expecting to be treated as an equal, not as a pet.He wants to please his people, but he also has his own agenda and must often be reminded of what he's been asked to do. The Tibetan Mastiff is a loyal family guardian who takes his job seriously and is aloof or reserved toward strangers.Early socialization that continues throughout his life will help prevent him from becoming territorially aggressive. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start.Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Tibetan Mastiffs are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions. Not all TMs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.Canine Hip Dysplasia (CHD). This is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint, eventually causing lameness or arthritis. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Elbow Dysplasia: This is a heritable condition common to large-breed dogs. It's thought to be caused by different growth rates of the three bones that make up the dog's elbow, causing joint laxity. This can lead to painful lameness. Depending on the severity of the problem, your vet may recommend surgery, weight management, or medication to control the pain.Panosteitis: Panosteitis can best be described as canine growing pains. It's an inflammation of the long bones that affects young, large-breed dogs and causes lameness, which often shifts from leg to leg. The condition usually lasts from one to six months and eventually resolves with maturity. Any discomfort can be managed with pain medication.Osteochondrosis Dissecans (OCD): This orthopedic condition, caused by improper growth of cartilage in the joints, usually occurs in the shoulder, but may also affect the elbow. It causes a painful stiffening of the joint and can be detected in dogs as early as five to seven months of age. It may require surgical repair. Because it appears to be a hereditary condition, dogs with OCD should not be bred.Canine Inherited Demyelinative Neuropathy (CIDN): This is an inherited condition that is found in Tibetan Mastiff puppies by the time they are six weeks of age. The condition affects the nervous system and causes weakness in the rear legs that eventually progresses to complete paralysis. There is no treatment, but selective breeding has greatly reduced the incidence of CIDN.Autoimmune Hypothyroidism: This common endocrine disorder, which usually affects middle-aged and older dogs, is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone. Signs include weight gain, flaky skin, and lack of energy. Once diagnosed, hypothyroidism is easily managed with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Tibetan Mastiffs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for hips, elbows, and thyroid.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than two years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old.","The Tibetan Mastiff is a companion dog who should live indoors, with access to a large, securely fenced yard where he can exercise. A small yard or dog run isn't sufficient for his needs.His heavy coat makes him unsuited to life in a hot, humid climate, although he can tolerate dry heat. During hot weather, he should always have access to shade and fresh water whenever he's outdoors.The Tibetan Mastiff's exercise requirements can be satisfied with 20 to 30 minutes of play in the yard or a half-hour walk. He'll enjoy having another dog to play with, preferably one who comes close to his size.Tibetan Mastiff puppies grow more quickly than smaller breeds, but they aren't physically mature until they're more than a year old. To prevent orthopedic damage, limit exercise to free play in the yard, and avoid long walks until your puppy is a year old.Begin training the day you bring your Tibetan Mastiff puppy home. They are intelligent and learn quickly, but their independent and stubborn nature means that strict and formal obedience training doesn't bring the best results.Be patient, firm, and consistent to develop the strongest bond with your Tibetan Mastiff. Always look for behaviors you can reward instead of punishing him for infractions.Regular training practice and social interaction will help ensure that you live together happily. A bored or lonely Tibetan Mastiff is more destructive and noisy than you can imagine.Housetraining comes easily to the Tibetan Mastiff. Crate training assists in this process and prevents your puppy from chewing on things he shouldn't or otherwise getting into trouble when you aren't around to supervise. A crate also gives him a safe haven where he can retreat when he's feeling overwhelmed or tired. A crate should never be used as a punishment.Leash training is also important, especially since your Tibetan Mastiff will eventually weigh up to 160 pounds or more and be able to pull you where he wants to go. Tibetan Mastiffs should never be walked off leash and having good leash manners is essential to both the state of your muscles and your happiness.Socialization is a must for this breed. Not only can Tibetan Mastiffs be overly dominant toward other dogs, they tend to become overly protective of their home and family. Puppy socialization classes are a great start, but socialization shouldn't end there.Visit many different dog-friendly stores, parks, and events. Invite different people to your home on multiple occasions so your Tibetan Mastiff learns that others can come onto your property and his territory.With the proper training, consistency, and socialization, your Tibetan Mastiff can be a wonderful family member who guards, protects, and loves you unconditionally.","Recommended daily amount: 4 to 6 or more cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.

The undercoat is thinner during warmer months. The hair is hard and straight, never curly, wavy, or silky.A heavy mane covers the neck and shoulders, and the tail and britches (the upper thighs) have a heavy coat and feathering. Males generally have more coat than females, including a thicker mane around the neck and shoulders.The coat comes in black, brown, gold, and blue, with or without tan markings above and around the eyes, on the side of the muzzle, on the throat, and on the lower part of the front forelegs, the inside of the rear legs, the breeches and the underside of the tail.Some Tibetan Mastiffs have small white markings on the chest and feet but nowhere else on the body. The undercoat may be lighter shades of the dominant color or gray or tan on black and tan dogs. Tibetan Mastiffs with sable or brindle coats are faulted in the show ring, but their color doesn't affect their ability to be a companion or guardian.The Tibetan Mastiff sheds little and may or may not shed seasonally, depending on the climate in which he lives. Brush him one to three times a week with a wire slicker brush to remove dead or loose hair.Be sure to check for tangles or mats in the mane, breeches, and tail, where the coat is heaviest. Bathe as needed. This breed has little odor, so he usually doesn't require a bath more than once a month.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Tibetan Mastiff's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better.Trim his nails once or twice a month, or as needed. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition and don't get caught in the carpet and tear. If the feet need to be tidied up with trimming, the best time to do it is when you are clipping the nails.Check the ears weekly to make sure there's no debris, redness, or inflammation. Clean the ears as needed with a cotton ball and a cleanser recommended by your dog's breeder or your veterinarian. Wipe around the outer edge of the ear canal, and don't stick the cotton ball any deeper than the first knuckle of your finger.Begin getting your Tibetan Mastiff used to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears.Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","The Tibetan Mastiff is suitable for families with older children, but he can be too large to safely spend much time around toddlers. He would never mean to hurt them, but he could easily knock them over or step on them.Make it a rule that children are never to run and scream in a Tibetan Mastiff's presence. The noise and activity can excite him, and he's simply too big to be allowed to chase children or play roughly with them.He may also feel the need to protect ""his"" children from other kids, especially if they're wrestling or otherwise appear to be fighting. Always supervise play so that he knows you're in charge.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party.Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Tibetan Mastiffs get along well with other dogs and cats when they're raised with them. As adults, they may require more of an adjustment period before they welcome the advent of another dog.","Consider adopting from a rescue group before going to a breeder.

They do well in homes with multiple dogs.Tibetan Spaniels thrive when they're with their families. They're not recommended for homes where they'll receive little attention or will be left alone for long periods.Barking can become a favorite pastime of Tibetan Spaniels if they're bored. They'll also bark when people come to the door or when they hear something suspicious. The upside is, they make great watchdogs.Tibetan Spaniels only need moderate exercise and are quite happy with a daily walk or free play in a fenced yard.Tibetan Spaniels must be walked on leash to prevent them from running off to explore. Yards should be fenced.The Tibetan Spaniel is fairly rare, so if you're buying a puppy, it may take a while to find a good breeder, and once you do, there may be a wait for puppies to be available.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies and who breeds for sound temperaments.",Tibetan Spaniels stand about 10 inches high at the shoulder and weigh 9 to 15 pounds.,"Trusting and affectionate toward family members, Tibetan Spaniels may be aloof toward strangers, although never aggressive. True to their heritage, they make excellent watchdogs and will bark to alert you of anything that seems unusual.Tibbies seem to be especially responsive to their people's moods and feelings. As loving as they are, however, they're independent thinkers and won't always obey, especially if they think they know better or don't see any good reason to do as you ask.As with all dogs, Tibetan Spaniels need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Tibetan Spaniel puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Tibetan Spaniels are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can get certain conditions. Not all Tibetan Spaniels will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog's been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Tibetan Spaniels, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals for patellas (knees) and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that the eyes are normal.Because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity, health clearances aren't issued to dogs younger than 2 years old. Look for a breeder who doesn't breed her dogs until they're two or three years old. The following problems are not common in the breed, but they may occur:Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. A reputable breeder will have their dogs eyes certified on a yearly basis.Patellar Luxation, also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait, sort of like a skip or a hop. It is a condition that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of patellar luxation, ranging from grade I, an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.","Tibbies are housedogs. They thrive on spending time with their people, and they're not suited to living outdoors or in a kennel. Because they may run off to explore, yards must be fenced and they should be walked on leash.Intelligent and willing to please, Tibetan Spaniels can be easy to train, but that doesn't necessarily mean they'll always listen to you. They have a mind of their own and will ignore commands if they don't feel like obeying. For best results, begin training early and be consistent.Some Tibetan Spaniels are yappy and some aren't, but they'll generally bark when someone comes to the door or when they hear or see anyone or anything unusual. With patience and consistency, you can teach them to stop barking after they've briefly sounded the alarm. If you live in an apartment with noise restrictions, however, this may not be the breed for you.Like all dogs, the Tibetan Spaniel needs reguar exercise, but he doesn't need a ton of it. Usually a good playtime in the backyard or one or two walks in a day will fit the bill.Tibetan Spaniels are generally easy to housetrain, but crate training is strongly recommended. It will make housetraining easier and keep your Tibetan Spaniel from chewing things while you're not there to supervise. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don't keep your Tibetan Spaniel locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Tibetan Spaniel is with you.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Tibetan Spaniels are affectionate and protective of children, but because they're small, they can be injured easily by rough handling, so they're best suited to homes with children who are at least 6 years old and know to be gentle and not to tease.As with any dog, always teach children how to approach and touch your Tibetan Spaniel, and supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear pulling from either party.Tibetan Spaniels usually get along well with other dogs and cats. Most enjoy having another dog as a companion.","Tibetan Spaniels are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Tibetan Spaniels end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you're interested in adopting an adult Tibetan Spaniel who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Tibetan Spaniel Club of America",not available

He'll bark when people come to the door, when he sees or hears something unusual, or just out of boredom.Tibetan Terriers require daily exercise and will enjoy a couple of 15-minute walks or one longer walk.The Tibetan Terrier can be easy to train with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees.

Gentle but fun loving, he's dedicated to his family but may be cautious or reserved toward strangers. Puppies are active and lively — what puppy isn't? — but settle down as they reach maturity.True to their heritage, they make wonderful watchdogs and will bark an alert if they see or hear anything suspicious. They don't like to be left alone for long periods, preferring the company of the people they love. Tibetan Terriers are known for adaptability and a sense of humor.Like every dog, Tibetan Terriers need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Tibetan Terrier puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","Tibetan Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be subject to certain health conditions.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Lens Luxation is an inherited disorder in which the lens is improperly positioned in the eye. The displacement can be partial or complete. It's sometimes treatable with medication or surgery, but in severe cases the eye may need to be removed.Hip Dysplasia is a condition in which the femur doesn't fit snugly into the pelvic socket of the hip joint. Hip dysplasia can exist with or without clinical signs. Some dogs exhibit pain and lameness on one or both rear legs. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. Screening for hip dysplasia can be done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs that have hip dysplasia shouldn't be bred. If your dog displays signs of hip dysplasia, talk to your vet. Medication or surgery can help.","Tibetan Terriers are adaptable dogs at home in a variety of households, from condos to castles. They should live indoors with their people, not stuck out in a backyard or kennel.Once they've matured, they are just as happy being couch potatoes as they are active family dogs. Like any dog, an adult Tibetan Terrier requires daily exercise to stay healthy and happy, but he'll be satisfied with a couple of 15-minute walks daily or one longer walk. Naturally, puppy and adolescent Tibetan Terriers are filled with energy and excitement and require higher levels of stimulation and exercise.Although it's nice for a Tibetan Terrier to have a securely fenced yard where he can play, it's not a great idea to leave him out there for long periods. A bored Tibetan Terrier is a barker, and a really bored Tibetan Terrier is an escape artist who's perfectly capable of climbing, jumping, or digging his way over or under a fence.Housetraining can take time, but you'll be successful if you're patient and give your Tibetan Terrier a regular schedule and plenty of opportunities to potty outdoors, praising him when he does so. Crate training is strongly recommended. It will make housetraining easier and keep your Tibetan Terrier from chewing things while you are away. The crate is a tool, not a jail, however, so don't keep your Tibetan Terrier locked up in it for long periods. The best place for a Tibetan Terrier is with you.TTs are generally amiable, but sometimes they have their own agenda. Keep training fun, be consistent, and use positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards.","Recommended daily amount: 1 1/8 to 1 3/8 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Tibetan Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Tibetan Terrier is protected by a double coat: a soft, woolly undercoat and an abundant topcoat with fine hair that can be wavy or straight. The long hair stops just short of the ground, enough that you can see light beneath the dog's body. The hair often falls in a natural part along the spine. The Tibetan Terrier comes in a range of colors and patterns, including white, gold, tricolor, brindle, silver, black, and more.That long coat requires daily brushing during adolescence as the coat changes to keep it free of tangles. Once the adult coat has come in, by approximately 18 months of age, you can get by with grooming one to three times a week. Grooming tools you'll need include a pin brush, a metal ""greyhound"" comb, ear powder, and a spray bottle for misting the coat.Mist the coat with a mixture of water and conditioner as you brush to avoid damaging the hair. Be sure to brush all the way down to the skin. Simply running the brush over the top of the coat won't ensure that you find and remove any mats or tangles. Check frequently for mats behind the ears, on the chest and belly, and at the areas where the legs and tail intersect with the body. Using ear powder to make the hair less slippery, pluck excess hair in the ears, and trim the hair between the footpads. After you're finished brushing, go over the coat with the comb to remove any loose or dead hair. You can also use it for the hair on the face.If all this grooming becomes too much for you, it's kinder and less work to keep your TT in a cute puppy clip. You'll both be happier. Whatever his coat length, you'll probably want to bathe your Tibetan Terrier at least monthly. He may need a bath more often if he plays outside frequently and gets dirty.Other grooming needs include dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Tibetan Terrier's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar build-up and the accompanying bacteria. Daily is better. Trim his nails once or twice a month, as needed. If you can hear the nail clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short nails keep the feet in good condition, don't get caught in the carpet and tear, and don't scratch your legs when your Tibetan Terrier enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Tibetan Terrier to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","Tibetan Terriers love kids and can match their energy levels all day long, but they're a little rambunctious for households with children under the age of 6 years.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Tibetan Terriers usually get along well with other dogs and cats, especially if they're introduced to them in puppyhood.","Tibetan Terriers are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.

While a sturdy little dog, they cannot tolerate excessive rough handling, especially as they are prone to broken legs.Terrier instinct may cause it to chase small animals, and thereby will need close supervision if outdoors off-leash with out a fence. Your dog should never be off-leash in an area where you cannot contain him should the need arise.Being terriers they may not do well with smaller pets in the household such as hamsters, mice and gerbils.They are a small dog but do not realize this; they sometimes challenge other dogs much larger than themselves. Supervised interaction with larger dogs is advisable.Beneath the cute exterior of your TFT puppy can reside the heart of a tyrant. Be sure to train your puppy early to be a responsible and well-behaved member of your family.Most Toy Fox Terriers would prefer to share your bed with you. However, jumping from such heights, especially when a puppy, can cause broken bones. Teaching your TFT to sleep in his own bed on the floor is a safer route.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",The AKC standard defines size by height. Height should be between 8.5 to 11.5 inches with 9 to 11 inches preferred. Weight ranges from about 3.5 to 7 pounds.,"Loyal, protective, and smart, the TFT loves his people and wants to be involved in everything they do. He's a superb watchdog and will alert you to the approach of guests and strangers, as well as to all the goings-on in the neighborhood. Personalities vary, ranging from couch potato to live wire.As with every dog, the TFT needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your TFT puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Toy Fox Terriers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all TFTs will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In TFTs, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Demodectic Mange: This is a skin disease caused by a microscopic parasitic mite. All dogs have Demodectic mites in small numbers in their hair follicles. In some dogs, the mites proliferate and large numbers inhabit the hair and skin causing the dog to have a moth eaten appearance. Demodectic mange may be localized in one or two spots or generalized over the entire body. Juvenile onset Demodicosis generally occurs in dogs 3 to 13 months of age. The first sign is a thinning of the hair around the eyelids, lips, corners of the mouth and the front legs. It is sometimes confused with ringworm. Adult onset Demodicosis occurs in dogs more than 5 years old and can be associated with internal disease or cancer.Patellar Luxation: This is a dislocation of the kneecap (patella). It may dislocate to the inside (medial) or the outside (lateral) of the leg or it may go both directions. It can be congenital (present at birth) or caused by an injury. Patellar luxation can be mild with few or no symptoms or severe with intense pain and limping.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: Generally a disease of small breeds, it can be confused with hip dysplasia. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease is due to aseptic death of the head of the femur. This causes wearing and promotes arthritic changes, at which point it can be difficult to distinguish if the damage was due to hip dysplasia or Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease.Von Willebrand's Disease (VWD): Canine von Willebrand's Disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Affected dogs are more likely to bleed abnormally, similar to symptoms of hemophilia. This can lead to life threatening situations in case of accidental injury, spaying, or neutering. Because it is a recessive genetic disorder, carriers will not show signs of the disease but if bred to another carrier will pass the disorder to their offspring.Congenital Hypothyroidism with Goiter (CHG): Affected puppies do not move around as much as normal pups, and their head may appear large in comparison with their body. If they survive as long as three weeks, the eyes do not open, the ear canal remains very small, and the hair coat is abnormally bristly. By two weeks of age, a swelling on the underside of the neck can be felt and it continues to enlarge. Delay in lengthening of bones in legs, spine and face causes dwarfism. Eventually, even with treatment, the goiter constricts the airway. Affected puppies usually die or are euthanized by the age of 3 weeks. Carrier status does not affect the pet that is spayed/neutered. It is only when breeding that carrier dogs pass the disease to their puppies.","Toy Fox Terriers do well in smaller living spaces such as apartments. They need little space to exercise adequately. They are definitely housedogs; they do not have the coat to live outdoors.That said, they love to explore the outdoors but should be leashed or properly supervised to prevent them getting into trouble. Their big dog attitude can often cause them to attempt to tangle with animals much larger than themselves.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.","The coat of a Toy Fox Terrier is short, fine and smooth, slightly longer at the ruff. Generally, the body of a TFT should be mostly white. He comes in several color combinations:Tricolor: mostly black head, tan markings on cheeks, lips, and eye dots, body over fifty percent white with or without black markings.White and Tan: mostly tan head, body over fifty percent white with or without tan markings.White and black: mostly black head, body over fifty percent white with black markings.White, chocolate and tan: (allowed in AKC and CKC, not UKC) mostly chocolate head, tan markings on cheeks, lips and eye dots. Body is over fifty percent white with or without chocolate body spots.Brush your TFT's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your TFT to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","They can be active, fun loving companions for older children, but like most toy breeds, they are not recommended playmates for very young children. Their small size, tendency to break bones easily, and terrier tenacity can make a bad combination with very young children.They get along well with other dogs and cats in their home, although they may be territorial toward strange dogs passing or approaching their property.","Toy Fox Terriers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Luckily, their coats are very easy to groom.Valley Bulldogs love kids and are great playmates for active older children. They may be too rambunctious for toddlers, however, and can accidentally knock them down in play. Always supervise play time.","As the Valley Bulldog is a relatively new mixed breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That said, as a mix between Boxer and English Bulldog parents, you can expect Valley Bulldogs to be on the medium to large side.Most weigh in at 50 to 125 pounds and range in height from twelve to 25 inches at the shoulder. However, being such a new breed, many can be smaller or larger depending on which parent's genes are more dominant.","Many Valley Bulldog lovers describe these dogs' personalities as ""silly."" While the Boxer tends to be more active than the English Bulldog, these pups are somewhere in the middle--usually more active than the English Bulldog but less active than the Boxer.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them.Like every dog, Valley Bulldogs need early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Valley Bulldog puppy grows up to be a well-rounded, outgoing, friendly dog and stays that way.Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly and taking your dog to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help them polish their social skills.","The Valley Bulldog breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the Boxer and English Bulldog also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues, which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Valley Bulls suffer from include:Skin ProblemsBreathing DifficultyIt's fun to spoil our dogs with treats, but keeping your dog's weight in check is one of the best things you can do for them. Chopped carrots or celery make great little healthy treats.Also, you should make sure your dog is clean between the folds of their skin to keep them from getting infections.","As with all dogs, you should keep up with your Valley Bulldog's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early. Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Valley Bulls are prone to weight gain, and they have high energy levels. Make sure your dog gets at least one good half-hour- to hour-long walk per day with a few good, active play sessions and shorter walks mixed in.Check their ears for debris and pests daily and clean them as recommended by your vet. Trim your dog's nails before they get too long--usually once or twice per month. They should not be clicking against the floor. Your groomer can help with this.Your main concern when it comes to your Valley Bulldog's care will be maintaining their oral health. You should brush their teeth daily, as small breeds are prone to dental issues. Your veterinarian can instruct you on how to brush your dog's teeth properly.","An ideal Valley Bulldog diet should be formulated for an active, medium-sized breed. They have a tendency to gain weight if they are overfed, so you should stick to a regular feeding schedule and not leave food out during the day. Limit their amount of treats, as well.As with all dogs, the Valley Bulldog's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Valley Bulldog's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Valley Bulldog coats are often a mix of their Boxer and English Bulldog parents' coats and colors.

They rarely need baths and don't have a strong doggy odor.Vizslas thrive on human companionship. They'll follow family members from room to room and like to be touching or touched by their people.Vizslas aren't recommended for people who work long hours. Vizslas can suffer from separation anxiety, which can lead to destructive behaviors.Vizslas tend to be chewers. Keep your Vizsla supplied with plenty of chew toys to protect your possessions.Vizslas do best in homes with fenced yards where they can safely run and play.Vizslas should live in the home with the family, not outside. Their coat doesn't protect them from cold temperatures and they can't thrive without human companionship.Although they aren't recommended for homes with young kids, Vizslas are very affectionate with children and can make great companions for older, energetic kids. Training and socialization is a must with this breed. They can be difficult to handle if they aren't properly trained and they can become shy and timid if they're not properly socialized.Vizslas do well with other dogs and will even get along with cats if they're raised with them. However, they're not a good fit for homes that have small pets such as rabbits, gerbils, guinea pigs, or birds.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from a puppy mill, a pet store, or from a breeder who doesn't provide health clearances or guarantees.

Epilepsy can be managed with medication but it cannot be cured. A dog can live a full and healthy life with the proper management of this disorder.Canine Hip Dysplasia is a heritable condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program (PennHIP). Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems. Hip dysplasia is hereditary, but it can be worsened by environmental factors, such as rapid growth from a high-calorie diet or injuries incurred from jumping or falling on slick floors.Hypothyroidism is an abnormally low level of the hormone produced by the thyroid gland. A mild sign of the disease may be infertility. More obvious signs include obesity, mental dullness, drooping of the eyelids, low energy levels, and irregular heat cycles. The dog's fur becomes coarse and brittle and begins to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be treated with daily medication, which must continue throughout the dog's life. A dog receiving daily thyroid treatment can live a full and happy life.Lymphosarcoma is the third most common cancer seen in dogs and can be found in various parts of the body such as the spleen, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, liver, and bone marrow. The cancer is treated with chemotherapy and approximately 80 percent of dogs treated will go into remission.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.","Exercise, exercise, and exercise, plus work in the form of canine sports or therapy work is the key to a happy and healthy relationship with a Vizsla. Give him at least two half-hour workouts daily in the form of walks, runs, or games of fetch, or he'll become destructive and hard to handle.When training the Vizsla, be consistent and kind, never harsh. He responds best to positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. For best results, begin training as soon as you bring your puppy home. A few minutes of practice several times a day will bring success before you know it.The people-oriented Vizsla should live in your home with you, not out in the yard. He needs a fenced yard where he can play safely. Keep in mind that an underground electronic fence won't protect him from other dogs that come into the yard.Being a retrieving dog, the Vizsla is mouthy and likes to chew. Provide him with a variety of chew toys and rotate them regularly so he doesn't get bored and decide to gnaw on the furniture, your shoes, or other expensive items.","Recommended daily amount: 3 to 4 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Vizsla in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Vizsla, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Dressed in various shades of solid golden rust, the Vizsla has a short, smooth coat that lies close to the body. The eyes and nose come in various shades of brown.Some breeders sell Vizslas with a woolly undercoat, coats that are longer than normal, or of a different color (dark mahogany red or pale yellow, or coats with more than a small spot of white on the forechest or toes), or a black nose. These traits aren't allowed in the breed standard — the written description of what the breed should look like — and they're a good sign that you should look for another breeder. Responsible breeders try to stick closely to the breed standard.The Vizsla is easy to groom. He doesn't have a strong doggy odor and requires only weekly brushing with a rubber curry brush and a wipe down with a damp cloth.Trim nails once or twice a month. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and protect your shins from getting scratched when your Vizsla enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Start brushing and examining your Vizsla when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.","The Vizsla is a loving dog who's friendly and tolerant with children, but his exuberance can be overwhelming for kids younger than six years old.As with any dog, teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and supervise any interactions between dogs and kids to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Vizslas get along with other dogs and can be friends with cats, especially if they're raised with them. They might be a little too fond of pet birds, if you know what we mean. Nor should they be trusted around small pets such as rabbits, hamsters, or gerbils.","Vizslas are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Vizslas end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. If you're interested in adopting an adult Vizsla who's already gone through the destructive puppy stage and may already be trained, a rescue group is a good place to start.Vizsla Canada AdoptionVizsla Club of America Rescue",not available

Be prepared to provide them with lots of exercise and mental stimulation.Weims aren't a soft-mouthed dog like a Golden Retriever and some have a low tolerance for small, furry animals, such as rabbits, and even cats and dogs. Until you know your dog well, watch him carefully when small animals are in his presence.Weims are high-strung dogs and can suffer from severe separation anxiety. If left alone for too long, they may bark, become destructive, or even injure themselves.Although Weimaraners are hunting dogs, they don't like living outdoors. They require a lot of attention and want to be close to you.Weims often are suspicious of strangers and can be unacceptably aggressive. Socializing them to many different people and situations when they are puppies and throughout their lives is critical.Weimaraners are intelligent and they think for themselves. Firm, consistent, gentle training must continue throughout their lives.Weimaraners can be difficult to housetrain. Crate training is recommended.Unethical breeders may advertise blue or black Weims as ""rare"" to attract buyers and will charge more for pups of these colors, but the truth is that blue and black Weimaraners are disqualified in the breed standard.Weims are intelligent and can learn quickly, but if their intelligence and energy aren't channeled constructively, they may learn some things you don't want them to know, such as how to open doors and escape.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.",Male Weimaraners stand 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder and weigh 70 to 85 pounds. Females are between 23 and 25 inches tall and weigh 55 to 70 pounds.,"Early tales about the Weimaraner made it seem as if the dog came fully trained and was perfect in all respects. Even today, many people still hold this belief about the breed. Unfortunately for them, there's no such thing as a dog that comes programmed with good behavior.The typical Weimaraner is friendly, fearless, alert, and obedient, all traits that make him an excellent companion and watchdog. On the flip side, he's assertive, smart, restless, and willful. This is a dog who will take over the household if you give him half a chance. He'll chew, bark, chase cats, and steal the roast off the counter — if you don't give him the socialization, training, and structure he needs throughout his life.Aggression and shyness are temperament flaws that are seen in this breed. They must be dealt with early and may require the assistance of a behaviorist or experienced trainer to avoid serious behavior problems such as biting.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Weimaraners need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. For the Weim, however, socialization should continue throughout his life. Socialization helps ensure that your Weimaraner puppy grows up to be a well-rounded, outgoing, friendly dog and stays that way. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Weimaraners are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Weims will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Weims, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Hip Dysplasia: This is an abnormality of the hip joint. It may affect one or both sides. Dogs with hip dysplasia may or may not show any clinical signs. Although the tendency toward hip dysplasia is thought to be inherited, diet, rapid growth, and environment also are thought to be contributors to the condition.Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), also called Bloat or Torsion: This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and type of food might be a factor in causing this to happen too. It is more common among older dogs. GDV occurs when the stomach is distended with gas or air and then twists (torsion). The dog is unable to belch or vomit to rid itself of the excess air in its stomach, and the normal return of blood to the heart is impeded. Blood pressure drops and the dog goes into shock. Without immediate medical attention, the dog can die. Suspect bloat if your dog has a distended abdomen, is salivating excessively and retching without throwing up. He also may be restless, depressed, lethargic, and weak with a rapid heart rate. It's important to get your dog to the vet as soon as possible.von Willebrand's Disease (vWD): This is an inherited blood disorder that is caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII antigen (von Willebrand factor). The primary sign is excessive bleeding after an injury or surgery. Other signs, such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or bleeding in the stomach or intestines may also be present. Most dogs with von Willebrand's disease lead normal lives. If you feel this is a concern, your vet can perform tests to determine if your dog has it.Distichiasis: This is a condition in which the dog has an extra row of eyelashes, usually on the lower lid, that cause irritation to the cornea and tearing.Entropion: This defect, which is usually obvious by six months of age, causes the eyelid to roll inward, irritating or injuring the eyeball. One or both eyes can be affected. If your Weimaraner has entropion, you may notice him rubbing at his eyes. The condition can be corrected surgically if necessary.Factor XI Deficiency: This is another bleeding disorder that usually is minor, but may become severe after trauma or surgery.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is caused by a deficiency of thyroid hormone and may produce signs that include infertility, obesity, mental dullness, and lack of energy. The dog's fur may become coarse and brittle and begin to fall out, while the skin becomes tough and dark. Hypothyroidism can be managed very well with a thyroid replacement pill daily. Medication must continue throughout the dog's life.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a degenerative eye disorder that eventually causes blindness from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Fortunately, dogs can use their other senses to compensate for blindness, and a blind dog can live a full and happy life. Just don't make it a habit to move the furniture around. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist and do not breed dogs with this disease.Immune-mediated Disease: A small percentage of Weimaraner puppies react to vaccinations, particularly combination vaccines, with fever, elevated white blood count, and inflamed tissues and joints. Reactions occur most often at 12 to 16 weeks of age. The Weimaraner Club of America recommends that puppies be vaccinated only at 8 and 12 weeks of age with four core vaccines: distemper, adenovirus 2, parainfluenza, and parvovirus. The rabies vaccination can be given at 16 weeks of age.","The first thing to know about the Weimaraner is that he's a housedog. He's not meant for kennel or backyard life, and he's also not suited to apartment living. This highly active dog needs a large, securely fenced yard where he can run, and an active family who can provide him with the exercise and mental stimulation he needs.A sense of humor helps as well, especially when you see how your Weim has relandscaped your yard in his efforts to rid it of mice, moles, and bugs. He'll be proud of himself for his good efforts, so don't forget to praise him as you calculate in your head how much time, money, and effort it will require to put the yard back the way you like it. You might want to supervise him more closely and provide him with additional exercise.Weimaraners need a couple of hours of exercise daily if you want to prevent recreational barking, chewing and digging. Play fetch and other running games, take him jogging or hiking, teach him to run alongside your bicycle, or get him involved in a dog sport such as agility or flyball. And, of course, you can always take him hunting.Be sure your yard is escape-proof. Weims are Houdinis when it comes to confinement, and they're very good at learning how to open doors and gates and jump over or dig under fences. That's another reason why it's best to have them as housedogs.In the house, a mature, well-trained Weimaraner will be your shadow, from bedroom to bathroom to kitchen to den. A Weimaraner puppy is a challenge and requires careful supervision. He can be a destructive chewer and difficult to housetrain. Crate training is a good idea.Weimaraners of any age with separation anxiety, which is not unusual in this breed, can become destructive and may ""dig"" in your carpet or sofa in an attempt to create a secure nest.It's certainly not a behavior problem, but be aware that Weimaraners have loose lips. Nope, they won't sink ships, but they will splash water everywhere when they drink. Keep hand towels handy to wipe their mouths and clean up spills.Weimaraners are highly intelligent, but they're also independent thinkers. That combination can make them a challenge when it comes to training. Be consistent and firm, but gentle. The Weimaraner is sensitive and doesn't respond well to anger, but you must be able to say ""No"" and mean it. Keep training sessions short and interesting, and always end them when he's done something right so you can praise him for a job well done. Last but not least, hold tight to your sense of humor. Your Weimaraner may or may not do as you ask, depending on any number of factors, but he'll always disobey with style.Among the talents your Weimaraner may acquire are getting ice from the dispenser in the door of your refrigerator, turning on faucets, and opening gates and doors — including refrigerator doors. It's a cinch to teach him tricks and you may want to do so, simply to keep him occupied and out of trouble.","Recommended daily amount: 2.5 to 3.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Weimaraner svelte by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test. First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Weim, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Weimaraner's coat is short, smooth, sleek, and solid-colored, ranging from mouse-gray to silver-gray, usually with lighter shades on the head and ears. A distinctly long coat is a disqualification according to the American Kennel Club breed standard — a written description of how a breed looks — but in European countries a longhaired variety is recognized. Longhaired Weimaraners have a silky coat and feathering on their tails and legs, but they are rarely seen in this country.A Weim's nose is dark gray. Inside the flaps of the ears and on the lips, where the coat is thin or nonexistent, the skin is pink, not white or black.A Weimaraner is one of the easiest breeds to groom. Even when he has been running through mud, the dirt just seems to fall off him. Weekly brushing with a bristle brush should keep his coat and skin healthy. Weimaraners shed, but brushing will help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. To make his silvery coat shine, wipe him down with a chamois. Bathe when needed. He takes great pleasure in rolling in anything stinky, so this may be more often than would normally be necessary.All breeds with pendant, or hanging, ears tend to have issues with ear infections. Check your Weimaraner's ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Never stick cotton swabs or anything else into the ear canal or you might damage it. Your Weimaraner may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.Brush your Weimaraner's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Weimaraner enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Weimaraner to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","For an active older child who's familiar with dogs, a Weimaraner can be a great companion. They're far too rambunctious for toddlers, however, and may chase small children who are running.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Weimaraners are not the best choice for families with cats, small dogs, rabbits, hamsters, gerbils, or birds. Weimaraners have a strong prey drive and it's difficult, if not impossible, to redirect that instinct. They will go after and kill, if possible, any small or large furry animals they see.","Weimaraners are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Weimaraners in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed.

Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but you may not notice any signs of discomfort in a dog with hip dysplasia. As the dog ages, arthritis can develop. X-ray screening for hip dysplasia is done by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals or the University of Pennsylvania Hip Improvement Program. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred. If you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.Entropion: This is a condition caused by the lower eyelid folding inward toward the eye, resulting in a chronic irritation of the surface of the eye. It can be corrected through surgery.Epilepsy: This seizure disorder has been noted in some lines of Welsh Springer Spaniels and can be treated with medication. There is no cure.","Welsh Springer Spaniels can be kept outside, with adequate shelter from the heat and cold, but they are such wonderful family companions, why wouldn't you want them in your house, sleeping at your feet in the evening? Welsh Springer Spaniels are fairly active indoors and can live comfortably in city apartments (with proper exercise, of course) or in the country. They do best with at least an average-size yard in which to run. Wherever they live, they are energetic dogs that need a lot of exercise to keep them from becoming fat, bored, and lazy.Keep training sessions short and positive.

Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Welshies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Welshies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Welshies, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Allergies: Allergies are a common ailment in dogs, and the Welsh Terrier is no exception. There are three main types of allergies: food allergies, which are treated by eliminating certain foods from the dog's diet; contact allergies, which are caused by a reaction to a topical substance such as bedding, flea powders, dog shampoos, and other chemicals; and inhalant allergies, which are caused by airborne allergens such as pollen, dust, and mildew. Treatment varies according to the cause and may include dietary restrictions, medications, and environmental changes.Epilepsy: This is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Glaucoma: This is a painful disease in which pressure in the eye is abnormally high due to improper drainage of normal eye fluids. This causes damage to the optic nerve, resulting in vision loss and blindness. Glaucoma may be hereditary, or it may be the result of some other problem in the eye, such as inflammation, a tumor, or injury. The affected eye will be red, teary, squinty, and appear painful; the front of the eye will have a whitish, almost blue cloudiness. Vision loss and eventually blindness will result, sometimes even when treated with surgery or medication.Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma, and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.","Training a Welsh Terrier can be a study in who is more determined, the trainer who's trying to get the Terrier to listen, or the bored Terrier who's ignoring the trainer. The Welshie is known for having a mind of his own and he's not the most obedient of breeds — he's no sunny Golden Retriever — so he will often test limits. Train him with positive reinforcement and consistency. Harsh corrections can shut down any chance at getting through to him.The Welsh Terrier can also become bored easily, so he requires an interesting training routine. Breaking training up with fun games, keeping it free of repetition, and giving him something to work for are excellent ways to get him more interested in training.Socialization is important with a Welsh Terrier. He can be combative with other dogs and animals, but this trait can be corrected with proper training and early and ongoing socialization. In fact, Welsh Terriers generally do well with other dogs once they're socialized.A Welsh Terrier is a high-energy dog. Even with a vigorous exercise routine, you should expect some of that energy to be converted into room-crashing escapades that range throughout the house. He should have a minimum of 30 to 60 minutes of daily exercise, which can be accomplished by playing in a yard or dog park (as long as he isn't too dog-aggressive to go to the dog park), playing in the house, or going on a long walk. Letting him hang in the yard by himself is not going to be enough — and he'll probably jump the fence.The Welsh Terrier is very fond of toys and will burn off ample energy playing by himself with his favorite squeaky toy. He can also make an excellent jogging companion, though his high prey drive means you should keep him leashed on walks.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Welshie doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Welshie accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Welshie in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Welshies are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.Although it's not ideal, the Welsh Terrier can live in an apartment. He will bark, though, and this can become a problem in buildings with noise restrictions. A house with a small, fenced yard is better. Also, he needs to live indoors with the people he loves.","Recommended daily amount: 3/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Welshie in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Welshie, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","Sporting two coats to waterproof himself, the Welsh Terrier has an outer coat that's hard and wiry and an undercoat that's soft and short. He only has one color pattern: tan and black.A non- to light shedder, the Welshie still requires a fair amount of grooming. He should be brushed at least once per week, although it's frankly better to do it every other day. Unless he's clipped, that wiry coat will need to be stripped several times a year to remove any loose or dead hair and to prevent it from matting.Brush your Welshie's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Welshie to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Welsh Terrier is a loving dog who can be patient when he needs to be. Add to that a hardiness that allows him to enjoy a fair amount of roughhousing, and you'll find that he makes a wonderful companion for children.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.He's also basically compatible with other dogs and can do well in homes where he isn't the only canine companion. He is a Terrier though, and he may be dog-aggressive if not properly socialized or trained. He's not recommended for homes with small pets that might be viewed as prey, because all Terriers have a strong prey drive and will give chase.",Welshies are sometimes bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. These dogs may end up in need of adoption or fostering.Welsh Terrier Club of America ,not available

He will dig, bark, and go after vermin. But with proper training, he can be trained to only bark once and to not dig at all, although some dogs are less easily discouraged than others. The vermin chasing, however, is hardwired, and no amount of training will alter it.A Westie does well in multidog homes, unless there is more than one intact male (and he's one of them). He can get used to cats. He cannot adapt to small pets, such as rabbits and birds, because of his strong prey drive.He's generally easy to train if it's done in a positive and consistent way. Bear in mind that a Westie has a strong will and great self-esteem, which can cause some training difficulties if training becomes boring or is too harsh.His coat is easy to groom and only requires regular brushing. If he's not clipped, his coat requires stripping about twice a year.He's a low shedder.Although he doesn't require as much exercise as other breeds, the Westie still needs one or two daily walks or play sessions. He generally has a low energy level inside the house, though individual dogs vary in this regard.A Westie is adaptable and will do well in any type of dwelling, including apartments (although if he isn't trained out of barking, he's likely to cause difficulties with the neighbors).He's a social dog who gets along well with everyone. He likes children of every age, but he's better suited to homes with older children.A Westie can be left for long periods of time when his people are working. Turning on a radio, providing toys and kongs, and crating him are the key strategies to use.If you are a fastidious gardener, the Westie is not your best choice, since he may become fond of digging up plants and be just a tad too enthusiastic about helping you garden.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The West Highland White Terrier is a sturdy little dog with a deep chest and a slightly rectangular shape. Males are about 11 inches tall and typically weigh 15 to 22 pounds; females are roughly 10 inches tall and weigh 13 to 16 pounds. (Unless, of course, you have a soft heart and fall prey to those pleading brown eyes — in which case your Westie, of either sex, could weigh at least twice the norm.)","The West Highland White Terrier is a bold, confident, fun-loving, intelligent dog who can find joy in the simplest pleasures of life, such as squeaky toys, a belly rub, and food. His happy disposition and love of life make him a favorite for many, in spite of his mischievousness. He doesn't lack any self-esteem, but he's not so overbearing in his confidence that his self-assurance becomes a negative trait.He is friendly and gets along with everyone, and he enjoys being part of his family. No docile lapdog, he can be spunky. He rarely starts a fight, but he is after all a terrier, so he won't walk away from one. He's a lively little guy who greets the adventures in life with a sparkle in his eye and a skip in his step — particularly when he's mowing over your feet to get to his food bowl.Same-sex aggression around other dogs is not rare, though females tend to be more alpha than males. The males lean more toward the happy-go-lucky lapdog.","Westies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Westies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Craniomandibular Osteopathy: This condition affects the skull bones while a puppy is growing, causing them to become irregularly enlarged. Symptoms usually appear between four and eight months of age. The cause is unknown but believed to be hereditary. Often the puppy's jaw and glands will become swollen, and he won't be able to open his mouth. He'll drool, have a fluctuating fever that recurs every couple of weeks, and, in some cases, his chewing muscles may atrophy. There is no treatment, but anti-inflammatories and pain relievers help the dog deal with what is a painful condition. Proper nutrition is a must; in severe cases, a feeding tube may be needed. The irregular bone growth slows and typically stops by the time the puppy becomes a year old. The lesions can regress, but a few dogs have permanent jaw problems and therefore have trouble eating. Occasional cases are severe enough to call for jaw surgery.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: If your Westie has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Cataracts: This common eye condition cause sopacity on the lens of the eye, resulting in poor vision. The dog's eye(s) will have a cloudy appearance. Cataracts usually occur in old age and sometimes can be surgically removed to improve vision. West Highland White Terriers are usually afflicted by juvenile cataracts.Pulmonary Fibrosis: Also known as Westie lung disease, this malady scars the supporting tissue in the air sacs and connective tissue of the lungs. This makes the lungs loose their elasticity, which prevents oxygen from passing normally into the blood. Symptoms vary from dog to dog — many dogs show none for years — but they can include loss of stamina, rapid breathing, ""crackling"" in the lungs, a dry cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing. Pulmonary fibrosis can lead to heart failure and other diseases as well. There is no cure and prognosis is always poor, so prevention is critical. Preventing any respiratory infections, limiting exercise, and keeping a healthy weight (or losing weight for overweight dogs) is key. The disease is sometimes treated by keeping the house cool and using bronchial dilators. Treatment has greater success if the disease is diagnosed early, before the scarring gets out of hand.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.","Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Westie doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't.

That double coat protects him from inclement weather and from the teeth and claws of his quarry. The wee white one should, of course, always be white. Any other color is considered a fault in the show ring.His coat is easy to groom and requires regular brushing and trimming. Show dogs generally undergo stripping about twice a year, but most pet owners don't bother. Trimming is usually needed on the feet, and around the ears and eyes. The hair on his head is often plucked to produce that definitive round shape you see on show dogs. His shedding tendencies range from low to nearly zero.The coat stays fairly clean and he should only be bathed when necessary. To keep that coat a nice sparkly white, the Westie requires some tidying and may need to be wiped down — sometimes frequently.Check his ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.","The West Highland White Terrier is a loving dog who is good with older children. But he must have adult supervision around children, particularly younger ones. Some breed books have overemphasized how well the Westie gets along with kids, so breed clubs recommend that all children in a Westie's home be older than seven years of age. This dog can snap if annoyed — but if child and dog are properly supervised, the Westie can do well with children of all ages.A West Highland White Terrier is good with other dogs and is suited for multidog homes. However, an intact male generally dislikes other intact male dogs, Westie or otherwise. He can adjust to cats, but that's easier if he's been raised with them rather than adjusting to a late-life introduction; he has a strong prey drive and will chase cats who decide to run from him. A Westie should not be trusted with small animals because of his prey drive. Bred to go to ground after little varmints, and he can't differentiate between the caged pet mouse in your child's bedroom and a wild mouse that found its way indoors. If you want any small pet, including rabbits or birds, this isn't the breed for you.","Westies are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

Your vet can help you develop a care routine that will keep your dog healthy.Physical and mental stimulation is vital for a Westiepoo's health and happiness. You'll want to aim for at least 45 minutes of outdoor exercise every day. Ideally, you'll have access to an off-leash park or safe fenced-in yard where the breed can dash and dart around. Interactive smart toys are also a must--this is a dog who needs to be challenged and will delight in completing agility and obedience tests.If you can, try and brush your Westiepoo's teeth every day because small dogs can be more prone to dental issues. Also be sure to look at the breed's ears around once a week to check for any signs of possible inflammation or infection. Your Westiepoo's nails should be clipped every month. Speak to your vet if you need guidance in how to carry out the process.","An ideal Westiepoo diet should be formulated for a small breed with high energy.Westiepoos need to stick to a healthy diet, as overeating can cause weight gain and associated health problems, especially if adequate exercise isn't offered.As with all dogs, the Westiepoo's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years.

Whippets have low energy levels indoors, but will become overactive and destructive if their exercise needs are not met.When Whippets are not socialized properly they can become timid and stressed by changes in their environment. A properly socialized Whippet is a polite and undemanding dog who's wonderful with strangers and other dogs alike.Whippets aren't very good watchdogs as they rarely bark and are friendly toward everyone they meet.Whippets need daily exercise and will enjoy romping and running in a fenced yard or on leash.A Whippet should never be allowed to run off leash during walks.Whippets have a strong prey drive and will pursue other animals for several miles.Underground electronic fencing is not recommended for Whippets. They will ignore the shock if they see something to chase. A 5- or 6-foot fence should be enough to confine your Whippet.Whippets don't shed excessively, and weekly brushing will help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture.A Whippet's thin skin is vulnerable to scrapes, tears, and nicks.Without daily exercise, a Whippet can become destructive. When their exercise needs are met, Whippets are generally quiet and calm dogs.Whippets are not outdoor dogs and should live in the house with their people. Whippets can suffer from separation anxiety and can become destructive when they do. It's important to spend time with your Whippet and allow him the freedom to follow you from room to room or just snuggle at your feet, or more likely on the couch with you.Although Whippets do very well in multi-dog households, there have been cases of Whippets attacking and killing cats. There have been some Whippets who live happily with cats and other small furry pets, but these dogs were socialized to the animal at a very young age. If you have any other small pet besides another dog, please be aware that the Whippet might chase the other pet — or worse injure it  — if he's not properly socialized or trained.Whippets are great companions for kids. Nonetheless, it's important to teach your child how to properly interact with dogs and to never leave a young child alone with any breed of dog.Whippets get cold easily. Buy a sweater or coat for your Whippet to wear when it's cold, wet, or snowy outside.To get a healthy pet, never buy a puppy from a backyard breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Find a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs for genetic health conditions and good temperaments.","A male Whippet is 19 to 22 inches tall at the shoulder; females are 18 to 21 inches. Their weight ranges from 18 to 48 pounds, with females being smaller. Males average 34 pounds, females 29 pounds.","Amiable, friendly, quiet, and gentle at home, the Whippet is intense in the chase. He requires a leash or a fenced yard to prevent him from taking off after any moving object, be it a bunny or a radio-controlled car. He doesn't bark much, but he's alert and makes an excellent watchdog. Guard dog? Not so much. He'll happily show the burglar to the silver.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner. Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, Whippets need early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Whippet puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","The Whippet is a generally healthy breed, and buying from a responsible breeder will help ensure that you get the healthiest Whippet possible. A puppy from a reputable Whippet breeder will be vaccinated and dewormed before you take him home. Responsible breeders use only physically sound, mature (at least 2 years or older) dogs, and test their breeding stock for genetic diseases pertinent to the breed.Both parents should have health clearances, documentation that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Whippets, you should expect to see health clearances from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal.Health clearances are not issued to dogs younger than 2 years of age. That's because some health problems don't appear until a dog reaches full maturity. For this reason, it's often recommended that dogs not be bred until they are two or three years old.The following conditions may affect Whippets:Anesthesia Sensitivity: Sighthounds, including Whippets, are sensitive to anesthesia and some other drugs. A normal dose for any other dog of the Greyhound's size can kill a Greyhound, probably because of the breed's low percentage of body fat. Choose a veterinarian who is aware of this sensitivity in sighthounds and will know how to dose your Greyhound. If you cannot find a veterinarian in your town who is knowledgeable about sighthounds, be sure to alert her to this sensitivity to ensure that all anesthetics and drugs are properly administered to your dog.Deafness: Deafness is uncommon in Whippets, but it occurs occasionally. Whippets who are deaf have special training and communication needs, but there are many aids on the market, such as vibrating collars, to make life easier for you and your dog.Eye Diseases: Some Whippets may develop various eye defects. The breeder from whom you purchase your puppy should have eye clearances dated within the past year for both parents certifying that their eyes are normal.von Willebrand's Disease: This is a blood disorder that can be found in humans and dogs. It affects the clotting process due to the reduction of von Willebrand factor in the blood. A dog affected by von Willebrand's disease will have signs such as nose bleeds, bleeding gums, prolonged bleeding from surgery, and prolonged bleeding during heat cycles or after whelping. Occasionally blood is found in the stool. This disorder is usually diagnosed in your dog between the ages of 3 and 5 and cannot be cured. However, it can be managed with treatments that include cauterizing or suturing injuries, transfusions of the von Willebrand factor before surgery, and avoiding certain medications.","Most important to a Whippet's comfort is a nice, soft bed to cushion his body as well as access to your sofa and bed so he can cuddle with you. For cold-weather walks, he'll need a sweater or coat to help him stay warm. He can't tolerate being outdoors in the cold for long periods.A 5- to 6-foot fence will safely contain your Whippet in his yard. An underground electronic fence won't. Your Whippet will readily ignore any shock in favor of giving chase.Give your Whippet a couple of 20- to 30-minute walks on leash daily. As often as possible, he'll love the chance to run off leash in a fenced yard or park, but don't be surprised if his burst of energy lasts only a few minutes.Be careful not to exercise your Whippet puppy too heavily. It's important to avoid any strain on their joints or system. The general rule is five minutes for every month of age; in other words, a 5-month-old puppy should receive no more than 25 minutes of exercise per day.Whippets are easily housetrained, and using a crate will help. A crate is your Whippet's safe place, and he won't want to soil it. Putting him in it when you can't watch him will ensure that he doesn't have an accident in the house or chew up something he shouldn't. A crate keeps him safe and both of you happy.Train your Whippet with praise, patience, and positive reinforcement. Whippets are smart and willing, but they also have a mind of their own. Reward them with food or praise when they do what you like, and never be harsh with them. They're sensitive and will stop working for you if you yell at them, try to force them to do something, or hurt their feelings.With patience and consistency, you will find yourself the owner of a well-trained Whippet. After basic obedience you may want to pursue training in dog sports such as flyball, agility, and lure coursing.","Recommended daily amount: 1 to 1.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into 2 feedings.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.For more on feeding your Whippet, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Whippet's short, smooth coat lies close to the body. It can be any color or color combination. You'll see him in black, white, red, fawn, blue, cream, brindle, and various combinations of those colors with a wide variety of spots, blazes, and patches.Keep your Whippet's coat shiny with weekly brushing, using a rubber curry brush or hound glove. This will help to remove what little hair the breed sheds. You shouldn't need to bathe your Whippet frequently unless he rolls in something stinky.Because of his thin coat, a Whippet's skin is not as protected as that of other breeds. It's common for Whippets to have nicks, scrapes, and tears that occasionally require stitches. Check him frequently for such injuries and to ensure that there are no infections in any of the nicks and scrapes.Otherwise, the only grooming he needs is dental hygiene and nail care. Brush your Whippet's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Short, neatly trimmed nails keep the feet in good condition and prevent your legs from getting scratched when your Whippet enthusiastically jumps up to greet you.Begin accustoming your Whippet to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth and ears. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Whippets enjoy playing with kids. They're not so large that they knock them over easily, and they're not so small or delicate that they're easily injured by them. That said, a few ground rules will keep everyone safe.Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Whippets like the company of other dogs, and the presence of another dog or two can help keep them from being lonely if you're gone during the day. They have a high prey drive, however, and aren't really suited to living in homes with cats. It's their nature to chase small furry creatures, after all. Some Whippets can learn to live peacefully with cats, especially if they're brought up with them from puppyhood, but you should always supervise them when they're together and separate them when you're not home.","Whippets are often bought without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering.National Whippet Club of CanadaNorthern California Whippet Fanciers AssociationWhippet Rescue and Placement",not available

But train your Whoodle with kindness and encouragement and you'll have a loyal friend for life.","Whoodles are generally considered to be healthy dogs, although they can suffer from some common health issues. As with any dog, it's important to maintain good care and schedule regular veterinary checkups.Some of the more common health problems Whoodles suffer from include:Eye infections and diseasesKidney issuesAddison's diseaseRetinal atrophy","As with all dogs, it's important to keep up your Whoodle's regular veterinary checkups to detect any health concerns early.

Try to aim for at least one mile of walking every day--and more if you can fit it in. Whoodles are naturally playful and energetic dogs, so you need to keep them active.The Whoodles' parent breeds, the Poodle and the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier, are pretty high maintenance dogs, and just like them your Whoodle will require regular grooming. The dog's silky coat should be brushed daily. It's also advisable to consider regular coat trimming sessions every two or three months.Whoodles require regular nail trimming, so either invest in appropriate tools yourself or find a trusted groomer to carry out the process. Consult with your vet if you have any concerns about how best to care for your Whoodle's grooming needs.","An ideal Whoodle diet should be formulated for a medium-sized breed with medium energy.As with all dogs, the Whoodle's dietary needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood and will continue to change into their senior years. You should ask your veterinarian for recommendations about your Whoodle's diet, as there is far too much variation among individual dogs--including weight, energy, and health--to make a specific recommendation.","Whoodle coats are often described as being silky to the touch. The dog's fur usually comes in a range of colors including black, brown, red, silver grey, and cream. The coat might also be spotted.Whoodles have medium length coats. Due to the luxurious nature of the dog's coat, daily brushing is recommended.

They require daily exercise, preferably a minimum of 20 minutes off-leash per day.They can adjust to city living, although they're not recommended for apartments. Griffons do best in the country where they have room to run. They also do better if they reside inside the home with their families, rather than living in the yard or a kennel.Wirehaired Pointing Griffons thrive when they're with their owners; they can suffer from separation anxiety if they're left alone for long periods at a time.Although they're a nonshedding breed, Griffons still require some care. Expect to brush about once a week and to strip the coat several times per year.Wirehaired Pointing Griffons generally do well with other dogs and pets.Griffons enjoy being a companion breed. They have a loving and gentle temperament, making them good with children. They're usually accepting of everyone, although some can be high-strung and nervous when introduced to new people, dogs, and situations. Early socialization is important with all breeds, and the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is no exception.Although they don't have the suspicious nature of guarding breeds, Wirehaired Pointing Griffons do make excellent watchdogs since they will alert bark if someone comes to the house. Don't expect them to carry it further and defend the house, though, since they tend to be easygoing with everyone.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon should be a medium-sized dog, males averaging 22 to 24 inches in height and females ranging from 20 to 22 inches. The average weight is 50 to 60 pounds.","The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is often described as the ""supreme gundog,"" and her energetic and intelligent nature leaves little doubt as to why. She's a versatile hunting dog who will both point and retrieve.She also makes a devoted and loyal family companion. She's likely to have a sense of humor that will amuse everyone, and she won't lose this trait with age. She's likely to be loving and accepting of just about everyone, although some Griffons have been known to be nervous around strangers.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Griffon needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Griffon puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Griffons are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Griffons will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Griffons, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): This is a family of eye diseases that involves the gradual deterioration of the retina. Early in the disease, affected dogs become night-blind; they lose sight during the day as the disease progresses. Many affected dogs adapt well to their limited or lost vision, as long as their surroundings remain the same.Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition in which the thighbone doesn't fit snugly into the hip joint. Some dogs show pain and lameness on one or both rear legs, but others don't display outward signs of discomfort. (X-ray screening is the most certain way to diagnose the problem.) Either way, arthritis can develop as the dog ages. Dogs with hip dysplasia should not be bred, so if you're buying a puppy, ask the breeder for proof that the parents have been tested for hip dysplasia and are free of problems.","The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is an intelligent breed, a quick learner who's eager to please. It's important to start training early, especially if you want to train her as a gundog. Socialization should also start as soon as vaccinations are complete, since Griffons — though not generally aggressive — can sometimes be high-strung or nervous around new people, dogs, and situations.Although Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are hardy enough to live in kennels, they do much better living indoors with their families. They thrive when they're working closely with people. They also do better in the country where there's room to run, but they can adapt to city living if they have a fenced yard. They're not recommended for apartments.The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon needs regular exercise, a minimum of 20 minutes of free play every day. She does better when she's exercised off-lead in a yard; if you walk her on a leash, then you'll need to spend more time, since she can't receive the same workout as when she's running loose. Like many sporting breeds, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon has a lot of energy but can be fairly calm when inside the house.","Recommended daily amount: 2 to 2.5 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on her size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

If you're unsure whether she's overweight, give her the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at her. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on her back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see her ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, she needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Griffon, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon has a dense double coat. The undercoat is a thick, weather-resistant down. The topcoat is harsh in texture and consists of straight, wiry hair. It is medium in length and should never be curly. The Griffon should have eyebrows and a moustache, both of which are extensions of the undercoat.The preferred coat is a steel gray color with chestnut brown or roan markings. Colors that are less desired in the show ring are a uniform white or brown, or white and orange.The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is considered to be a nonshedder; any hair loss is light. The coat should be combed through about once a week and stripped of dead or loose hair. The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon should only be bathed when necessary, since bathing can soften the natural harshness of its coat.The ears need special attention and must be kept clean and dry, especially after swimming. Otherwise they can trap water, dirt, and debris, leading to ear infections. Check them weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Brush your Griffon's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time she sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.Begin accustoming your Griffon to being brushed and examined when she's a puppy. Handle her paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside her mouth.

Their weight ranges from 10 to 50 pounds.","The adult Xolo is a calm dog who is aloof toward strangers but attentive toward their family. They usually choose one person as their favorite but don't stint on affection toward other family members. A daily walk or an energetic playtime in a fenced yard satisfies their exercise needs. The rest of the time, they'll enjoy lying in the sun or snuggling with you in an effort to stay warm. Take them with you whenever you can; they're not fond of being left home alone.Xolos are excellent watchdogs and will alert you to anything that seems of concern. They are not nuisance barkers, however, so if they sound off, it's a good idea to see what has disturbed them. Xolos are wary of strangers and are not the type of dog to make friends easily with people outside their family. They are also territorial toward other animals that come onto their property. Xolos that have not been well socialized may be aggressive toward people or dogs they don't know.Bring up a Xolo with consistency and structure. Train using gentle positive reinforcement techniques, and this smart and sensitive dog will quickly learn what you like and don’t like. Once they knows that, a stern glance is generally all that's needed to correct any misbehavior. An inexperienced dog owner can be easily manipulated by this breed, however, so a Xolo may not be the best choice for a first-timer.The Xolo is also highly athletic. Scaling a six-foot fence is nothing to an adult Xolo, and even puppies can scramble over three-foot fences. Be sure that your yard is escape-proof.Puppies are highly active and can be destructive if they aren’t kept busy with play and training. As they mature, they start to become the mellow dogs that typify the breed.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them.Like every dog, Xoloitzcuintli need early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Xoloitzcuintli puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Enrolling them in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking them to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help them polish their social skills.","The Xoloitzcuintli appears to be a healthy breed, though as with all dogs, you should make sure they're vaccinated and dewormed before you take them home.Although the Xolo is not known to be prone to any serious genetic diseases, they have some traits that can affect their appearance and how you care for him. The first, of course, is hairlessness. A Xolo needs protection from the sun and from extremely cold weather. Apply sunscreen formulated for dogs all over their body, especially if they're light-colored, and don’t leave them outdoors for long periods unless they have a shady place where they can retreat from the sun's rays. In snowy or bitter cold weather, they'll appreciate a sweater or coat to keep them warm. Indoors, let the Xolo go naked so they don't overheat or develop skin problems from having their pores covered up. The good news is that their tough skin heals quickly if they get a cut or abrasion.Another interesting facet to the Xolo is that hairlessness and dentition are genetically linked. Many adult hairless Xolos are missing their premolars, the bicuspids located between the canines and the molars. This does not affect their ability to eat and is not faulted in the show ring. Coated Xolos have full dentition.","Trim the Xolo's fast-growing nails weekly. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. The earlier you introduce your Xoloitzcuintli to nail trimming the less stressful the experience is for both of you.Brush the teeth at least two or three times a week--daily is better--to remove tartar and bacteria. Start when your puppy is young so they'll be used to it.Keep up with yearly vet visits for checkups to maintain good health.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the ears, nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Ears should smell good, without too much wax or gunk inside, and eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Recommended daily amount: Depending on a Xolo's size, they should eat 5/8 to 1.75 cups of a high-quality dog food daily, divided into two meals.How much your adult dog eats depends on their size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference--the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.It's easy to overfeed a Xoloitzcuintli, but obesity can stress their joints, so they shouldn't be allowed to grow overweight. Keep your adult Xoloitzcuintli in good shape by measuring their food and feeding them twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether they're overweight, give them the hands-on test. Place your hands on their back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see their ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, they need less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Xoloitzcuintli, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The hairless Xolo has smooth but tough skin that fits closely to their body. What little hair they have adorns the top of the head, the feet and the last third of the tail, up to the tip. A coated Xolo is completely covered with short, smooth, close-fitting hair. In both varieties, the hair may be any color. Typically, it is black, gray-black, slate, red, liver or bronze. Some Xolos have white spots and markings.You might think that a hairless dog needs little to no grooming, but think again. It's true that Xolos often clean themselves like cats and are unlikely to get fleas, but because they sweat through their skin and paw pads, it's important to keep those areas clean. Wash the feet weekly to make sure the sebaceous glands remain unclogged.Bathe the dog every couple of weeks with a gentle dog shampoo. It is usually not necessary to apply oils or lotions to the skin. Wipe off any sunscreen after the dog has been outside.","The family-oriented Xolo can be good with children, especially if they're brought up with them. They're not a big fan of having their ears or tail pulled, however, so supervise any interactions with very young children. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be left unsupervised with a child.Xoloitzcuintli can get along well with other dogs and cats if they grow up with them, too. They may be less sociable toward stranger dogs, however, and their high prey drive inclines them to chase cats and other furry animals they see outdoors.","Xoloitzcuintlis are sometimes purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one, and these dogs often end up in the care of rescue groups, in need of adoption or fostering. Other Xoloitzcuintlis end up in rescue because their owners have divorced or died. Adopting an adult Xoloitzcuintli has many benefits. Adult dogs are often already housetrained and have some obedience training, and they've already gone through the destructive puppy stage.Xoloitzcuintli Primitive Breed Rescue",not available

There's been an increase in multigenerational breeding (Yorkipoo to Yorkipoo), and also in Yorkipoo to Poodle or Yorkipoo to Yorkshire Terrier breeding; but many litters are first generation, the result of breeding two purebred parents.A Yorkipoo is active and energetic, as are both Poodles and Yorkies. He requires daily exercise and does well with a good walk or romp in the yard.Barking is a favorite pastime. Occasionally a Yorkipoo can be trained to bark less, but expect to hear the noise whenever someone comes to the door. He has no clue that his bark doesn't terrify anyone.He is a non- to low-shedder and can make an excellent companion for people with allergies.Daily brushing is needed to keep his fine, silky coat free of tangles and mats.Loving and gentle, the Yorkipoo can make an excellent companion to older, more considerate children.

He's got a stubborn streak, though, so expect some occasional resistance.The Yorkipoo can live very happily in an apartment.He generally does well with other dogs and pets.A companion dog, he may suffer from separation anxiety when left alone for long periods at a time.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","The Yorkipoo ranges from 7 to 15 inches in height and 3 to 14 pounds in weight. Size can differ between individuals, and the mature adult size is usually a reflection of the size of Poodle who was used for the crossbreeding.","The Yorkipoo is an active, affectionate, fun-loving dog who relishes the company of people. He is loving and loyal, a true companion dog who enjoys participating in family activities. He's confident, thanks to his terrier heritage, but usually he's also easygoing and less demanding than many other small breeds.He's intelligent enough that, given consistent and positive training, he can be a perfect companion. He tends to be watchful and is happy looking at the world from the warmth of his owner's lap, but he also enjoys exploring new things on his own.Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.Like every dog, the Yorkipoo needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Yorkipoo puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.","Yorkipoos are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Yorkipoos will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition.In Yorkipoos, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Epilepsy: Epilepsy is a neurological condition that's often, but not always, inherited. It can cause mild or severe seizures that may show themselves as unusual behavior (such as running frantically as if being chased, staggering, or hiding) or even by falling down, limbs rigid, and losing consciousness. Seizures are frightening to watch, but the long-term prognosis for dogs with idiopathic epilepsy is generally very good. It's important to take your dog to the vet for proper diagnosis (especially since seizures can have other causes) and treatment.Patellar Luxation: Also known as slipped stifles, this is a common problem in small dogs. The patella is the kneecap. Luxation means dislocation of an anatomical part (as a bone at a joint). Patellar luxation is when the knee joint (often of a hind leg) slides in and out of place, causing pain. This can be crippling, although many dogs lead relatively normal lives with this condition.Portosystemic Shunt (PSS): This is an abnormal flow of blood between the liver and the body. That's a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet.Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease: This is a condition involving the hip joint. If your Yorkipoo has Legg-Perthes, the blood supply to the head of the femur (the large rear leg bone) is decreased, and the head of the femur that connects to the pelvis begins to disintegrate. The first symptoms, limping and atrophy of the leg muscle, usually occur when puppies are four to six months old. Surgery can correct the condition, usually resulting in a pain-free puppy.Hypothyroidism: This is a disorder of the thyroid gland. It's thought to be responsible for conditions such as epilepsy, alopecia (hair loss), obesity, lethargy, hyperpigmentation, pyoderma ,and other skin conditions. It is treated with medication and diet.Hyperadrenocorticism: Also known as Addison's disease, this is an extremely serious condition. It's caused by an insufficient production of adrenal hormones by the adrenal gland. Most dogs with Addison's disease vomit, have a poor appetite, and have little energy. Because these signs are vague and can be mistaken for other conditions, it's easy to misdiagnose this disease until it reaches more advanced stages. More severe signs occur when a dog is stressed or when potassium levels become high enough to interfere with heart function, causing severe shock and death. If your vet suspects Addison's, a series of tests can confirm the diagnosis.Atopic Dermatitis: This is an inherited skin disease that manifests itself as a predisposition to develop allergic symptoms following repeated exposure to some otherwise harmless substance, typically an allergen such as dust mites or pollen. It usually shows up by the time the dog is about three years old. An atopic animal usually rubs, licks, chews, bites, or scratches at his feet, muzzle, ears, armpits, or groin. This irritation causes hair loss and redness and thickening of the skin. Treatment involves removing the allergen as much as possible, and administering antihistamines and steroids. Use hypoallergenic shampoos on affected dogs.","The Yorkipoo is equally at home in a house or an apartment. He's far too small to live outside; he must live indoors for both his physical and emotional well-being. He requires daily exercise, since he has a surprising amount of energy (read between those lines). A daily walk or romp in the yard will provide enough exercise to keep him healthy and happy. The Yorkipoo can also burn off steam by playing a game of fetch down a hallway.Crate training benefits every dog and is a kind way to ensure that your Yorkipoo doesn't have accidents in the house or get into things he shouldn't. A crate is also a place where he can retreat for a nap. Crate training at a young age will help your Yorkipoo accept confinement if he ever needs to be boarded or hospitalized.Never stick your Yorkipoo in a crate all day long, however. It's not a jail, and he shouldn't spend more than a few hours at a time in it except when he's sleeping at night. Yorkipoos are people dogs, and they aren't meant to spend their lives locked up in a crate or kennel.","Recommended daily amount: 1/4 to 1 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.Keep your Yorkipoo in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.For more on feeding your Yorkipoo, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.","The coat of the Yorkipoo can range from straight to curly, and it should be luxuriously soft and silky in texture — running your fingers through it is heavenly.Although it's different for every Yorkipoo, a puppy resulting from a multigenerational breeding (a Yorkipoo crossed with another Yorkipoo) is supposed to be odorless and nonshedding — although ""nonshedding"" is a fantasy, since every dog on the planet sheds at least a tiny bit. The Yorkipoo produces little dander, which is actually the trait that appeals to the allergic owner.The Yorkipoo is seen in a wide variety of colors, including cream, black, white, red, sable, apricot, tan, chocolate, gray, and silver. This versatile boy can sport multiple colors and a wide variety of markings, including black with tan points.Although he's considered to be a non- to low-shedder, the Yorkipoo requires care in keeping that fine coat silky and healthy. Brushing him daily wards off tangles. Brush the hair away from the eyes to prevent it from becoming an irritant, which it will certainly be if this task is neglected. You can also protect his eyes by trimming the hair with a pair of scissors.His coat should be trimmed regularly to whatever length you prefer; that's the beauty of a designer breed. No one is going to say you've clipped him incorrectly, because there is no ""correct"" cut. Bathing keeps his coat silky to the touch, but he only needs to be bathed when it's necessary, not on a schedule.Brush your Yorkipoo's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Toy breeds are notorious for dental problems, as it's tough to get all those teeth into such a tiny mouth. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.Trim nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.Begin accustoming your Yorkipoo to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","The Yorkipoo is a gentle and loving dog who can do well with children. He's not recommended for homes with very young children, since he can be easily injured when improperly handled. A Yorkipoo can make an excellent companion for an older, more considerate child.As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.In general, he does well with other dogs and pets (not that there are a lot of pets much smaller than he is, but he doesn't grasp that). He may display prey drive due to his Yorkie parent, however. That may lead him to chase smaller pets and cats, but usually it's in good fun.","Yorkipoos are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one. There are many Yorkipoos in need of adoption and or fostering. There are a number of rescues that we have not listed. If you don't see a rescue listed for your area, contact the national breed club or a local breed club and they can point you toward a Yorkipoo rescue.Poo-Mix Rescue",not available

Crate-training is recommended.Yorkshire Terriers don't like the cold and are prone to chills, especially if they're damp or in damp areas.Because of their small size, delicate structure, and terrier personality, Yorkshire Terrier generally aren't recommended for households with toddlers or small children.Some Yorkshire Terriers can be ""yappy,"" barking at every sound they hear. Early and consistent training can help. If you don't feel qualified to provide this training, consult a professional dog trainer.Yorkshire Terriers can have delicate digestive systems and may be picky eaters. Eating problems can occur if your Yorkie has teeth or gum problems as well. If your Yorkie is showing discomfort when eating or after eating, take him to the vet for a checkup.Yorkshire Terriers think they are big dogs and will try to pick a fight with a big dog if allowed. Be sure to keep your Yorkie under control. Even better, try to socialize your Yorkie at an early age by taking him to obedience classes.Yorkies tend to retain their puppy teeth, especially the canines. When your puppy is around five months old, check his teeth often. If you notice that an adult tooth is trying to come in but the baby tooth is still there, take him to your vet. Retained baby teeth can cause the adult teeth to come in unevenly, which may contribute to tooth decay in later years.To get a healthy dog, never buy a puppy from an irresponsible breeder, puppy mill, or pet store. Look for a reputable breeder who tests her breeding dogs to make sure they're free of genetic diseases that they might pass onto the puppies, and that they have sound temperaments.","Yorkshire Terriers should be 8 to 9 inches at the shoulder and weigh no more than seven pounds, with four to six pounds being preferred.Yorkies are inconsistent in size. It's not unusual for a single litter to contain one Yorkie weighing less than four pounds, one who weighs five or six pounds, and one who grows to be 12 to 15 pounds.Beware of breeders who offer ""tea cup"" Yorkshire Terriers. Dogs who are smaller than the standard are prone to genetic disorders and are at a higher health risk in general.","Smart and self-assured, the Yorkshire Terrier is a combination of endearingly small size and adventurous terrier spirit. The breed displays a range of personalities. Some are cuddly and perky, wanting nothing more than to follow in their people's footsteps throughout the day. Others are mischievous, outgoing, and into everything.Set limits, and your Yorkie will be a wonderful companion, but if you spoil him, watch out! Start training when they're puppies, and you'll have much better luck than if you let them have their way and then try to correct bad habits.Like all dogs, Yorkies needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Yorkie will be a friendly, well-rounded dog.","Yorkies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions.If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents.

You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).Patellar Luxation: Also known as ""slipped stifles,"" this is a common problem in small dogs. It is caused when the patella, which has three parts — the femur (thigh bone), patella (knee cap), and tibia (calf) — is not properly lined up. This causes a lameness in the leg or an abnormal gait in the dog. It is a disease that is present at birth although the actual misalignment or luxation does not always occur until much later. The rubbing caused by patellar luxation can lead to arthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. There are four grades of Patellar Luxation ranging from grade I, which is an occasional luxation causing temporary lameness in the joint, to grade IV, in which the turning of the tibia is severe and the patella cannot be realigned manually. This gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Severe grades of patellar luxation may require surgical repair.Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA): A degenerative eye disorder. Blindness caused by PRA is a slow process resulting from the loss of photoreceptors at the back of the eye. PRA is detectable years before the dog shows any signs of blindness. Reputable breeders have their dogs' eyes certified annually by a veterinary ophthalmologist.Portosystemic Shunt: Portosystemic shunt (PSS) is an abnormal flow of blood between the liver and the body. That's a problem, because the liver is responsible for detoxifying the body, metabolizing nutrients, and eliminating drugs. Signs can include but are not limited to neurobehavioral abnormalities, lack of appetite, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), intermittent gastrointestinal issues, urinary tract problems, drug intolerance, and stunted growth. Signs usually appear before two years of age. Corrective surgery can be helpful in long-term management, as can a special diet.Hypoglycemia: Like many toy and small breed dogs, Yorkies can suffer from hypoglycemia when stressed, especially when they are puppies. Hypoglycemia is caused by low blood sugar. Some of the signs may include weakness, confusion, a wobbly gait, and seizure-like episodes. If your dog is susceptible to this, talk to your vet about prevention and treatment options.Collapsed trachea: The trachea, which carries air to the lungs, tends to collapse easily. The most common sign of a collapsed trachea is a chronic, dry, harsh cough that many describe as being similar to a ""goose honk."" Collapsed trachea can be treated medically or surgically.Reverse sneezing: This condition is sometimes confused with a collapsed trachea. This is a far less serious condition and lasts only a few minutes. Reverse sneezing primarily occurs when your dog is excited or tries to eat or drink too fast. It also can occur when there are pollens or other irritants in the air. Secretions from the dog's nose drop onto their soft palate, causing it to close over the windpipe in an automatic reaction. This can be very frightening to your Yorkie, but as soon as he calms down, the reverse sneezing stops. Gently stroke his throat to help him relax.Eye infections, teeth, and gum problems also can occur.","Yorkshire Terriers enjoy taking a walk with you or playing outside, but since they're very active while indoors, it doesn't take a lot of effort to keep them well exercised.In general, Yorkies are receptive to training, especially if it brings them attention for performing cute tricks or performing in agility or obedience trials. They can be difficult to housetrain, however, because their ""accidents"" are so small and easy to clean up that people let it slide. That's a mistake. It's better to show them where to go from the beginning and reward them for doing their business in the right place. When you make the effort, you can end up with a very well trained Yorkie indeed.They definitely are housedogs and don't tolerate extreme heat or cold well. Many people paper train their Yorkshire Terriers so they don't have to take them outdoors when the weather is too hot or cold.Yorkies love squeaky toys, but it's important to check the toy every few days to make sure they haven't chewed them open and pulled out the squeaker. They especially enjoy fetching toys that you throw for them. If you're crafty, consider crocheting a ball for your Yorkie — larger than a golf ball but smaller than a tennis ball — and stuffing it with used panty hose. He'll love it!","Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 3/4 cup of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.Note: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level.

Show dogs have hair that reaches the floor. They have a single coat and shed very little.Puppies are born black, with the blue and tan coat developing gradually, usually after they're a year old. Puppies that start to lighten before they're a year old often turn gray rather than blue.From the back of the head to the tip of the tail, the hair is a dark steel-blue — sometimes described as the blue of a rifle barrel — with a bluish sheen when seen in the sunlight. The head is bright gold, not reddish, with tan hairs that are darker at the roots than at the ends. The headfall (the hair that falls over the face) is long with the same golden hue as the face.The hair is slightly darker at the base of the ears and on the muzzle. The tan on the head doesn't extend past the ears, and no black hairs are mixed in with the tan. Yorkshire Terriers have tan legs as well, but the tan color doesn't extend above the elbow.An interesting fact is that Yorkies tend to become lighter with age. Hormonal changes can also affect color. Females in heat go lighter, and then darken again after their season is over.Grooming a long-haired Yorkshire Terrier is not for the faint of heart, especially if he has a ""soft"" coat that tangles easily instead of a silky one! Even if you keep his coat trimmed short, gently brush your Yorkie's coat every day to help prevent mats and keep him clean.Small breeds are prone to dental problems, and Yorkies are no exception. Yorkshire Terriers tend to form a lot of tartar on their teeth and can lose their teeth at a young age, so brush their teeth regularly and schedule a professional cleaning by your vet at least once a year.As part of the grooming process, check your Yorkie's ears regularly. Look inside them and give them a good sniff. If they appear to be infected (have an offensive odor, redness, or a brown discharge), ask your vet to check them. If there's hair in the ear canal, pluck it out with your fingers or ask your vet or groomer to do it for you.Bathe your Yorkie weekly to keep his coat beautiful and shiny. There's no need to rub the coat to wash it. After wetting the coat and applying the shampoo, all you need to do is run your fingers through it to lift the dirt out. Apply conditioner, then rinse thoroughly.When you're drying your Yorkie, spray the coat with a light conditioner. Give the coat a spritz with a light conditioner when you're brushing him as well. Never brush a dry or dirty coat or you'll break the hair.Trim your Yorkie's nails after each bath to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.When you're grooming your Yorkie, be sure to check the anal area and trim around it with scissors if the hair's getting too long. Usually trimming about a half inch of hair around it is enough.After you've brushed your Yorkie and he's dry, collect the hair on the top of his head, starting at the outer corner of the eye, going back at an angle toward the center of head, then back down to the outer corner of the other eye. Brush this hair up and fasten it with a latex band, and then add your favorite bow.Begin accustoming your Yorkie to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.","Because of their small size, Yorkies aren't suited to families with young children. Most breeders won't sell puppies to people whose children are younger than 5 or 6 years old. It's just too easy for children to drop them, step on them, or hold them too tightly.Yorkies can get along well with other pets, including cats, if socialized to them at an early age. They're bold in going after strange dogs, however, even those that outweigh them by a factor of ten, and protecting them from themselves becomes second nature to people with Yorkies.","Yorkshire Terriers are often purchased without any clear understanding of what goes into owning one.

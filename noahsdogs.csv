Affenpinscher,Small: Weight Male 6.5 – 9 lb (3 – 4 kg) Female 6.5 – 9 lb (3 – 4 kg Height Male 9.5 – 11” (24 – 28 cm) Female 9.5 – 11” (24 – 28 cm,"The origin of the Affenpinscher is not well known or documented, however it is widely agreed that the breed originated in Germany. The Affenpinscher was originally bred to be a working dog on farms, where it tracked game and wildlife in the German countryside and kept the barns and outbuildings free from vermin such as rats and mice. The name Affenpinscher can be loosely translated as Monkey Terrier, which is a nickname for the breed. However, strictly speaking Affen means to mock and pinscher means terrier, so Mocking Terrier is a closer translation. Over time, the Affenpinscher was bred to be smaller. Their smaller, toy size soon found them popularity as a companion dog and family pet more than a working dog. However, Affenpinschers were still used as rat hunters. The original, larger breed of Affenpinscher is now extinct. The Affenpinscher is an old breed. There is evidence of Affenpinschers dating back to the 1600s, and similar looking dogs can be seen in paintings that go back as far as the 1400s. They are considered to be one of the oldest breeds of toy dog. Affenpinschers went on to contribute to a variety of more modern breeds, including the Miniature Schnauzer, the Griffon Bruxellosis and the Brussels Griffon.","Your Affenpinscher is alert, spirited and confident. He is wonderfully self-assured yet non argumentative and real people pleaser. Affenpinschers like nothing better than to be close to their families and, although they are not overly clingy, they should be involved with all aspects of family life both inside and outside the home. They’ll appreciate being taken out on family outings and trips, whenever possible. Your Affenpinscher has a curious and inquisitive nature which means he can be a bit mischievous if there’s somewhere he wants to be or something he wants to do. Affenpinschers are not only curious, but they are keen problem solvers and prone to independence, so it’s important to stay one step ahead of them or they may end up running rings around you! Your Affenpinscher will happily get along with other dogs and animals, making him a great dog for households which already have pets.","While your Affenpinscher may be small, he has no concept of his diminutive stature and isn’t afraid to square up to much larger dogs. Affenpinschers can be territorial and show guarding behaviour of their food and toys, which means they are not well suited to families with young children as the breed cannot show the patience needed around them. However, older children who can be taught how to respect the dog’s boundaries will find that Affenpinschers make very good companions. The Affenpinscher is a very affectionate and loving dog, who is highly protective of his family. Though they are most often quiet, the Affenpinscher will bark and become over excited when threatened and is fearless in the face of aggressors. In order to make sure that your Affenpinscher is well mannered and polite, socialise him from an early age with other dogs, animals and people.","The Affenpinscher has a small and compact frame with a lively gait. The head should be small in proportion to the body, with a rounded forehead and broad brow. The jaw is a little undershot and no teeth should show through.  The Affenpinscher has small, round and black eyes and small, erect ears which are set high. The forelegs should be straight and the feet are small and round. The tail is highly set with a gentle curve over the back while moving. The Affenpinscher coat is rough and coarse, with short dense hair on some parts of the body and longer, shaggier hair on the shoulders, neck and head. The face should show bushy eyebrows and a monkey-like look.","The Affenpinscher’s coat usually comes in black with a small amount of grey shading around the face or chest. Silver, tan and red marking have been found, though rarely.","It’s important to start training your Affenpinscher from a very early age, as they are highly intelligent but can become stubborn as they get older, making them more difficult to obedience train. Your Affenpinscher enjoys a mental challenge, but can become bored if training isn’t fun or interesting enough for him. Therefore, it is best to keep your training session together short, varied and intense. Their intelligence allows them to learn new behaviours quickly, but this also includes incorrect behaviour so consistent and careful training is vital. Your Affenpinscher will respond well to positive, reward based training and clear, confident commands.","The Affenpinscher needs regular brushing, every two to three days, in order to keep his coarse coat healthy and knot free. As the breed is sensitive to extreme temperatures, keep an eye on your Affenpinscher during hot or cold weather and keep him as an indoors dog – they are not well suited to life as a kennel dog. Clean their ears, teeth and trim the nails every week.","The average Affenpinscher lifespan is 14 to 15 years. The breed is generally fairly hardy, though there are few known genetic health concerns. They are susceptible to Patent Ductus Arteriosis or PDA which is a rare heart condition, as well as an open fontanel, which is when the bones of the skull do not form together correctly. Slipped kneecaps, or Patella Luxation is also known to be an issue for the Affenpinscher, like many small breeds, but this can be treated. Due to their fine bones, Affenpinschers can be prone to bone fractures and breaks, so they must not be allowed to jump off furniture.","('Toy',)",Single people Couples Families with older children People who enjoy long walks People who live in the city,Independent Affectionate and loving Curious and inquisitive Playful Courageous
Afghan Hound,Large: Weight Male 55 – 62 lb (25 – 28 kg) Female 51 – 55 lb (23 – 25 kg) Height Male 27 – 29” (68 – 74 cm) Female 25 – 27” (63 – 69 cm),"The Afghan Hound is very old breed of dog, dating back thousands of years. The Afghan’s origins are pre-Christian, though it is not known from exactly which era the breed originates from. It has been suggested that today’s Afghan Hound comes from an ancient Persian breed which was brought into and traded with in Afghanistan and India. While the Afghan Hound has an elegant and sleek look, it is thought that it was originally bred to be a hunting dog and would be used to track and catch deer, gazelles, wolves and foxes. There has also been speculation that the dogs were used in Africa to hunt big cats like leopards and panthers, showing the brave determination of the breed. The thick coat of the breed was most likely bred in early on, when dogs with the thickest and most luxuriant coats were chosen for breeding purposes. The Afghan Hound was prohibited from being exported until the late 1800s when it was finally brought into the UK. A man called Captain Banff brought his dog, Zardin, into England and subsequently showed him at the Crystal Palace Kennel Club show in 1907. This highlighted the breed, which gained a great deal of attention following the show.","Your Afghan Hound is intelligent, dignified and reserved. Though generally a well-mannered dog, Afghans can be highly strung and need a confident and firm yet fair owner to ensure that they do not become irritable, neurotic or shy. They are head strong and can be stubborn and wilful, so patience and consistency is also a prerequisite of anyone considering adding an Afghan Hound to their family. Afghans are best suited to experienced dog trainers as they can be difficult to housetrain and teach basic obedience to as puppies. They must be well socialised with other pets and people from a very early age or they may become shy with strangers or even scared of meeting new people. Your Afghan loves galloping across open land and going on long runs, but he will also thoroughly enjoy relaxing at home with his family. Nicknamed ‘The Aristocrat’ of the dog world, Afghans are elegant and charming, though they can come across as snobbish on occasion.","Your Afghan Hound has a very special relationship with you. They are generally quite aloof with people, but with their owner and family they show a different side to their personality. They can be clownish and humorous and love to play. Your Afghan loves to stay close to you and wants to be involved in all aspects of family life from doing chores or gardening to going out to the park on a sunny afternoon. When properly socialised as puppies, Afghans make wonderful companions for children and show patience and restraint around them during playtime. Their tendency to shyness means that socialisation must take place at every opportunity, particularly when they are puppies but also throughout their lives. If this is not done, you may find that your once calm and confident Afghan Hound becomes introverted and skittish around strangers. Though your Afghan Hound will tend to get on well with other dogs, they are born hunters with a high prey drive and should therefore never be trusted with smaller animals.","The Afghan hound is a large dog with an elegant, refined look. The head is long, with a slight stop and features a top knot of hai. The nose is most commonly black but may be a liver shade in lighter dogs. The eyes are triangular and can be either dark or golden, though the dark shade is preferred among breeders. The ears are low set and carried close to the head, hanging low. A strong jaw meets in a perfect scissor bite. A long neck slopes down into strong, muscular yet lean shoulders. The forelegs are straight and the hind legs powerful. The tail should not be too short and should be curved and carried high. The Afghan Hound’s signature coat is long, silky, straight and fine.","The Afghan Hound can come in any colour, or any mix of colours however the most common shades are golden and black","Your Afghan Hound is an incredibly intelligent dog, however he is also extremely independent and can be stubborn and strong willed. Therefore, although he is quick to learn, he has a low level of obedience. So, while he may know what you want him to do, you may still have trouble getting him to do it. Therefore, an experienced dog owner who can show the Afghan Hound authority, consistency and commitment is best suited to this breed.","Your Afghan Hound is an incredibly high maintenance dog. His special coat needs special care. Daily brushing is an absolute necessity as the fine, long hair can become tangled and matted very easily. Your Afghan’s coat also requires regular bathing with specialist shampoos and conditioners – show dogs need to be bathed every four or five days when they transition from the fluffy puppy coat to the long adult coat.","The average lifespan of the Afghan Hound is between 9 and 15 years. The Afghan Hound is a generally hardy and robust dog, though they are prone to a few major health issues including cancer, allergies and hip dysplasia. Due to their low amount of body fat, the Afghan Hound is also very sensitive to anaesthesia, like many breeds of sight hound.","('Hound',)",Families Couples Hair stylists People who are active Ramblers and hikers Joggers,Dignified and elegant Luxurious coat Active The Aristocrat Fast Loves to run
Airedale Terrier,Small: Weight Male 44 – 50 lb (20 – 23 kg) Female 44 – 50 lb (20 – 23 kg) Height Male 22 – 23” (56 – 59 cm) Female 22 – 23” (56 – 59 cm),"Originating from the area surrounding the River Aire in Yorkshire, England, the Airedale Terrier dates back to the early 1800s. Living near the river, and being derived from the old English Black and Tan Terrier and the Otterhound, the Airedale was originally called the Waterside Terrier. The name Airedale Terrier comes from the Valley of Aire, where the breed comes from. The breed was commonly used in the Aire Valley to hunt foxes, badgers, otters, weasels and water rats. It wasn’t until 1879 that the breed was given the name Airedale Terrier when the dogs were shown in classes in the Airedale Agricultural Show. This distinguished them from the many different breeds of Waterside Terrier. The Airedale Terrier was popular among farmers who needed a versatile dog who was small enough to work as a ratter but big enough to hunt larger wildlife. Therefore, the Airedale Terrier was bred to be taller and leggier than most terriers and he also has superior swimming and scent tracking skills in comparison to other terrier breeds. Their versatile nature and excellent chasing and tracking abilities soon found the Airedale Terriers as police and military dogs, and they were most commonly used in these positions during the First World War. As well as tracking down criminals, Airedales began to hunt much larger game. They were not only used on hunting expeditions in the UK, USA and Canada, but were taken on wild safari style hunts in India. The Airedale Terrier’s distinctive look, intelligent character and eagerness to learn has also found the breed in a number of films and television shows, and is a big hit in Hollywood. The showmanship of the Airedale has also helped him create a strong presence in dog shows.","Your Airedale Terrier is extremely intelligent, eager to please you and wonderfully loyal. Airedale Terriers tend to be aloof with most people, but with their owners they show a playful and fun loving side and can be fantastically affectionate and loving. Your Airedale Terrier is a great family dog when he is properly socialised with children from a young age. He will love playing with older children who can respect his boundaries and he thoroughly enjoys being part of family life – wherever you are going, you can be sure he’ll want to be there with you! It’s important to remember that, despite being a small dog, your Airedale Terrier is a dominant breed and must be properly trained and socialised throughout his life. They can show guarding behaviour around food and toys, as well as becoming snappy and irritated at times. Teaching basic manners and obedience should take place from an early age and be reinforced throughout adulthood. Airedale Terriers will usually get on well with other dogs, particularly submissive breeds, but due to their hunting instincts and high prey drive they will not be well suited to households with non-canine pets.","Your Airedale has a typical terrier’s temperament. He is very head strong and can be stubborn and wilful due to his strong independent streak. Males tend to be more stubborn than females, though any Airedale terrier that has not been well trained and socialised at an early age will show a stubborn or bossy side. While the Airedale is intelligent and quick to learn, training can still be a challenge because they are so independent. It’s important to ask any breeders about how well they have been socialised as young puppies when buying an Airedale Terrier puppy. Your Airedale Terrier is full of energy and of a very lively dog. He needs lots of mental and physical stimulation to keep him happy and relaxed and he’ll love getting the chance to run and chase wildlife in the great outdoors.","The largest Terrier in the UK, the Airedale Terrier has a relatively large and lean frame, with long legs. The head is long, flat and fairly narrow with a long muzzle. The ears are dropped and fold forward while the eyes are small, dark and V shaped. The strong neck slopes down to meet a short back. The chest is deep while the tail points straight up. The Airedale Terrier coat is wiry, short and coarse and the face features longer hair on the lower jaw, creating a beard.","Airedale Terrier’s coats are commonly tan with a black saddle, tail and occasionally ears. They may also show red markings.","Terriers are generally not easy to train, but the Airedale is one of the easiest breeds of Terrier to teach obedience to. Airedale Terriers can be stubborn, but they are also highly intelligent and will pick up new things quickly when their owner shows authority. Your Airedale Terrier needs you to show confidence and be firm yet fair. In order to keep your Airedale interested in his training sessions, they must be short, intense and fun. Positive, reward based training is key to training your Airedale Terrier to be a polite and well behaved dog. Airedales can become easily distracted, so they are best suited to an experienced dog owner and obedience classes are recommended for the breed.","Your Airedale Terrier’s coat needs brushing with a stiff bristle brush every two to three days, in order to remove the dead hair which can accumulate and become matted. The undercoat should be hand stripped twice a year and bathing should take place only when necessary. Very minimal trimming is needed and the Airedale Terrier is a low shedding breed, making them a possibility as a pet for allergy sufferers.","The Airedale Terrier is a very robust dog with a low susceptibility to illness. However, Airedale Terriers have been known to suffer from eye problems, skin infections and hip dysplasia. Bloat, a common health problem for dogs, is also an issue. Cancer is the most common cause of death in Airedale Terriers, followed by old age.

Akita,Large: Weight Male 75 – 110 lb (34 – 50 kg) Female 75 – 110 lb (34 – 50 kg Height Male 26 – 28” (66 – 71 cm) Female 24 – 26” (61 – 66 cm),"The Akita is the largest breed of Japanese dog, Originating from Japan’s Akita province in the 1600s, the Akita was bred to hunt to game such as deer, wild boar and black bears, which gives some idea of the power behind the Akita. Some experts even believe that the Akita was specifically bred for pit fighting but when the sport of dog fighting lost popularity in Japan, the dogs were put to work as a hunting breed. When the German Shepherd and Pointer were imported into Japan in the late 1800s, many native Japanese breeds suffered in popularity including the Akita. In addition, a large outbreak of rabies almost wiped out the Akita. The Society for Preservation of Japanese Dogs was formed in order to work to preserve the Japanese breeds. During World War II, the Akita once again came close to extinction as many of the dogs were killed for their meat and fur. However, after the war the breed was re-established in Japan and much further afield as American officers and soldiers brought many Akitas back to the United States with them. When brought to North America, the dogs were bred to be much larger, heavy boned and with a larger head. This variety of the breed is known as the American Akita and has loosely curled tail, loose skin, black mask and black markings. The Japanese Akita and American Akita are now considered to be different breeds. The Japanese Akita is smaller with a foxy look and white, red and brindle coloured coats.","The Akita isn’t like other hounds and sporting dogs as it wasn’t bred to live and work in a pack. Therefore, it is happiest as the only dog in the household or one of just two dogs in a family. Your Akita can show a lot of aggression towards dogs and other animals which are not part of his family and his hunting instinct means that he should not be trusted around smaller non-canine animals. Your Akita will be totally devoted to his family and will adore receiving your attention and affection. They are very protective over children in the family, but wary of children and people outside the family unit. As your Akita is very territorial and protective of their families, they make excellent guard and watch dogs. They are wonderfully alert and always taking in their surroundings. Your Akita is a large dog with a lot of energy, so will be happiest when well exercised on a daily basis. However, the issue this breed has with dog aggression means they should not be allowed off leash.","Your Akita is a powerful and dominant breed of dog and very intelligent. Akita owners must show strength, an air of authority and confidence around their Akita at all times to ensure that they do not become bossy or think that they rule the household. A well behaved Akita is one which is relaxed, well exercised and knows his place in the family. Though they need firm obedience training, they must not be trained using harsh or heavy handed methods. Consistent, positive training is the best way to make your Akita polite and well balanced. When your Akita is happy and content he will be affectionate, loving and faithful, making him a lovely family pet. The Akita’s temperament can be compared to that of a cat’s – he can think for himself and will show independence as well as being incredibly clean. It is not unusual for your Akita to clean his face after eating.","The Akita has a large, strong and muscular frame. The head is large, long and flat with a broad forehead. The jaw should be powerful and meet in a scissor bite. The eyes are comparatively small, dark brown and almond shaped while the ears are small and triangular, carried erect over the eyes and rounded at the tips. The thick, muscled neck is short and reaches similarly strong shoulders with right elbows. The forelegs are straight and the hindquarters show well developed thighs. The feet are large, thick and tight. The Akita’s tail should be large, full and set high, carried in a signature curl over the back. The Akita has a double coat which is a medium length. The inner coat is soft and dense while the outer coat is coarser and longer.","The Akita’s coat comes in any colour, but the most common shades are white, pinto and brindle.","The Akita is not well suited to inexperienced dog owners as these large dogs can be bossy, stubborn and even aggressive. Akitas are terribly dominant dogs and their owner must be firm yet also treat the Akita with love, respect and positivity. They must be trained from early puppyhood that they are not in charge and they also need intense socialisation from a very young age. Therefore, choose your breeder carefully when picking a puppy and be sure to ask the breeder what training and socialisation the puppy has had. An Akita with a submissive owner can be overpowering. Teaching your Akita that he is subordinate to you and the rest of your family is the first and most important step when it comes to training. Keep obedience training sessions fun and give him plenty of praise and love. You should never punish or be harsh with your Akita, so positive reinforcement is the only way to train this breed.",Your Akita’s coat should be brushed once every week with a comb and steel pin brush or a firm bristle brush. The coat doesn’t need to be trimmed or clipped and should be bathed only when necessary as it can damage the coat’s waterproof coating. The undercoat will shed or ‘blow’ once or twice per year and during this time it is a good idea to brush your Akita every day. This will both control and speed up the shedding process. Akitas which live indoors or in colder climates tend to shed less.,"The Akita has an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years. They are generally a healthy breed, though they are susceptible to a few health conditions. Acquired Myathenia Gravis can occur in Akitas; this condition destroys proteins in the muscle surface where nerves are attached. Bloat, eye conditions and hip dysplasia are also issues for the Akita.","('Utility',)",Experienced dog owners A-type personalities Families People who are very active Hikers and ramblers,Affectionate and loving Fearless Independent Cat like Highly protective
Alaskan Malamute,Large: Weight Male 84 – 123 lb (38 – 56 kg) Female 84 – 123 lb (38 – 56 kg) Height Male 25 – 28” (64 – 71 cm) Female 23 – 26” (58 – 66 cm),"Originating from Northwestern Alaska and dating back around 2000 years, the Malamute was developed by a tribe of Inuit called the Mahlemuts who needed a dog which could cope with the extreme cold weather and hauling heavy loads like food and supplies, whilst also being a skilled hunter. The breed was created from a mix of Russian Samoyed, Siberian Husky, Labrador and the Eskimo dogs of Greenland. There is a common myth that the Malamute is descended from the Arctic Wolf, however this is in fact not true. The Malamute is not a hybrid of dog and wolf and attempting to breed Malamutes with wolves is firmly discouraged. The Malamute has an important part in history, as it assisted on the polar expeditions undertaken by explorers Perry, Cook and Byrd. They were integral to pulling heavy loads on the expeditions. The Malamute is not a fast dog and it is more used for power and strength than speed. During the gold rush era in America, some breeders tried to make the Malamute quicker by breeding it with speedier Arctic dogs, but breed enthusiasts such as the Seeleys worked hard to purify the breed and return it to its original breed standard and slow, strong pace.","Your Alaskan Malamute is a loveable, charming, people loving dog. Malamutes will make friends with anyone and everyone, and love to play. Their friendly nature means they don’t make good watch or guard dogs, but they are fantastically sociable around your guests and visitors and wonderful with children. Your Malamute’s strong prey drive means that he should be supervised around smaller animals and non-canine pets. Though a playful dog, Alaskan Malamutes tend to mature into mellow, relaxed and easy going pets that are a content member of the family and cause little trouble. Your Malamute was bred to work and the breed was originally used to haul sleds and freight, so they need a substantial amount of exercise and mental stimulation. This is not a breed that will live happily as a couch potato, so owners need to be prepared to take their Malamute on long and vigorous walks – jogging is even better! Due to their size and energy they are not suitable for life in an apartment and will do best in a house with a large enclosed garden. Be sure to install a high fence with a buried base as your Malamute loves to explore and dig.","Your Alaskan Malamute is a true pack dog and hates to be left alone. If you will not be able to stay with your dog throughout the day, then a Malamute is not a suitable breed for your lifestyle as he will become stressed, anxious and upset leading to behaviour problems such as destruction. Generally, Alaskan Malamutes get on well with other dogs but they may show dominance to dogs of the same gender. Despite the Malamute’s wolf like appearance your Malamute is wonderfully gentle and can be trusted around children, though they should be trained to treat children with particular care and not be left unsupervised while with children. As your Malamute was bred to be a working dog and he has a lot of energy to burn up, he will thoroughly enjoy agility classes. It’s important to train your Alaskan Malamute from an early age and to teach him that he is not dominant over the rest of the household. These dogs are large and require a confident owner who will show the Malamute an air of authority in order to create a submissive, content pet who shows respect. Most Malamutes are fairly quiet, however they do like to occasionally howl or let out a ‘woo woo’ sound which is typical for the breed.","The Alaskan Malamute is often mistaken for the Siberian Husky. The breed shows a sturdy, substantial, powerful and large frame. The head is broad with a faint furrow between the eyes, which are almond shaped and brown. Triangular ears stand erect and the nose is usually brown but may also be streaked in lighter coloured dogs. The muzzle’s length and depth is almost uniform throughout and the large teeth meet in a scissor bite. The body is heavily boned and well-muscled with a deep, strong chest and strong, slightly arched neck. The tail has a plume like appearance which follows the line of the spine and is used by the dog to wrap around the face and body during cold weather. The Alaskan Malamute’s coat has a thick and coarse outer coat of a moderate length and oily, dense undercoat. The coat was originally used to protect the Malamute from harsh, snowy conditions in Alaska.","The Alaskan Malamute’s coat commonly ranges from light grey to shadings of black, but also comes in sable to shadings of sable and red. The face markings are a distinguishing feature of the breed and show a cap over the head with a white face that may be marked with a bar or mask.","Your Alaskan Malamute will be a pleasure to train providing you use the correct training methods and show him you’re in charge. This is because he is not only highly intelligent but also loves to please his family. However, as your Malamute is a dominant breed he needs an owner who will be firm, consistent and confident with training otherwise he will be unlikely to listen and show obedience to you. Positive, reward based training with plenty of praise and affection will yield the best results from your Malamute as well as creating a well-mannered, polite and happy pet.","Your Malamute’s heavy coat requires a good amount of grooming in order to keep it healthy. Daily brushing is an absolute necessity, and you may even want to brush him more than once a day when he goes through the shedding seasons which occur twice each year. Baths generally aren’t necessary with the Alaskan Malamute as his coat is resistant to dirt and bathing can actually harm the protective coating the coat has. Dry shampooing every other month should be enough to keep his coat clean. Be sure to brush his teeth a few times per week and trim the nail regularly as they grow.","The Alaskan Malamute is a generally healthy breed, though dogs in the UK tend to suffer from more health problems than elsewhere, such as the USA, as they were bred from a smaller gene pool. Hip dysplasia can be an issue for the Malamute as can chrondodysplasia and polyneuropathy, a condition in which issues occur with muscle tone and weakness. Cataracts and vision problems are a known problem for older Alaskan Malamutes. The average lifespan of the Alaskan Malamute is between 9 and 15 years.","('Working',)",People who live in cold climates County folk People who enjoy the outdoors Active people Families Experienced dog owners,Gentle giant Loyal Affectionate and loving Playful yet mellow Eager to please Wolf like appearance

The Spanish Spaniel is the oldest type of Spaniel and was bred to be a hunting and retrieving dog. The Spanish traded and gave away their Spaniels as gifts, spreading them to England. It is thought that the first spaniel to arrive in America cam e in on the Mayflower with the Pilgrim Fathers in 1620. As more settlers arrived, more spaniels were brought into the country to help the people explore and scout out the country. The spaniel was an English Cocker and the modern day American Cocker Spaniel was developed from this breed during the 19th Century. At first, the American Cocker was distinguished from the English Cocker based solely on size. As breeding continued and the breed became purer, more differences were seen between the two spaniel breeds. In 1935 breeders established the English Cocker Spaniel Club and discouraged breeding between the two varieties. By the 1940s the two breeds could not be judged together in shows as they were so vastly different, and in 1945 the American and English Spaniels were separated and given their own distinctive breed standards.","Bred to be hunters and retrievers, American Cocker Spaniels thoroughly enjoy working as gundogs however they also make lovely pets for homes which do not partake in hunting or have need of a sporting dog. Your American Cocker Spaniel is charming, friendly and sociable. He loves to be around his family and other dogs and animals and gets on well with everyone. American Cocker Spaniels are very playful, but also sensitive and gentle which makes them excellent pets for families with children. As they are such sociable dogs, American Cocker Spaniels need an owner who won’t leave them alone for long periods of time as they will become bored, stressed and may resort to destructive behaviour such as chewing, and excessive barking.","Your American Cocker Spaniel is wonderfully intelligent, ranking 20th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs, making him an easy dog to train.  Tests carried out in the 1950s and 1960s also showed that the breed is excellent at showing restraint, a skill which was most likely bred into him in order to create his ability to freeze while hunting game so as not to scare it off. A very happy and joyful dog, your American Cocker Spaniel seems to always be wagging his tail in jubilance. However, he is also sensitive and can be frightened of loud noises, rough treatment or harsh tones of voice – so you need to be gentle around your American Cocker and treat him with respect. Your American Cocker Spaniel is very curious and can be mischievous, demanding a lot of their owner’s time, attention and affection. Patience is a must for American Cocker Spaniel owners.","The American Cocker has a relatively small frame with good proportions. The head is well developed and rounded while the muzzle is broad and squarely shaped. Strong jaws meet in a perfect scissor bite. Round eyes are dark and large while the ears are long and hang down. The strong neck leads to a deep chest with well sprung ribs. The legs are fairly short, but strong and well boned, leading to round and compact feet. The American Cocker’s tail is carried in line with the back, though it may be carried slightly higher than this. The American Cocker Spaniel has a long, silky coat which may be flat or slightly waved. The hair is shorter on the head, while the ears, chest and legs should be well feathered.","The American Cocker Spaniel’s coat can come in three colour varieties – black, any solid colour other than black (ASCOB) and parti-colours. The black shade can be either entirely black or show tan markings on the head feet and tail, called black and tan. ASCOB types can be any solid colour from pale cream to dark red, occasionally lighter colouring on the feathering may be allowed. Parti-coloured coats are white with coloured marking such as black or brown. Parti-coloured also includes roan coloured dogs, which are rare. Merle shades of American Cocker Spaniel are also seen, but are not recognised by most Kennel Clubs.","American Cocker Spaniels tend to be quite easy dogs to train, which helps attribute to their immense popularity. Be sure to train your American Cocker consistently and from a young age in order to let him reach his full potential and for you to end up with a polite, obedient and well-mannered dog. They can be sensitive, so use reward based, positive training methods with your American Cocker and never speak to him harshly or treat him severely.","The American Cocker Spaniel’s coat needs a great deal of maintenance in order to keep it healthy and free from mattes and knots. A thorough brush every day and regular trims are necessary. In addition, it is important to bathe the American Cocker Spaniel frequently to keep his coat and skin clean as well as minimise odour. As your American Cocker is prone to ear infections, his ears must be checked and cleaned often. The lips should also be checked for signs of infection and the teeth require regular cleaning to avoid decay. Particular attention should be given to the feet as the hair can become matted and dried mud can become stuck in the hair there. Health:","American Cocker Spaniels have an average lifespan of around 10 to 11 years, which is low for a pedigree breed as well as one or two years less than most other breeds of the same size. The most common causes of death are cancer, old age and cardiac in nature. Immune-mediated issues are also a leading cause of death. The high popularity of the breed has led to puppy mills and backyard breeders breeding the American Cocker Spaniel, leading to health issues in certain bloodlines. The American Cocker Spaniel is particularly prone to ear and eye infections such as retinal atrophy, glaucoma and cataracts. Autoimmune disorders have also been noted in the breed, including haemolytic anaemia. Luxating patella and hip dysplasia have also been seen. Heart conditions which the American Cocker Spaniel is susceptible to include dilated cardiomyopathy (a weakened and enlarged heart) and sick sinus syndrome, which causes low blood pressure. The genetic disease Phosphofructokinase deficiency is also seen in American Cockers and prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, creating a very low energy and fatigued dog that cannot exercise. American Cocker Spaniels are also prone to epilepsy and rage syndrome, a form of epilepsy which can cause a well-mannered, relaxed dog to become suddenly violent without provocation.","('Gundog',)",Hikers and ramblers City or country folk Families Committed groomers Sociable people People who work from home,Sweet and gentle Sensitive Playful Loves everybody Friendly Excellent retriever Silky coat
American Eskimo Dog,Height: Toy: 9-12” (23-31 cm); Miniature: 12-15” (23-38 cm); Standard: 15-19” (38-48 cm),"Despite its name and appearance, the American Eskimo Dog originated in Germany. A member of the Spitz family, the breed was first named the German Spitz but this was swiftly changed due to anti-German prejudice during the First World War. Descended from a host of white European Sptizes—including the Keeshond, the Pomeranian, the German Spitz and the Italian Spitz—the American Eskimo Dog first cam to the United States in the early 1900s with German immigrants. Popular as a circus dogs due to their shiny coats, trainability and nimbleness, their name was officially changed in 1917.  An American Eskimo dog named Stout's Pal Pierre was famous for walking a tightrope with the Barnum and Bailey Circus in the 1930s, only further increasing the breed’s popularity. Many of today's American Eskimo Dogs can trace their lineage back to these circus dogs. There are three size varieties of the American Eskimo breed, the toy, miniature and the standard. They were originally bred to guard people and property and, therefore, are territorial by nature and make valiant watchdogs. While they are not considered to an aggressive breed, American Eskimos are generally quite vocal, barking at any stranger who comes within close proximity to their owners or their owner's territory. It should be noted that the American Eskimo Dog is not entirely an internationally recognized breed, and since neither of the American kennel clubs are affiliated with the Federation Cynologique International, financiers wishing to participate in certain international dog shows will register their American Eskimo Dogs as the very similar German Spitz. Although the American Eskimo is known as the German Spitz in several countries outside of the United States, the two breeds have actually developed somewhat differently.","Your American Eskimo is quite a strong character and is not recommended for first-time dog owners. They are an intelligent breed, and as well as being very alert, they have a tendency to demonstrate aggressive and dominant behaviour if not well trained and properly socialised. While they may require a firm hand, they make extremely rewarding companions. American Eskimo Dogs are very quick learners and are fantastic at learning tricks. They are very good at adapting their keen intelligence to tasks and projects. Strong-willed and independent, they are also gentle and happy pets, responsive to games and positive play. The American Eskimo Dog requires a large amount of exercise and needs to be walked regularly. They will be perfectly happy in apartments as long as they are kept active. The Toy Eskimo will generally have their exercise needs met through indoor play, while the Miniature and Standard varieties require daily securely leashed walks. The breed is well suited for apartment living provided that they are sufficiently physically exercised and mentally stimulated. They are most comfortable in cooler climates and need to be watched over during summer. American Eskimos are great with children. The species makes friends quickly but is cautious of strangers.","American Eskimo Dogs have been devoted companion dogs for centuries and love to be around people and be involved in family occasions. Left alone or neglected, their behaviour can become destructive and they tend to bark excessively. The best way to combat this separation anxiety is to insure that your dog is included in all activities. They do best in a home with older children who are considerate of their space. This breed generally does well with other pets provided they are of the same size of larger as they will attempt to dominate smaller pets. The American Eskimo dog is affectionate and excels as companion and guardian.","American Eskimo Dogs have beautiful white coats and resemble small Samoyeds. They have solid balanced frames with alert stances and gaits. Their heads should be wedge-shaped with medium-sized muzzles and skulls. Their lips, noses and eyelids are black. Their oval shaped eyes should feature an alert and intelligent expression and their triangle-shaped ears are always erect. The American Eskimo Dog has a thick, straight, double coat that creates a mane around the neck as well as a curled, heavily plumed tail. The outer coat is straight with long guard hair, while the under coat is thick and dense.",The American Eskimo Dog is white in colour.,"Training of the American Eskimo Dog must be done with firmness, fairness, patience, and consistency. Early socialisation and obedience is also recommended. The American Eskimo Dog is an intelligent breed that is highly adept at learning tricks. It is important to recognise that the American Eskimo Dog will not respond to harsh or heavy-handed training methods.",The American Eskimo Dog’s thick coat should be brushed several times per week with a firm bristle brush to prevent matting (more during shedding season). Bathing should be done only when necessary using a shampoo formulated for white-coated breeds. Nails should be trimmed.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 14 and 15 years, yet some live for as long as 16 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, if your American Eskimo Dog does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. This breed does tend to become overweight easily, so proper diet and exercise is needed to maintain an overall well being. All responsible breeders should perform health testing and anyone purchasing a puppy should be aware of the genetic problems that have been found in some individuals of the breed, such as progressive retinal atrophy, luxating patella, and hip dysplasia. However, none of these problems are common and the breed is generally very healthy. In addition to the less common problems mentioned, American Eskimo Dogs can have a tendency towards allergies and most commonly, tear-staining. They are also known in some cases to have dental issues. However, if you are careful who you buy from, your Golden Retriever should give you many years of good health, fun and loving companionship.","('Non-sporting',)",Singles Active types Families with older children Cold-climate dwellers,Intelligent Friendly Playful Independent
Anatolian Shepherd Dog,Extra Large: Weight Male 110 – 141 lb (50 – 64 kg) Female 90 – 130 lb (41 – 59 kg) Height Male 29 – 32” (74 – 82 cm) Female 28 – 31” (71 – 79 cm),"The Anatolian Shepherd Dog dates back over 5000 years and originates from Turkey, where it was used to herd and guard flocks of sheep. It was bred to have the ability to withstand Turkey’s rugged terrain and hot climate. The Anatolian Shepherd Dog was most likely descended from Roman War Dogs which were then imported into Turkey and Afghanistan. It is thought that they were originally used to hunt big game but were soon found to be amazing guardians of sheep as they could fight off large predators such as wolves and bears. The breed accompanied the nomadic shepherds of the region and as a result they spread far and wide, which attributes to the variations of size, coat and colour within the breed, as they bred with a variety of other breeds. Anatolian Shepherd Dogs were introduced in the west in the 1950s, but didn’t raise the interest of breeders until the seventies. Admiring breeders began to develop the Anatolian Shepherd Dog into a more modern breed by writing breed standards. In 1996, the American Kennel Club accepted the Anatolian Shepherd Dog into the Miscellaneous Class.","Bred to herd and protect flocks of sheep, your Anatolian Shepherd is an incredibly protective dog. They are naturally guarded with strangers until they know that they can be trusted and are watchful of their surroundings, making them excellent watch and guard dogs. Though they are not aggressive dogs, Anatolian Shepherds are very brave and courageous so will have no doubts about scaring off intruders or threats. Your Anatolian Shepherd will love his family deeply and remain completely devoted and loyal to you, but he needs a strong and confident owner or he will become dominant and try to rule the household. For this reason, Anatolian Shepherd Dogs are not well suited and are best with an experienced dog owner who will be confident around them and show their Anatolian Shepherd an air of authority. A stubborn and self-assured dog, your Anatolian Shepherd may be difficult to manage at times. If he doesn’t want to do what you want to do, he won’t do it! Early training and socialisation is very important in achieving an Anatolian Shepherd Dog who is well behaved, obedient and submissive to his owners. While some dominant behaviour, such as jumping on you, may seem cute and harmless when they are a puppy they are very large dogs when they get older and will be too strong to be corrected as he can easily overpower you. With the right training and socialisation they will mature into easy going, docile dogs.","Your Anatolian Shepherd Dog was bred to be able to cope on his own while guarding flocks of sheep, so for this reason he can be independent, stubborn and self-willed with a mind of his own. These are strong traits in your Anatolian Shepherd and make him a challenging pet to own and train. They are also incredibly intelligent and excellent problem solvers and they can run rings around their owners if allowed. As large dogs, they are not well suited to apartment life and this is further amplified by the fact that they love to roam. Patrolling their territory is inherent in your Anatolian Shepherd Dog as they were bred to be guardians, so having plenty of space for your Anatolian to wander and roam will be much appreciated by your dog. However, this also means that your Anatolian Shepherd Dog may wander off without you so it is vital that you microchip and tag your dog. Your Anatolian Shepherd Dog also loves to run and swim, though they have little interest in games such as fetch, or lying still in the home chewing toys. Though your Anatolian generally does well with children and enjoys their company, they should not be left unsupervised with children due to their size. It is best not to own other dogs when you own an Anatolian Shepherd Dog as they can show aggression to other dogs, particularly of the same sex, and they are also susceptible to fleas.","The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a muscular, very large breed. The head is large and broad with a strong muzzle. The eyes can be golden to brown colours and are relatively small in proportion to the head while the nose is always black. Triangular ears are carried flat to the head. A thick neck leads do a deep chest with well sprung ribs. The forelegs are heavily boned and set well apart, while the hind quarters are lighter yet very powerful. The tail is carried low when the dog is relaxed and calm and carried high when the dog is alert or excited. The Anatolian Shepherd Dog has a thick double coat which is flat and lies close to the body. It has a slightly wiry, coarse texture and is a little bit thicker around the neck, shoulders and tail.",The Anatolian Shepherd Dog’s coat should be a cream to fawn colour. The most common shades are white cream and sesame. White cream dogs may feature coloured spots on their body. All colours may show a black mask and/or ears.,"Your Anatolian Shepherd Dog is highly intelligent and therefore has the ability to learn very quickly should he be inclined to do so. The challenge lies in his independent nature and stubborn streak, which means that he may not want to learn. Therefore, an owner who is experienced with dogs and can show confidence and authority as well as fairness, respect and consistency is vital. Training should be fun and reward based in order to stop your Anatolian Shepherd Dog from becoming distracted or bored. Give him plenty of praise and affection and never treat him harshly or severely. Your Anatolian Shepherd Dog is naturally a very protective dog and this comes to him naturally. You should not encourage or try to train your Anatolian Shepherd Dog to be more protective as this will leave to over protectiveness in unreasonable situations","Your Anatolian Shepherd Dog’s coat is very low maintenance and requires minimal grooming. During the shedding seasons your dog will shed heavily and need daily brushing to prevent mattes from forming. However, outside of the shedding season they will only need a weekly brush and can even get away with just having a rub down with a rubber glove or a cloth.","The Anatolian Shepherd Dog tends to have a low immunity that takes a while to develop and therefore can pick up diseases and viruses more than other breeds. They are also prone to hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism and eyelid entropion. The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is also sensitive to anaesthesia.

The Australian Cattle Dog rivalled dogs exported by settlers from Europe that were not able to handle the long distances and inhospitable climate of the new continent. In response, Australian, George Elliott created a cattle dog, by crossing Dingo-blue merle Collies with Dalmatians and black and tan Kelpies.

    ‘The Australian Shepherd Dog is widely known as ‘The Aussie’. However, it has had many names in the past including the Pastor Dog, Blue Heeler, Spanish Shepherd, Bob-Tail, New Mexican Shepherd, and California Shepherd Breed History: Despite the misleading name, the Australian Shepherd is not Australian at all, but was developed most likely in the Pyrenees Mountains somewhere between Spain and France, and refined in the U.S. to work as a herding dog on ranches. The breed's principal forebears were most likely Spanish dogs that accompanied the Basque shepherds and herds of fine Merino sheep exported to both America and Australia in the early days of the colonies. Australian Shepherds became more popular in the mid-twentieth century. They were favourites of ranchers and cowboys for their unique herding talents, but did not enter the American Kennel Club Stud Book until 1991. Character: Australian Shepherds are intelligent, delightful, and loyal. They are highly energetic and thrive on being given something to do. They have a high degree of intensity and a ""no-quit"" attitude. Their herding instinct may be problematic or annoying to their family, as this breed will often attempt to perform this task on everyone or anything that moves. Australian Shepherds are easy-going, remaining puppy-like even in their adult years. This courageous dog makes a good watchdog for the home. Aussies are excellent with children, even with an active child, as they love to play. A devoted, loyal friend and guardian, for they are naturally protective. They are eager to please, with a sixth sense about what the owner wants. Australian Shepherds are highly intelligent and easy to train. Its many talents include, retrieving, herding, watchdog, guarding, police work, narcotics detection, search & rescue, agility, competitive obedience and performing tricks. Temperament: Australian Shepherds can be a little standoffish at first. Given time, however, they will become comfortable with new people and come out of their shells. They have excellent guarding instincts and a strong sense of loyalty to their families. Australian Shepherds will bark when strangers approach the house, and they’ll sometimes run a few laps around the house for good measure. Some Australian Shepherds retain strong working-dog genes. This makes them more eager to be in the field and less eager to hang out with the family. These dogs are more inclined to herd people and nip at heels to keep everyone moving, but with proper training these quirks can be worked out. Whilst aggressive when at work with livestock, the Aussie is gentle with human friends. Australian Shepherds are not the kind of dog to lay around the living room all day or live happily in the backyard with only a fifteen-minute walk. They need much more exercise than that and something to occupy their mind daily or they will become bored, leading to serious behaviour problems. Without enough mental and physical exercise and or a lack of a true pack leader, they can become nervous and destructive if left alone. Socialize well to prevent them from becoming suspicious of strangers. Conformation: The Australian Shepherds most identifiable characteristic is the natural or docked bobtail. Their eyes are one of this breeds most commented on feature. Their eyes come in a variety of colours or colour combinations and include blue, amber, hazel, and all shades of brown. Their ears are triangular and set high, their chests are deep and their tails are straight and naturally short. They have a weather-resistant coat with a moderate texture, creating a little bit of a mane. Overall, Australian Shepherds have strong, square and balanced frames. Their coats are of moderate length, straight to wavy and weather resistant. The under coat tends to shed twice a year with moderate shedding between these periods. Hair is short and smooth on the head, outside of the ears, front of the forelegs and below the hocks. Backs of the forelegs are moderately feathered; breeches are moderately full. There is a moderate mane and frill, which is more pronounced in male dogs than females. The front legs are straight, perpendicular to the ground. The feet are oval, compact with close knit, well-arched toes. The front dewclaws are sometimes removed, but back dewclaws are almost always removed Colour: The breed’s coat comes in four accepted colours: black, blue merle, red, and red merle. A variety of white and tan markings may appear on the face, chest, front, and rear legs. Training: Australian Shepherds are easy to train. They benefit from early socialization and very basic obedience. It is important that they know who the master is or they will attempt to take control. The Australian Shepherd requires firm, fair, consistent, and effective direction. Their high intelligence and keen learning ability make repetitive training boring. Care: The Australian Shepherd requires minimal grooming. An occasional brushing with a firm bristle brush will suffice. It is important to do more in depth grooming when they are going through their seasonal shedding. Bathing should only be done when absolutely necessary. Health: The Australian Shepherd Dog is susceptible to a myriad of health issues and concerns. The gene for the beautiful merle coloration also carries a blind and deaf factor. This may be expressed only in merle/merle crosses. Be sure to check the hearing on merle puppies. Natural bobtails can result in some offspring with serious spinal defects. They are also prone to epilepsy, hip dysplasia, cataracts and hypothyroidism. A healthy Australian Shepherd can live as long as 15 years and mother an average litter size of 6-9 puppies.

Australian Silky Terrier,not available,"The ancestors of the Australian Silky Terrier include the Yorkshire Terrier (originally from Scotland before being considered to be from England) and the Australian Terrier (which descends from the rough coated type terriers brought from Great Britain to Australia in the early 19th century. Few records indicate whether early dogs were just Australian Terriers born with silky fur, or whether there was an attempt to create a separate breed. According to the American Kennel Club, the breed began at the end of the 19th century when Yorkshire Terriers were crossed with the Australian Terriers. At first the breed was known as the Sydney Silky, as it was found primarily in the city of Sydney, Australia. Although most other Australian breeds were working dogs, the Silky Terrier was bred primarily to be an urban pet and companion, although it is also known for killing snakes in Australia. Up until 1929 the Australian Silky Terrier, the Australian Terrier and the Yorkshire Terrier were not clearly defined. Dogs of three different breeds might be born in the same litter, to be separated by appearance into the different types once they were grown. After 1932 in Australia, further crossbreeding was discouraged, and in 1955 the breed's name officially became the Australian Silky Terrier. The breed was recognised by the Australian National Kennel Council in 1958 in the Toy Group. During and after World War II American servicemen that had been stationed in Australia brought Silky Terriers back to the United States. In 1954, newspaper photographs of the breed caused an upsurge of popularity and hundreds of Silkies were imported from Australia to the United States. The American Kennel Club recognised the breed as the Silky Terrier in 1959, as did the United Kennel Club (US) in 1965 where it is shown as a Terrier; it is also recognised as the Silky Terrier by the Canadian Kennel Club.",,"The ideal Australian Silky Terrier temperament is keenly alert and active. They love to be given chances to run and play, but must have a tightly fenced yard. The Silky is able to do well in an apartment. However, it is important they are kept busy and social to discourage boredom. A recent survey ranked the Silky Terrier in the top 20 in learning the quickest of small canines. The Silky Terrier is the best of both worlds temperament wise. They love to sit on your lap and do ""toy dog"" things but have an easy going Terrier personality ready for just about any activity.","The Australian Silky Terrier is a small and compact short-legged terrier. A long silky grey and white or blue and tan coat is their identifying feature, hanging straight and parted along the back, and described as ""flat, fine and glossy"". All proportions and aspects of the body and head as well as desirable shades of grey and white and placement of markings are extensively described in the breed standard. The Silky Terrier should be slightly longer than tall. This is a dog that was historically used for hunting and killing rodents and snakes, so its body should have enough substance to fit this role. The Silky Terrier has a strong, wedge-shaped head. The eyes are small and almond-shaped. According to the standards, light-coloured eyes are considered a fault. The ears are small and carried erect. The Silky Terrier has a high-set tail and small, almost catlike, feet. The coat should be long, but not so long to approach floor length. The hair on the face and ears is normally cut",,"Take care to socialize this breed well, particularly if they will be around children.","The Silky is a hardy dog and little special care is needed. Providing they are fed on a well balanced diet and given a reasonable amount of exercise then all should be well. The coat requires moderate shampooing to retain its silkiness. The Silky Terrier's coat is highly susceptible to tangles and matting so requires daily brushing and combing. This breed requires a deep commitment from the owners. To keep the coat lustrous, regular shampooing is necessary. Using an Avocado and Oatmeal Shampoo will help alleviate the itchy, dry skin of this breed. This particular breed should have its teeth brushed and be groomed every three weeks. Care should also be taken with grooming near the neck area and a harness leash should be used to protect the Silky Terrier from tracheal collapse.","Generally free of major congenital health issues. However, the Terrier breed is known to have teeth and gum problems. On average, the lifespan of an Australian Silk Terrier is between12-15 years. This breed requires little exercise and is perfect for short runs and ball play. It is better to buy a plastic ball instead of a cotton ball as they tend to bite and chew the cotton out. It is recommended to play catch with it at least once a day.",not available,Families Singles City dwellers Outdoorsy types,Loves attention Values independence Sensitive Loyal
Basenji,Height: Male Dogs 16-17 inches (41-43 cm.) Female Dog 15-16 inches (38-41 cm.) Weight: Male Dogs 22-26 pounds (10-12 kg.) Bitches 20-25 pounds (9-11 kg.),"The Basenji is an ancient breed: the first traces of a dog like it were discovered in Egyptian tombs and wall drawings. The breed was used in central Africa for thousands of years. Basenjis were valued by African hunters for their quickness, intelligence and silence. They were used for a host of duties, such as, guides in the forest, retrieving, pointing, tracking and herding. The first Basenjis taken to Europe in the 19th century did not survive. However, in 1937 these unique dogs were introduced in England and America, drawing huge crowds and causing a sensation. English breeders refined it and exported it all over the world. The first litter of Basenji puppies were born and raised to maturity in the USA in 1941. The breed gained recognition from the American Kennel Club in 1944.","Basenjis may have an illustrious hunting pedigree, but they can get very comfortable at home. In fact, Basenjis will sometimes sleep the day away. When they wake up, however, watch out: These dogs love to play, explore and run. Even if you’re not in the mood to play, your Basenji will find a way to coax you out of your chair. Their intelligence and craftiness is second to none. Basenji is a sight hound, hunting by sight only. They have very strong hunting instincts that persuade them to chase after anything; they love to chase after cars. The Basenji can be somewhat aloof around strangers making him a very suspicious breed. He is very alert, rambunctious and playful making him a lovely family pet, however as mentioned, this breed does love the outdoors and does best with acreage. Basenjis don’t bark—a plus for some dog owners—but keep in mind that they do make some very interesting sounds. Depending on their mood, they will howl, scream or yodel. Basenjis also make human-like facial expressions—furrowing their brows when they sense danger or raising their eyebrows when they get worried.","Taking into account that their ancestors practically lived in the bush hunting and tracking, Basenjis are a mix of cleverness, resourcefulness and independence. They know how to take care of themselves, but they also love human companionship and togetherness. Basenjis form very strong bonds with their masters. So don’t be fooled by their lone-wolf nature: Basenjis are people-oriented dogs. If neglected or excluded from family occasions, they can get depressed. Sometimes this can lead to destructiveness. If left alone in the back yard for hours on end, a Basenji can easily dig up a garden or figure out a way to jump the fence. The Basenji is a very alert and fun loving breed, however is not recommended for an inexperienced owner. Whilst Basenjis can be very patient and good with children, it is important that they are socialized early to prevent the tendencies to fight with other dogs.","Basenjis are smooth, muscular, athletic dogs on the small side. The head is wrinkled around the forehead and the muzzle is shorter than the skull. Their alert heads have tapered muzzles, almond-shaped eyes, dark noses, and wrinkled foreheads that sometimes give them a worried look. The ears are straight, small, erect and open in the front. The dog's back is level and the legs are straight. They have long necks that slope down to short backs. Their tails curl over, and they walk with a kind of horse-like trot. Overall, Basenjis carry themselves with gracefulness and readiness. As mentioned the Basenji does not bark, but rather makes a yodel noise. They also howl, growl and crow, depending on the dog's mood.","The coat is short, shiny and fine and comes in pure black, copper, red, chestnut red, or tricolour in combinations of black, tan and white, or black, brindle and white. The American Kennel Club standard calls for the dog to have white on the feet, chest and tip of the tail. White legs, blaze and collar are optional.","The Basenji is very intelligent, responds well to training with a strong desire to please. THEY should be socialized early to prevent any destruction problems if he is to be home raised, and to ensure that he will do well around children and other animals. Obedience training is a must for this energetic and very alert breed. This breed should have a variety of training methods to keep his attention, as he tends to bore quickly. Variety, consistency, and firm handling work best with the Basenji.","The Basenji is much like a cat in cleanliness and grooms himself on occasion. This is a little to no shedding breed, however does require some grooming if the coat is to stay in good shape. An occasional brushing with a firm bristle or wire brush works best to remove dead or loose hair from the coat. The smooth coat of the Basenji is very easy to care for. The Basenji tends to clean himself making the coat very easy to care for and relatively clean. This breed has little to no doggy smell. This is a good dog for people with allergies.","Common health issues that can occur in the Basenji include Fanconi Syndrome (a kidney ailment, which must be treated the moment the symptoms are noticed), in addition to hip, eye and intestinal problems. Basenjis are clean animals.  Less common health concerns that may possibly occur include persistent pupillary syndrome (PPS), Hypothyroidism and umbilical hernia. Basenjis need lots of exercise to stay mentally and physically fit. They have a tendency to become fat and lazy unless the owner is consistent about it. Several walks a day will suit them and they make superb jogging partners. But always remember to keep them on a leash. The Basenji will do okay in an apartment if it gets enough exercise. They are very active indoors and a small yard will do. However, yards must be fenced. The fence should be planted deeply into the ground and high to prevent escape as this breed can be an escape artist if proper precautions are not ensured. The Basenji is happiest when it is kept with two or three other Basenjis; they will not fight among themselves. A healthy Basenji can live as 12 years, producing an average litter size of 4-6 puppies. A female Basenji comes into heat once a year, where as most other breeds are twice a year.","('Southern Hound – Category: Small',)",Families with older children Hunters Sportsmen Experienced dog handlers,Inquisitive Active Loyal Reserved Athletic
Basset Fauve de Bretagne,not available,"The Basset Fauve De Bretagne is an excellent bloodhound, originally bred to hunt in packs with French Royalty. Essentially a scent hound, the Basset Fauve De Bretagne is descended from the now-extinct Grand Fauve De Bretagne, a large hunting hound used in the ancient kingdom of Brittany in France. Bred to be a useful hunting dog, the basset is the smallest of the Fauve De Bretagne breed. It’s speculated that Basset numbers were so low in France following World War II; the Fauve De Bretagne had to be rescued by using some of the remaining animals and crossing these with other types (these include ‘The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen’ as well as the wirehaired Dachshund). The Kennel Club in France, however, maintain that this is not the case and that numbers were never small enough to warrant genetic input from other breeds. Many experts suggest that the Grand Fauve De Bretagne was brought to the UK in the 16th Century to strengthen existing hunting packs in England and Wales. Again, there is little documented evidence to support this. Although hounds that resemble the Grand – particularly in Welsh foxhound packs can still sometimes be seen.","Basset Fauves are affectionate, playful little dogs, which make great pets and are very good with children. However, it must be remembered that they are hunting animals and never really lose their love of the chase. In light of this, they may not suit everybody. An interesting characteristic of the breed is that they can easily convey when they are unsure or nervous of as their eyes become clear and their ears move outwards. They do have the tendency to ‘get lost’ in the hunt and forget about anything else that may be going on, and can wander off. They are quick and agile enough to worry rabbits so care must be taken regarding if, and when, they are given off-lead time. Any training given can soon be forgotten when there’s a fresh scent to follow!","The cheerful Basset Fauve is just about the right size to make a great house dog, although his love of the great outdoors should never be underestimated and a romp in the fields should be a regular occurrence. A courageous pack hound will settle into a family and make a marvellous companion. The Basset Fauve is a remarkably speedy character. With their strong nose and a lively sense of independence they will happily tear around for hours ignoring your recall.","This is a small (ish!) solidly built hound. The breed is reminiscent of the Basset Hound but is finer and has longer legs. Some examples have been known go grow as tall as a Labrador, but this is the exception rather than the rule. These are neat little hounds that are typically 'Basset' in appearance i.e. long bodies and short legs! They have very harsh, dense coats. They are very quick off the mark and stride out well. The head should be of medium-length. The eyes should be dark hazel and the ears set on level with the eyes ending in a point and covered with finer, darker and softer hair than that on the body. The jaws should be strong with a complete scissor bite. The neck should be rather short and muscular adjoining slightly sloping shoulders. The chest should be wide and deep with a level top-line. The forelegs can be straight or slightly crooked and strongly boned, whilst, the hind legs are strong. The feet should be tight with firm, hard pads and the tail set on high and carried like a sickle when moving. The Basset Fauve boasts a rough, dense coat that usually needs stripping, but is perfect for keeping the elements out – essential for a hunting animal. The preferred colours for the show ring are red, wheaten or fawn. Some white may occur on the chest or neck, however this is undesirable for show ring purposes.

Less frequent are white patches in the fur; neither black nor white areas are accepted according to breed standards. Whether red or fawn, the colour should always be solid notwithstanding the slightly darker ears.",,"Basset Fauves should have their diets closely monitored as any excess weight can put unnecessary strain on the bones and joints and could cause arthritis as the dog ages. An overweight dog is also more prone to diabetes, a life-limiting disease that is very expensive to treat.

Attention should be paid to their ears as well, keeping them clean and clear. In addition, their coats should be combed through regularly and plucked twice a year. Their coats should never be trimmed, however, the excess hair around their ear passages should be removed.","Following a breed survey carried out in 2004, the UK Kennel Club found the most likely causes of death in the Basset are road traffic accidents, cancer, and heart or kidney failure. It’s a widely held belief that road accidents occur due to the dog’s love of the scent and its tendency to go AWOL.  The few health issues that commonly occur within the breed include reproductive problems, ear infections, corneal ulcers and cataracts.

Having been on the UK Kennel Club rare breeds list for some time, the Basset finally came off in 2007 after gaining popularity as a show animal and as a pet. In addition, the breed retains its popularity amongst hunters. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>\n    A Tawny Brittany Basset Breed History: The Basset Fauve De Bretagne is an excellent bloodhound, originally bred to hunt in packs with French Royalty. Essentially a scent hound, the Basset Fauve De Bretagne is descended from the now-extinct Grand Fauve De Bretagne, a large hunting hound used in the ancient kingdom of Brittany in France. Bred to be a useful hunting dog, the basset is the smallest of the Fauve De Bretagne breed. It’s speculated that Basset numbers were so low in France following World War II; the Fauve De Bretagne had to be rescued by using some of the remaining animals and crossing these with other types (these include ‘The Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen’ as well as the wirehaired Dachshund). The Kennel Club in France, however, maintain that this is not the case and that numbers were never small enough to warrant genetic input from other breeds. Many experts suggest that the Grand Fauve De Bretagne was brought to the UK in the 16th Century to strengthen existing hunting packs in England and Wales. Again, there is little documented evidence to support this. Although hounds that resemble the Grand – particularly in Welsh foxhound packs can still sometimes be seen. Character: Basset Fauves are affectionate, playful little dogs, which make great pets and are very good with children. However, it must be remembered that they are hunting animals and never really lose their love of the chase. In light of this, they may not suit everybody. An interesting characteristic of the breed is that they can easily convey when they are unsure or nervous of as their eyes become clear and their ears move outwards. They do have the tendency to ‘get lost’ in the hunt and forget about anything else that may be going on, and can wander off. They are quick and agile enough to worry rabbits so care must be taken regarding if, and when, they are given off-lead time. Any training given can soon be forgotten when there’s a fresh scent to follow! Temperament: The cheerful Basset Fauve is just about the right size to make a great house dog, although his love of the great outdoors should never be underestimated and a romp in the fields should be a regular occurrence. A courageous pack hound will settle into a family and make a marvellous companion. The Basset Fauve is a remarkably speedy character. With their strong nose and a lively sense of independence they will happily tear around for hours ignoring your recall. Conformation: This is a small (ish!) solidly built hound. The breed is reminiscent of the Basset Hound but is finer and has longer legs. Some examples have been known go grow as tall as a Labrador, but this is the exception rather than the rule. These are neat little hounds that are typically \'Basset\' in appearance i.e. long bodies and short legs! They have very harsh, dense coats. They are very quick off the mark and stride out well. The head should be of medium-length. The eyes should be dark hazel and the ears set on level with the eyes ending in a point and covered with finer, darker and softer hair than that on the body. The jaws should be strong with a complete scissor bite. The neck should be rather short and muscular adjoining slightly sloping shoulders. The chest should be wide and deep with a level top-line. The forelegs can be straight or slightly crooked and strongly boned, whilst, the hind legs are strong. The feet should be tight with firm, hard pads and the tail set on high and carried like a sickle when moving. The Basset Fauve boasts a rough, dense coat that usually needs stripping, but is perfect for keeping the elements out – essential for a hunting animal. The preferred colours for the show ring are red, wheaten or fawn. Some white may occur on the chest or neck, however this is undesirable for show ring purposes. Fur on the ears is usually darker and finer than on the body, the eyes and nose should be dark and the breed standards state they should have no crook in the front legs. The ears should be pleated and reach the nose rather than the floor. Colour: Colours include fawn, wheaten and red. Some puppies arrive with black patches. These patches can fade, as the animal gets older. Less frequent are white patches in the fur; neither black nor white areas are accepted according to breed standards. Whether red or fawn, the colour should always be solid notwithstanding the slightly darker ears. Training: Care: Basset Fauves should have their diets closely monitored as any excess weight can put unnecessary strain on the bones and joints and could cause arthritis as the dog ages. An overweight dog is also more prone to diabetes, a life-limiting disease that is very expensive to treat. However, necessary care should be taken not to over-exercise them in their youth as this can promote serious joint issues in later life.

Basset Hound,Medium: Weight Male 50 – 65 lb (23 – 29kg) Female 45 – 60 lb (20 – 27 kg) Height Male 12 – 15” (30– 38 cm) Female 11 – 14” (28 – 36 cm),"Basset Hounds originated in France and were initially used throughout Europe as hunting dogs. An ancient breed, they are a direct descendant of the Bloodhound and possess a similarly impressive sense of smell. Basset Hounds were first bred by monks who were in need of a slower variety of hunting dog that could be easily followed by foot. The fact that they are slow movers not only makes them more convenient for hunters pursue but also makes them less likely to startle game. While Bassets characteristically have slow reflexes, this is more than compensated for by their excellent sense of smell. These dogs proved to be excellent trackers of rabbit, hare, pheasant and deer and are able to hunt both in packs and alone. Basset Hound’s have long been a popular breed throughout history, with Shakespeare poetically describing their ears “which sweep away the morning dew."" In fact, so distinctive are their droopy features that their name is derived from the French word ""bas"" meaning low. It is even said that George Washington was given Basset Hounds as a gift from Lafayette after the American Revolution. Since 1935, the Basset Hound Club of America has promoted the breed as a resourceful hunter, tracker and companion.","Mild-mannered and obedient, your Basset Hound is a mellow character and will make an excellent member of the family. While they may be more laid back than other breeds they are by no means shy and, being pack dogs by nature, love to feel like they are part of the action. Great all-around playmates, your Basset Hound has a sweet nature that is near irresistible. Despite this they can prove to be difficult to train and housebreak. Rather sneakily, they tend have a selective memory when it comes to commands—especially when there are no treats involved as an incentive. You will find that your Basset Hound is also very vocal when they want something, howling or even grumbling in a low murmuring sound until they get what they want. Your dog’s superior sense of smell is rivalled only by that of the bloodhound and as a result care needs to be taken when walking them. It should be noted that when Basset Hounds pick up a scent, they can get distracted and are very good at escaping from yards and slipping out of their collars. If you do intend to let them off the leash, do so at your own risk as they are more than likely to dart off in chase of some form of prey. Despite their hunting instincts sometimes getting the better of them, Basset Hounds are an extremely lovable dog with a kind nature and will easily blend in to family life.","The Basset Hound has a sweet, gentle nature and will be entirely devoted to their owner. This breed’s laid-back nature means that they will slot easily into family life, whether it’s time to relax or play. Basset hounds are very affectionate and will get on well with adults and children alike, particularly those who cuddle them. This being said their long ears are quite sensitive so take care with young children and ensure that they are respectful of this. The Basset Hound should never behave aggressively, yet it is integral that they know their place and taught to be obedient form an early age. While housebreaking can be difficult at first, they respond well to encouragement and gentle training and are especially well behaved when treats are involved. Basset Hounds are even known to perform tricks for the right kind of reward (they really do love their treats). While they are obedient with proper training, their hunting instincts are powerful and will kick into action without notice. For this reason it is recommended that you only allow them off the lead in safe areas. The Basset Hound has a very loving nature. While they may make a good alarm dog due to their howling and barking, they are far too gentle to be successful guard dogs.","Basset Hounds are short, long, sturdy dogs with the thick frames necessary to trail animals over any terrain. Their medium-sized heads have rounded skulls, long and deep muzzles, and black noses. They have dark, slightly sunken eyes that have a soft sad expression, and their ears are long, low and silky. The skin hangs loosely and falls in folds on the head. Basset Hounds have deep chests, narrow shoulders and thick, sturdy legs. The deep chest should extend over the front legs. Their backs should be long and straight and their tapered tails are carried high. They have short, dense, weather-resistant coats that should be straight and firm in texture.","The Basset Hound comes in a range of colours, but is typically white with deep brown markings.","The Basset Hound can be a very sensitive breed, so it is necessary that training is both gentle and patient. It is important to maintain a level of consistency and if all else fails; treats always make a great incentive","The smooth, shorthaired coat of the Basset Hound is simple to groom. In order to reduce shedding, the coat needs to be combed and brushed with a firm bristle brush and shampooed only when necessary. Earls need to be cleaned regularly while trim toenails also need to be trimmed","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, if your Beagle does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. Common diseases include epilespsy, glaucoma and thrombopathy. Hip and elbow dysplasia can also occur, and it is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. Other problems can include patella luxation, where the kneecap slips in and out of place. It is very important not to overfeed your Basset Hound, as extra weight places far too great of a load on their legs and spine. They are also prone to bloating, so it is best to feed them three small meals a day rather than one large one. However, if you are careful who you buy from, your Basset Hound should give you many years of good health, fun and loving companionship.","('Hound',)",Singles City-dwellers Families Active people,Affectionate Mellow Active

The breed was originally developed in the late 19th century in the mountains of Bavaria, Germany. The breed was developed by selectively crossbreeding the Hanovarian  Hound with Red Mountain Hounds in order to create a tracking hound with a lighter, more agile frame to be able to navigate mountainous terrain with greater ease. The ""Klub für Bayrische Gebirgsschweißhunde"", (Club for Bavarian Mountain hound) was founding in Munich in 1912 and afterwards the breed began to gain popularity in both Austria and Hungary.","This is a well balanced, calm breed. They are extremely loyal to their family and master but can be aloof with strangers. They are cool and self-assured but very docile, being neither timid nor aggressive. They make good family companions provided they are given plenty of exercise and mental stimulation but are generally quiet around the house. They can be very affectionate to their family and loyal but can be easily distracted by interesting scents. This breed likes to be part of the family and develops a deep bond with their family, liking to be included in all activities. This breed is well behaved with children providing he has been brought up with them but can be reserved with strangers. They are independent and free-spirited, requiring a firm but patient owner.","This breed is calm, well balanced, quiet and extremely loyal to their master and family. They are athletic and poised and when hunting, are very focused and determined. Bred for their hunting abilities, they are very agile and fast, able to easily navigate mountainous terrain and have a very strong hunting instinct but require an experienced and patient trainer.","This breed is athletic and well proportioned and muscular. The head is strong and elongated and the skull is broad and slightly domed with a pronounced stop. The muzzle should be broad with a black or dark red nose with wide nostrils. The ears are set high and hang heavily against the head with rounded tips. The body is rectangular and slightly raised at the rump. The neck is strong and medium in length and the topline is sloping slightly upwards from the withers to the hindquarters. The chest is well developed and moderately wide and the tail is high set and medium in length, carried level to the ground or hanging down. The Bavarians coat is short, thick and shiny. The coat lies flat against the body and is fairly coarse. It is finer on the head and ears, growing longer on the legs, tail and body.","The coat comes in all shades of black-masked fawn or brindle, solid deep red, deer red, reddish brown, tan and reddish grey.","The Bavarian Mountain Hound is intelligent and eager to learn and are very responsive to firm, patient and respectful trainers. Early socialisation and obedience training is recommended and training should be based on positive reinforcement and praise. They do not respond well to harsh or heavy handling. When sufficiently socialised and trained, this breed is well behaved and docile but they can be independent and strong will so require a firm but patient hand.",This breed is not well suited to city life and needs regular exercise and plenty of space. The coat requires regular grooming but they are not heavy shedders.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 14 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed suffers from relatively few health issues but should be hip tested as Hip Displasia can be present in this breed. It should also be noted that this breed can very rarely suffer from Entropian. Exercise: This breed requires a considerable amount of exercise but due to its hunting instincts, it is not recommended to allow this breed to roam off the lead due to their tendency to follow trails. They do best in the country where they can get plenty of exercise and require a large and securely fenced back yard. This breed needs a lot of physical and mental stimulation to keep it fit and healthy due to their working nature.","('Crossbreeds are not recognised by the KC',)","Active, outdoorsy types Experienced dog handlers Foresters Game Wardens",Elegant Athletic Calm Well balanced

It is believed that the breed originated as a cross between the Harrier and other types of English hounds. The Beagle can hunt alone or in packs and, being a scent hound, has the tendency to follow his nose and ignore all else. The exact origin of the Beagle name isn’t entirely clear, but may have come from the French term ""be’geule,"" which translates to “gape throat,” in reference to their baying voice. It is also possible that the name may refer to the dog's size, stemming from the French word “beigh”, the Old English word “begele”, or the Celtic word “beag”, which all mean ""small"". The breed standard was declared in the 1860s and in 1888 the National Beagle Club was formed to hold agility and obedience contests. To this day Beagles make celebrated hunters, sporting dogs and narcotics detection dogs as well as excellent family pets.","Your Beagle is a happy type, as is clear by that ever-wagging tail. They need ample attention and affection and love to feel as though they are an active member of the family. Children will adore them, as they make energetic but gentle playmates and are always ready to get up to mischief. Beagles are sweet and gentle and will happily welcome you home after a long days work. They are extremely adaptable to different environments and lifestyles and are equally as good with children as adults. Unfortunately their hunting genes mean that they are not to be trusted around non-canine pets unless they are socialised with them at a young age. Your beagle is absolutely bursting with energy. It is important that they are kept active and two lengthy walks a day should do the trick to tire your little companion out. Beagles do have a mind of their own and can be very stubborn. Consistent training is necessary to let them know who is in charge and ensure that they do not loose their focus. Beagles are happy individuals that make fantastic family companions.","Beagles have an extremely sweet nature and love to socialise.  Being so energetic, they are well suited to family life and make fantastic playmates for young children. Lively and active, they are enthusiastic walkers and are always curious of new surroundings. It should be noted that when Beagles pick up a scent they are prone to wander off and are best kept close and on a tight leash unless they are in a safe area. One of the Beagle’s most endearing qualities is their constant murmuring. While their braying can sometimes grow tiresome, it often feels as if your small companion is attempting to talk to you. Protective of their environments without being aggressive towards strangers, Beagles will bark if a suspicious person approaches the house, making them an excellent guard dog. Ever alert, their even temperament ensures that they are very rarely aggressive. While Beagles can be mischievous at times, their affable nature makes for a wonderful companion","Beagles are solid, hardy little dogs. They should possess small, rounded skulls with a square muzzle and wide nostrils. Their large brown eyes are set wide apart and their low hanging ears are wide and long. Their tails should be raised and carried with pride, never curled over the back of the body. The body should be stout and squarely built and the feet are round and firm. The Beagle’s close sleek coat is simple to care for thanks to its medium length. The hair should lie close to the body of the dog and should be hard, never soft or silky.","Beagles are widely known for their tricolour coats and come in a range of colour combinations including black and tan, red and white and orange and white.","While they are highly intelligent, Beagles can prove to be stubborn and tough to train. They tend to lose interest quickly and as a result require firm and patient training to ensure obedience. Beagles respond well to compliments and receiving treats and ultimately love to please their owners",The Beagle's smooth shorthaired coat needs to be brushed daily with a firm bristle brush and bathed with mild soap only when necessary. The ears need to be cleaned regularly as the breed in prone to painful infections. The nails should also be trimmed,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 15 years, which is normal for a dog of this size.

Bearded Collie,Medium: Weight Male 40 – 60 lb (18 – 27 kg) Female 40 – 55 lb (27 – 23 kg) Height Male 21 – 22” (53 – 56 cm) Female 20 – 21” (51– 53 cm),"The Bearded Collie is one of Britain's oldest breeds. It is said that the Bearded Collie’s origins can be traced back to 1514, when a Polish sea caption traded three of his Polish Sheepdogs with a Scottish shepherd in return for a lamb and an ewe. The shepherd then bred the Polish dogs with local herding and flock dogs such as the Old English Sheepdog. They were developed to become independent workers that were capable of making decisions concerning their charges without the need for human guidance. Used as herding dogs for centuries in Scotland, this hardy breed became known alternatively as the Highland Collie, the Highland Sheepdog and the Hairy Moved Collie. Now definitively known as the Bearded Collie, the name is inspired by long bread-like hairs which grow on dog’s chin, while “Collie"" is the Scottish word for herding dog. The Bearded Collie came close to extinction during the Second World War. They were saved in 1944 by Mrs. G. O. Willison from Great Britain, who bred a pair of Bearded Collies and encouraged a dedicated program to continue doing so. They are still to this day considered a rare breed. In 1967 the first litter of Bearded Collies was whelped in the USA, with the breed being officially recognised by the AKC in 1976. Displaying an array of talents, such as tracking, herding, competitive obedience and performing tricks, the Bearded Collie makes for a beloved and versatile pet.","Your Bearded Collie has a cheerful air, signified by their perpetually wagging tail.

Their affectionate, playful nature makes them the perfect companion for children and they just love to feel as though they are a part of the family. The Bearded Collie has boundless levels of energy and will make a very willing jogging companion. While generally good-natured, they do tend to get restless and, at worst, destructive when they haven’t had a sufficient amount of exercise. As long as their physical requirements are taken into account, Bearded Collies will remain sweet and playful. A confident dog, the Bearded Collie will never resort to aggression and are rarely shy. While Bearded Collies are generally sweet and gentle, they can also be quite stubborn and rowdy at times. It is integral that owners display a natural authority and are firm, confident and consistent when dealing with this dog. The Bearded Collie is an exuberant and bright breed that is equally suited for being a household pet as well as working in any weather condition on any terrain.","The Bearded Collie is a medium-sized, sturdy working dog. The body should be long and lean, while the head should large, broad and flat. Their wide, flat heads are draped in long hair and feature strong muzzles and long, hanging ears. The Bearded Collie’s large round eyes have a warm expression that reveals their affable nature. Rather unusually, their eyes are in tone with their coat colour and vary between black, blue, brown and fawn accordingly.

They require an owner who will provides them with consistent training and expose them to new people and situations.","The Bearded Collie’s long, shaggy coat must be coated lightly with water and brushed daily. Brushing should prevent tangles and matting that can prove to be tricky to tame if not attended to regularly, especially when the dog is shedding. Dry shampooing and bathing should be done when necessary and eyes, ears and paws should be checked daily. It is also important to check Border Collies regularly for ticks, as they are difficult to locate in the thick undercoat.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 14 and 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, if your Bearded Collie does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. While Bearded Collies are generally a healthy breed, possible diseases include epilepsy, colonic disease and Addison’s disease. Hip and elbow dysplasia can also occur, and it is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. The thick coat of a Bearded Collie may conceal an external parasite infestation so it is integral that they are checked regularly. However, if you are careful who you buy from, your Bearded Collie should give you many years of good health, fun and loving companionship.","('Herding',)",Active Singles Families with older children Outdoorsy types People who like long walks,Outgoing Hardy Energetic Playful Stubborn

Appearing in Renaissance manuscripts as far back as 1578, this breed has spent centuries herding sheep and cattle on European farms. In 1863 Frenchman Pierre Megnin differentiated between the two types of French sheepdogs, the long-coated Briard and the short-coated Beauceron. In the same year the Beauceron was shown in the first Canine Exposition in Paris. Selective breeding softened the nature of the Beauceron, who had previously been known to snap and bite in defence of its flock. Like many sheep herding breeds, the Beauceron is easy to train for tasks beyond their usual roles. Their calm nature and ability to follow commands without hesitation was revealed in both World War One and World War Two when they were used as messengers for the French army. They were prized for their ability to detect mines, pursue trails and follow directions as well as the bravery that they displayed. Beaucerons were charged with finding the wounded and carrying food and provisions to the front line, despite the threat of exploding bombs or artillery fire. Today, the Beauceron continues to be used by the military and police as well as maintaining its traditional role as herder. This stoic breed also makes a devoted family pet","Your Beauceron is a powerful breed that is known for its fierce sense of loyalty. Their bravery and dedication to their owners makes them a worthy, natural guard dog. Your companion is very active by nature and thrives on physical and mental stimulation. They enjoy free play in safe areas and lengthy walks. If Beaucerons get bored it is likely that they will become destructive, so it is best to ensure that they receive the exercise and attention that they need. Due to their loyalty and devotion to the family, this breed does not do well as an outside pet. The Beauceron will be fine in an apartment provided that they are stimulated, although a large fenced yard is preferable. They are a working breed will be happiest with some form of job to do and it is integral that they are both physically and mentally stimulated. The Beauceron needs variety. Another one of their many talents is working as a herding dog. Their natural instincts mean that may attempt to herd humans and they need to be taught from an early age that this is not acceptable. Training and adequate exercise are important in ensuring that you Beauceron remains calm and obedient. They are not recommended for homes with small children due to their herding instinct but are able to get on with other pets if well socialised. If give it the care and attention that it needs, your Beauceron will make for a devoted and loving companion.","The Beauceron is a very intelligent dog and is quick to learn and adapt to new situations. They are a working dog by nature and display a high level of bravery and obedience when under pressure. These qualities make for an extremely loyal companion and the Beauceron will always remain devoted to their owner, provided that they are treated with the respect and care that they deserve. Eager and willing to please, they excel at obedience training and are very quick to understand and respond to commands. That being said, the Beauceron is a very strong-willed and stubborn dog. For this reason it is integral that the owner asserts their dominance from the outset and ensures that the dog knows their rightful place. Beaucerons need to be socialised with children and other pets from a young age , so that they remain calm and capable of interaction. The Beauceron is an extremely capable breed that is just as comfortable with police work as it is being the beloved family companion.","The Beauceron is an athletic working dog that should have a large, muscular frame covered in a short, dense coat. It features a long-muzzled head with clean-cut features and ears that point straight up. The dark brown eyes are horizontal and slightly oval while the ears are set high and either cropped or left natural. The tail should be fringed and carried low, reaching at least to the hock. The Beauceron has a naturally weather resistant double coat, with longer hair on both the tail and hindquarters. The outer coat is harsh and straight, while the undercoat is soft and woolly in texture. The colouring of Beaucerons is quite specific and they should either be black with distinct tan markings or possess a harlequin coat with patches of grey, black and tan. The harlequin coats should have more black than grey and not feature any white markings. The black and tan dogs should have tan markings in two dots above the eyes, on the sides of the muzzle, the cheeks, the throat, under the tail and on the legs and the chest. Tan markings on the chest should appear as two spots but a chest plate is acceptable.","The Beauceron is either black and tan with specific tan markings or harlequin with patches of grey, black and tan",The Beauceron requires obedience and socialisation from an early age. It is integral that the dog knows their role within the family and is dealt with firmly but fairly. Training must be done with consistency and a dominant role maintained by the owner in order to prevent the Beauceron from attempting assuming a dominant position.,"Grooming the Beauceron is a very simple process. Brushing must be carried out at least twice a week (more during times of shedding) and bathing needs to be done only when necessary. During autumn and spring shedding seasons, the brushing schedule should be increased to keep up with the excess amount of fur.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years. The Beauceron has relatively few genetic health issues and if you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, if your Beauceron does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. While Beaucerons are generally a healthy breed, possible concerns gastric torsion and coronary heat disease. Hip and elbow dysplasia can also occur, and it is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. Some lines are prone to bloating, so it is important to carefully regulate their food intake and ensure that they get a sufficient amount of exercise.

Bedlington Terrier,Small: Weight: Male 18 - 23 lb (8 - 10kg) Female 18 - 23 lb (8 - 10kg),"Originating in the 1800s from the county of Northumberland in North Eastern England, the Bedlington Terrier was originally bred to hunt rats in the mines which were prevalent in the region. The Bedlington Terrier’s original name was the Rothbury Terrier after the northern town of Rothbury. It wasn’t until around 1825 that the breed was renamed after the Bedlington mining Shire. As well as hunting vermin down the mines, Bedlington Terriers were also used to hunt foxes, hares and badgers and hunters used them as retrievers. The original Bedlington breed was later crossed with the whippet in order to create a more agile, faster breed. It has also been suggested that the Otterhound and Dandie Dinmont Terrier have contributed to the breed.","Confident, spirited, bold and sporty – your Bedlington Terrier is a big dog in a small body. He’s bred to hunt and sometimes it might feel like he isn’t afraid of anyone or anything. Your Bedlington Terrier thinks he can show a Rottweiler who’s boss, despite their difference in size! They’re never shy or nervous and will run the household if you let them. Small Dog Syndrome can be an issue with Bedlington Terriers so they need an owner who will be a firm and consistent pack leader with an air of authority in order to keep them in check. Bedlington Terriers have buckets of energy, which can make them high strung if they don’t get plenty of exercise. If they are both physically and mentally stimulated, your Bedlington will be a well-balanced, mild and gentle dog with plenty of affection to bestow upon you","The Bedlington has typical terrier traits; he’s a scrappy fighter, has a high prey drive, loves to dig, and can bark and bark seemingly without end. However, they are considered to be the softer of the terrier types. The Bedlington Terrier is warm and affectionate with a hugely loving personality. Even though they are usually fairly friendly with strangers, they are watchful dogs which are incredibly protective of their family and will always alert them to danger and approaching visitors. The Bedlington Terrier will get along with dogs and other animals providing they have been raised together, however they don’t tolerate dominating behaviour well and can react aggressively if threatened.","The Bedlington Terrier is a very distinctive looking dog with a lamb-like appearance. It has a pear shaped, narrow head with small almond shaped eyes. The muzzle is strong with no stop and the jaw is long and meets in a level or scissor bite. The ears are triangular and hanging, with tassels of hair on the ends. A muscular body holds a long neck, deep chest and a long, tapered tail, while the back is arched. The Bedlington Terrier’s double coat is thick, curly and contains both hard and soft hair.","The Bedlington Terrier’s thick coat comes in blue, sandy or liver shades. There may also be tan coloured markings over the eyes and on the chest, legs and rear. Bedlington puppies are born dark, but lighten to their adult shade within one year.","The Bedlington Terrier is generally not an easy dog to train and needs a great deal of patience and guidance from its master. They can be independent and skittish and they can be easily distracted, so getting your Bedlington Terrier to focus on training can be a challenge. However, the breed thrives on human companionship and wants to please you, so stick to your training methods. Be firm, positive and rewarding and with time you’ll have a well-trained terrier that can excel in agility and obedience. They do not respond well to harsh training. Start training from a very young age in order to avoid excessive and obsessive barking and be sure to socialise them with people and other animals as soon as possible.","The Bedlington Terrier is a high maintenance breed when it comes to grooming, due to the nature of his coat. The Bedlington coat sheds very little hair, but needs specialised clipping every six weeks from a knowledgeable professional. The coat should be thinned and clipped close to the head and body to accentuate the Bedlington Terrier’s shape. The ears should be shaved. Your Bedlington Terrier will also need to be brushed on a regular basis, however bathing should be kept to a minimum as it can damage the texture of the coat. As the Bedlington Terrier sheds very little it is considered a good breed option for allergy sufferers.","The Bedlington terrier is prone to an inherited liver problem called Copper Storage Disease, which is very serious. The breed is also susceptible to hereditary kidney disease, PRA, thyroid problems and eye problems, such as cataracts and retinal disease.

While all four Belgian Shepherd breeds are anatomically the same, the coats are different and the Groenendael has a beautiful long, black coat. In the 1890’s a Professor of the Belgian School of Veterinary Sciences noted the similarities in the varieties of Belgian shepherding dogs and the differences between their coats and then divided them into four varieties, advising that they should be bred separately. However, it wasn’t until 1910 that the name Groenendael was chosen for the breed. The Groenendael shares the same name as the city it originates from, where the breed was developed after a black female Belgian sheepdog being was crossed with another black herding dog. The resulting fluffy, black coated litter set the precedent for the lovable Groenendael breed. Proving their loyalty, obedience and willingness to protect its owners, Belgian Groenendaels were used during World War I to find wounded soldiers and deliver messages at the front line. As a result, their breeding schedule suffered, but this act of canine bravery may have contributed to their popularity in the long term.","Your Belgian Groenendael is an active character who likes nothing better than keeping busy – he loves to have a job to do! Belgian Groenendaels were bred as herding dogs and would be in charge of looking over large flocks of sheep, so it’s in their genes to protect and guard. Your Groenendael is therefore naturally alert and attentive, as well as loyal and obedient. This not only makes your Groenendael an excellent guard and watch dog but also a wonderful companion, who will always take care of his human family. Your Groenendael is patient and playful with children, providing he is socialised with them when he’s still a young pup. However, your Groenendael also has an inbred herding skill which creates a natural tendency to want to herd people, other animals and children. If they aren’t trained that this behaviour is unwanted they might nip at heels, chase or circle you. In order to prevent this behaviour, you must train and socialise your Belgian Tervueren from an early age.","Looking for a highly intelligent breed which loves to be challenged? The Belgian Groenendael could well be for you. Groenendaels need a lot of mental stimulation as they are incredibly smart and are happier with work to do than they are relaxing all day. Expect to provide your Groenendael with plenty of games and fun training in order to keep him happy, as well as long daily walks to burn up some of his abundant energy. Your Groenendael is a family dog through and through – he’ll want to join in with everything you do and go everywhere you go, so make sure he’s integrated with your family life. If he doesn’t get plenty of attention your Groenendael may become destructive. Groenendaels are incredibly affectionate towards their owners and are highly protective of them. A calm, dependable watchdog, your Groenendael always has your safety in mind and will happily guard your home. This protective streak can mean that they are wary of strangers, so socialise them well from an early age in order to avoid over protectiveness, shyness or even aggression.","A medium sized, long haired dog, the Belgian Groenendael has a squarely shaped body and long, straight legs with cat like feet. The gait is light, elegant and graceful. The feathered tail is strong at the base and low hanging. From a side profile, the top line of the Groenendael’s moderately pointed muzzle should be parallel to the top line of the skull, and both the muzzle and skull should be approximately the same length. An even or scissor bite, medium sized dark brown eyes and small, triangular ears, should all be prevalent and create an alert expression. The nose should be black, as should the lips which are tight. The coat is weather resistant and moderately long, with an extra mane of fur around the neck and feathering on the legs, tail and chest.","The Belgian Groenendael’s coat colour is black. The coat may be a solid black all over the body or could have a small amount of white on the chest, chin or toes.","Your Groenendael is intelligent, which means that they can pick up training easily when it is done well by the owner. As he’s so smart, training should be kept fun and interesting or your Groenendael may become bored and disinterested. Consistent, firm, reward based training is the best way to teach your Groenendael. Never encourage your Groenendael’s guarding behaviour as it can lead to overprotectiveness and guarding in inappropriate situations.","Due to the length of your Groenendael’s double coat, the breed can be a little high maintenance when it comes to grooming. Daily brushing is necessary to prevent clumps and knots from forming, and during shedding season you might even need to brush your Groenendael more than once per day. Heavy shedding occurs twice a year, with light shedding continuing all year long. Matted areas should be gently clipped out if they can’t be brushed through – these tend to form in the ruff around the neck and on the legs. The hair should also be clipped between the toes and on the outer ears","The Belgian Groenendael is a relatively healthy breed with no major health problems, however some minor issues can occur. Epilepsy, skin allergies, eye problems, excessive shyness, excessive aggressiveness and sometimes dysplasia and elbow dysplasia have been seen in the breed. Groenendaels also have a tendency to become obese, which shortens their lives and can lead to illness, so make sure they are well exercised and not overfed.

Their wiry, waterproof coats made the Laekenois the perfect breed ideal for outdoor work, no matter what the weather may be.  The Laekenois is one of four breeds of Belgian Shepherd, which are all considered essentially same, with the only real difference being the coat types. The breeds are so similar that they were considered as one breed until the 1890s, when a Professor of the Belgian School of Veterinary Sciences recorded the differences between the four sheepdog types and set breed standards for them, suggesting that they be bred separately and not mixed. However, many countries still recognise the Belgian sheepdogs as one breed, and the Laekenois is the only Belgian Shepherd not to be recognised at all by the AKC in the United States of America. The Laekenois excels at agility, tracking and chasing which means that the breed is more often used for work than as a family pet. While they may not be used for herding sheep and keeping watch over linens any more, their alertness, attentiveness and protectiveness are put to good use by the Belgian army and police","Loyal and protective, your Belgian Laekenois lives to serve you! Laekenois love human company and thrive on being around their owner, but tend to only bond with one member of the family. Your Laekenois wants you to be safe and secure and they will not only be sure to protect you, they’ll also keep watch over your family and home. However, don’t think that your Laekenois will be happy as a kennel dog that lives outside with the sole purpose of keeping an eye out for intruders. Companionship is very important to the breed and they should be made to feel as though they are part of the family. Laekenois are wonderfully energetic dogs and suit owners with active lifestyles who can give them plenty of exercise. Herding is in the Laekenois’ genetic makeup and they can show herding behaviour towards people. This includes circling, chasing or nipping at heels, so it’s important to train them not do this early on in their lives","The Belgian Laekenois’ protective nature means they tend to be wary of strangers, so don’t expect them to greet guests with a cheerful welcome. They’ll keep a watchful eye over any visitors. Your Laekenois is energetic and highly intelligent, so he needs to be both mentally and physically stimulated in order to keep him happy and content. Give him lots of attention and exercise, or he’ll find his own amusement through destructive behaviour. Though Laekenois will get on well with children they have been raised around, rough play, tug of war and chasing games should not be indulged in as it encourages herding behaviour. The breed can show dominance over other dogs, but generally gets on well with canines it has grown up with, however it is not usually a good idea to have a Laekenois and non-canine pet in the same household. As the Belgian Laekenois breed can be prone to shyness or aggressiveness, it is vital that your Laekenois is socialised with other people and animals from an early age.","The Belgian Shepherd Laekenois is a medium sized dog with a square shaped, muscular body and long straight legs with cat-like feet. The Laekenois has a deep chest and the tail is thick at the base and reaches to the hock. The muzzle should be slightly pointed and both the muzzle and skull should be approximately the same length. The medium, almond shaped eyes should be dark brown and the ears erect, triangular and highly set. The nose and tight lips are black. The Laekenois most distinctive feature is his coat, which sets him apart from the three other Belgian Shepherd breeds. Wiry and shaggy, the short to medium length coat has a rough appearance and has a waterproof coating.  The woolly look of his coat is further added to be the fringing around his head and muzzle, and his dense, bushy tail.","Your Belgian Laekenois could be a fawn or mahogany colour, with a black overlap and black shading on his muzzle and tail.","The Belgian Shepherd Laekenois is a breed which is prone to dominance and therefore needs training and socialisation from as early an age as possible to prevent aggressive or shy behaviour. It is important that you are confident and firm with your Laekenois so he knows that you are in charge and have authority over him. For this reason, Laekenois are best suited to an experienced dog owner who can handle their stubborn streak and will be consistent in their training methods. Your Laekenois will flat out refuse to partake in training if you are overbearing, impatient or too harsh, so be firm but fair and reward good behaviour instead of scolding the wrong behaviour. Laekenois react well to positive reinforcement.","The Belgian Laekenois has an unusual wiry coat, which needs a small amount of special care. The Laekenois’ coat should be trimmed twice a year, but never closely clipped as this will ruin the coat for several years. A daily comb or brush will prevent the scruffy, rough-looking coat from becoming too tangled and prevent matting. Bathing should only take place when absolutely necessary as it can damage the coat’s waterproof coating. When possible, consider spot cleaning your Belgian Laekenois if he gets dirty instead of bathing him, as it’s much better for his coat.","The Belgian Laekenois’ average lifespan is 12-14 years. The Laekenois is a hardy and resilient breed with no major health concerns. There are, however a few small health issues to be aware of when you have a Laekenois. Skin allergies, eye problems, excessive shyness, excessive aggressiveness and hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia have all been noted within the breed, as well as sensitivity to anaesthesia. Epilepsy can occur in the breed, but it is not common due to careful breeders who have bred this genetic issue out.

While the four Belgian shepherd breeds are anatomically the same, they all have different types of coat which set them apart from each other. The Malinois has a short coat which can be red, fawn or grey. Due to their similarity, Belgian sheepdogs used to be classed as the same breed and were interbred. However, in the 1890s a professor of the Belgian School of Veterinary Sciences recorded standards for the various types of Belgian sheepdogs and advised that they should be bred separately. Following this, the Malinois was the first of the Belgian sheepdogs to establish a type. Malinois are the workaholics of the dog world – they love to have a job to do! They were bred to herd and watch over flocks of sheep, but in the modern world they are commonly seen working as police and guard dogs. They excel at police work due to their high intelligence, obedience and agility skill and work in narcotics, protection, search and rescue and even bomb detection.","Your Belgian Malinois is incredibly smart and, with the right owner, a wonderfully obedient dog. Originally bred as shepherding dogs, Malinois have a strong instinct to protect and are always alert and watchful of their surroundings. This makes them wonderful guard dogs and they are often seen working as police dogs in Belgium. However, their loyal nature also makes them fantastic family pets, particularly for families who are looking for a dog which will provide some security. Even as a pet, your Malinois will still want to be active and challenged; keep your Malinois mentally as well as physically stimulated or they can become destructive as a way of entertaining themselves. Plenty of daily exercise, training and good company will prevent this unwanted behaviour. As a natural herding dog, your Malinois may show behaviour such as circling, chasing or nipping at heels. This is an instinctive trait which has been bred into them in order to make them excellent as herding sheep and it’s important to train them not do this to people from a young age","If you are looking for a happy go lucky pup that will make friends with everyone and their neighbour, the Malinois isn’t going to be a good fit for you. Your Malinois loves you dearly, but he doesn’t have much time for anyone else. He’ll usually only bond with one member of the family and will be wary of strangers – including any visitors you may have. The Belgian Shepherd Malinois excels at hard work and is loyal, attentive, alert and protective. They can make wonderful pets, but they need a confident and experienced owner to handle them and bring out the best in them. Don’t panic if your Malinois seems to have forgotten all his training at around nine months old – the breed enters a delinquent stage at this time and will be testing your boundaries. Just be patient and start from the beginning. Never encourage aggressive behaviour in your Malinois through rough play, tug of war or chasing, and be sure not to encourage guarding behaviour as it can lead to over protectiveness. Your Malinois will be happiest with an owner who can show him who is boss and has an air of authority at all times, as Malinois can show dominance over timid owners. Due to their tendency to show dominance, Malinois are not recommended for households with non-canine pets, though they will usually get on well with other dogs providing they have been raised with them.","A medium to large sized dog, the Malinois has a square shaped, muscular body with a deep chest and strong tail. Long, straight legs lead to cat-like feet.  The Malinois’ muzzle should be slightly pointed and both the muzzle and skull should be approximately the same length. The length and width of the skull should measure the same distance. The medium, almond shaped eyes should be brown and the ears erect and triangular. The nose and tight lips, which cover a scissor bite, are black. Malinois are blessed with a weather resistant double coat which is short and straight except for around the neck where it is slightly longer.","The Malinois’ coat comes in anything from fawn to mahogany or even black, with black tips on the hairs. The mask and ears should be black, while the chest, tail and back end are a paler fawn shade","Training your Malinois from an early age is vital and intense socialisation should be introduced from birth in order to prevent shyness or even aggressiveness. As Belgian Malinois can show dominance, they need a master to be thorough, consistent and firm in their training, whilst showing respect and never being harsh. Heavy handed training techniques will make your Malinois uncooperative, so always use reward based training and positive reinforcement and remember to be patient.","The Belgian Malinois sheds lightly all year long, and also sheds heavily twice a year, which makes regular brushing an absolute must. Be prepared to find the time to give your Malinois a good brush a few times each week in order to prevent mattes forming in his double coat. Despite the need for regular brushing, the Malinois is not high maintenance when it comes to grooming. Their coat doesn’t need clipping and they should only be bathed when absolutely necessary. The Malinois coat repels a lot of dirt due to its waterproof coating, which frequent bathing can actually damage.","A resilient and hardy breed, the Belgian Malinois has no major health concerns and the average Malinois will live for 12-14 years.

Belgian Shepherd Tervueren,Medium: Weight Male 65 – 75 lb (29 – 34 kg) Female 60 – 70 lb (27 – 32 kg) Height Male 24 – 26” (61-66 cm) Female 22 – 24” (56 – 61 cm,"Originating in 19th century Belgium, the Belgian Tervueren was bred to be a herding dog. It is one of four varieties of Belgian sheepdog and while the Tervueren is anatomically the same to its Belgian sheepdog cousins, it has its own type of coat which is long haired and comes in fawn, red or grey. Though Belgian sheepdogs are thought to have been around since the Middle Ages, it wasn’t until the 1890s when a professor of the Belgian School of Veterinary Sciences recorded breed standards for the various types of Belgian sheepdogs, including the Tervueren. Since then, the Tervueren has been bred as a breed in its own right. Originally a working dog, the Belgian Tervueren has since been bred to include a graceful and elegant gait in addition to its original attributes, making them more suitable for the show ring though they still make wonderful working dogs.","The Belgian Tervueren makes an excellent working dog as an aptitude for hard work has been bred into them. As natural herding dogs, they have a strong instinct to protect and herd, which makes them well suited to becoming police and guard dogs. Their natural drive to protect people and their watchful, attentive and loyal demeanour also makes Tervueren’s great family pets for people who want a dog that can make them feel safe and secure. However, their inbred herding skill creates a natural tendency to want to herd people, other animals and children and if they aren’t trained not to do so they might nip at heels, chase or circle you. In order to prevent this behaviour, you must train and socialise your Belgian Tervueren from a young age.","Your Belgian Tervueren is hopelessly devoted to you! The Tervueren breed is deeply loyal to its owners and usually forms attachments to just one or two of its human family. He thrives on the company of humans; don’t leave this dog outside on his own if you want a happy pooch, he should be made to feel like a part of the family and be included in all your activities. If your Tervueren doesn’t get enough attention and affection then watch out – he’s likely to become destructive as a way of entertaining himself and getting some attention. For Tervuerens even negative attention is better than none at all. Your Tervueren may have a tendency to shyness, so socialise him well with other dogs in order to avoid this. They may show dominance over other dogs and they need careful supervision when introduced to other animals.  At around nine months old the Tervueren enters a juvenile delinquent stage where they seem to want to act out, much like a moody teenager! It may seem as though your Belgian Tervueren has forgotten his training, but be patient and start from the beginning. For this reason, Tervuerens are best suited to experienced dog owners.","A medium sized, long haired dog, the Tervueren has a squarely shaped body and long, straight legs with cat like feet. From a side profile, the top line of the Tervueren’s moderately pointed muzzle should be parallel to the top line of the skull, and both the muzzle and skull should be approximately the same length. A scissor bite, medium sized dark brown eyes and small, triangular ears which are highly set, should all be prevalent. The nose should be black, as should the lips which are tight. The long haired, double coat is weather resistant thanks to dense, closely fitting hairs, while the hair on the head, legs and ears is shorter than elsewhere on the body and the tail is abundant in extra hair. Males can be spotted by their extra mane of fur around the neck.","Your Belgian Tervueren might have a coat in fawn, mahogany or a tone of grey with black tips. He may even have hints of white on his chest, toes and chin. As Tervueren’s age, their coat may change and become darker.","It is very important to train your Tervueren from an early age in order to prevent them trying to herd people and children as they grow up. They should also be socialised with other people and dogs as soon as possible, otherwise shyness or aggressiveness can set in. Never encourage your Tervueren’s guarding behaviour as it can lead to overprotectiveness and guarding in inappropriate situations; let it come naturally and their instinct will dictate when to protect you from danger. Use positive reinforcement to train your Tervueren, as harsh or heavy handed methods will render him uncooperative. Always treat your Tervueren with fairness, respect and firmness in order to get the best out of his training.","If you are looking for a dog which needs very little grooming… keep looking! The Tervueren isn’t for you. Thanks to its long, dense coat which has a thick undercoat and heavy outer coat, daily brushing is an absolute necessity for your Tervueren. You’ll also need to pay attention to any matted clumps on the ears, legs and between the toes as they’ll need to be clipped out. A monthly bath is also a good idea to keep your Tervueren clean and odour free. Light shedding takes place all year around for the Tervueren and heavy shedding takes place once per year for males and twice for females when they blow their undercoat. You need to be prepared to make friends with the vacuum cleaner!","Tervuerens are generally considered to be healthy dogs with no major health concerns, however, they are prone to some minor health worries. Skin allergies, eye problems, excessive shyness or aggressiveness and the occasional occurrence of hip and elbow dysplasia have all been seen within the breed. Epilepsy was a concern for the Belgian Tervueren breed, however thanks to good breeding this is now much less common than it used to be. Tervuerens should be kept on a low fat diet as some breeders have noted thyroid and pancreatic problems, as well as a tendency to become obese when overfed and not exercised enough. Make sure you give your Belgian Tervueren plenty of daily exercise to avoid excessive weight gain.","('Pastoral',)",Couples Families with older children People who like long walks People who want their dog to be part of the family Experienced dog owners,Active and full of energy Excellent guard and watch dog Can be destructive when bored Intelligent Loyal
Bergamasco,Large: Weight Male 70 – 84 lb (32 – 38 kg) Female 57 – 71 lb (26 – 32 kg) Height Male 23.5 – 24.5” (60 – 62cm) Female: 22” – 23” (56 – 58 cm),"The Bergamasco is an ancient shepherding and cattle dog which originates from Persia. Developed to be independent and intelligent, Bergamascos were owned solely for their work aptitude and shepherds kept this breed secret for a long time in order to keep the breed pure. Bergamascos migrated from the Orient to the West as the nomads which owned them moved across the globe. Exchanges of dogs, would often take place at the same time as the sale of sheep, further spreading the reach of this unusual looking dog. However, it became most common in the Alpine Arc, where its sheep herding abilities were a real asset and the dogs’ distinctive felted coat protected it from both the elements and attacks from wolves, bears and other wildlife which may have attacked the flock. For this reason, it is commonly referred to as a native breed of Italy.","The Bergamasco was carefully bred to have superb shepherding skills. The result is a breed which is strong, brave and highly intelligent. Though your Bergamasco may not be used for herding now, its ancestors were needed to watch over hundreds of sheep, making them attentive, problem solving dogs which have a protective streak. The Bergamasco is also a peaceful and reserved breed which is well balanced and not aggressive. Due to the independent nature of your Bergamasco, you should always show him an air of authority. Never speak harshly to your Bergamasco, but let him know who is boss by being calm and firm with him, setting rules and being consistent in keeping them. This is not the best breed for timid people to own as Bergamascos are happiest with a natural leader.","Bergamascos were bred to work and that’s what they love to do. They are always taking in their surroundings and watching what you are doing. Their protective temperament makes them wary of strangers and they will take some time sizing up any visitors which you may have. The positive side of this is that your Bergamasco makes an excellent watch and guard dog as they will alert you to any intruders without hesitation. Despite their guarding nature, Bergamascos are not aggressive dogs and love their families, only showing their more hostile side when there is a threat to the people they love. The Bergamasco has an affinity for children due to its patient and protective personality; they have been used as therapy dogs for handicapped children. This is why Bergamascos are sometimes nicknamed ‘Nanny Dogs’.","A medium sized breed, a Bergamasco’s body should be well proportioned and solidly compact. Bergamascos should have dark, oval eyes and a dark nose. The skull is rounded, while the short ears fall in triangles. Underneath the long, rustic coat is a powerful build which attributes to his strength, speed and agility. Bergamascos have a very distinctive look thanks to their unusual coat, which served the dogs well while they herded flocks of sheep in the cold, harsh conditions of areas such as the Alps. The coat is long, thick and has a shabby, ragged look it. The characteristic look of the coat is down to the Bergamascos’ three types of hair which form long, matted flocks which start at the spine and go down the flanks, growing until they touch the floor. The dense, felted coat provided protection from freezing conditions and predators. A curtain of hair also covers the eyes, which would protect the Bergamascos’ eyes from the bright glare of the sun as it reflected off the snow in the mountains in which they used to live.","The Bergamasco coat comes in a number of shades of grey, from pale silver to slate. This helped provide camouflage for the breed in snowy areas. Black and fawn colours are also seen and white patches may account for up to one fifth of coat.","Bergamascos are incredibly obedient dogs and providing they have a confident leader, they are an easy breed to train. They are very responsive to training and excel at agility classes. They love to please their owners, and submit to training as a way to show their affection, rather than showing submission. However, training must be done with respect, consistency, firmness and fairness as Bergamascos don’t respond well to harsh or heavy handed methods which tend to bring out their stubborn side. Positive reinforcement is recommended when training Bergamascos.","Bergamasco coats start out soft and fluffy when they are puppies, with the flocking stage starting between 8 months and one year and lasting until they are approximately two years old. Between the age of two and three, your Bergamasco’s coat will settle into a flocking pattern which will continue for the rest of his life. It is best to let the coat develop as naturally as possible, with little human intervention. Clipping or shaving a Bergamasco coat will destroy the flocks and the hair will grow out in massive matted clumps which cannot be combed. Once your Bergamasco’s coat is fully flocked, he’ll need very little grooming. The occasional brush will suit him just fine; just separate the flocks by hand and gently brush them, one at a time. Baths should only be given when absolutely necessary, as the coat can take a long time to dry. Seeing as the coat is low-odour this shouldn’t be too much of an issue. A bath 1 – 3 times per year is often enough, and spot cleaning when your Bergamasco gets messy is encouraged. The Bergamasco does not shed much, though you will find some hair on occasion during the puppy stage. When the coat is fully flocked, hair loss is minimal.  The Bergamasco coat is considered hair not fur and is therefore considered non-allergic, however this is no guarantee that it will be suitable for those with allergies","The lifespan of a healthy Bergamasco is typically between 13 and 15 years. They are generally an incredibly healthy breed of dog which is considered to be hardy. There are no known health issues or concerns with them, though this is partly due to their rarity as very little research has been conducted into the Bergamasco breed.",not available,Families People who like long walks People who are active People who live in the countryside Experienced dog owners,Protective of family Excellent watch and guard dog Patient and gentle with children Active and alert
Bernese Mountain Dog,not available,"The Bernese Mountain Dog gets his name from the Swiss canton of Bern and is one of four standard Swiss Mountain Dogs, but has a longer, smoother coat than the other three. The world “sennenhund” is derived from his environment. Senne are alpine pastures, and the Senn were the herdsman and dairymen who used this breed in their work. Indeed, Berners have been working dogs for hundreds of years, possibly from Roman times, guarding farms, protecting cattle and doing light draught work. They were first established as a breed in 1907 and became popular at pets in Europe and the US in the mid 1920’s. They became members of the Kennel Club in 1937 in the Working Group.","Your Berner is basically an outdoorsy person, though he will be well behaved in the house. He needs a lot of exercise to keep slim, but he lacks endurance, so he will make a better walking companion than someone to take running with you. However, as long as he is sound he will love a hike, and will stay close by you and not stray. Berners do not respond well to harsh training methods – praise and treats work a treat! He will get on well with your other pets, including cats, and even horses. Slow to mature, your Berner will show quite puppyish behaviour until he is as old as 2 ½ , so start his training and socialisation early on.","Your Berner is affectionate and loving, reliable and dependable, and very intelligent. He is also loyal and faithful to the point that if he loses his home and has to go to another family it can take a long time for his to settle in. Your Berner can tend towards shyness, though once he gets to know people, he will be soft and friendly with them. Aggression is rare in the Berner, but very exact standards of breeding are not always upheld, so do be careful to buy only from a reputable source.","Your Bernese Mountain Dog should look large, sturdy and imposing with a tri-coloured coat. The head should be broad, with a well defined stop, a long, straight muzzle with defined lips and smallish V shaped ears, softly drooping. The medium set eyes should be almond shaped and dark brown.  The strong, well muscled neck should lead to a compact body with a broad chest, strong loins with a rounded rump. The hindquarters should be strong with well bent stifles, well let down hocks which are parallel when viewed from behind. His feet should be short and round, and his bushy tail should reach to just below the hocks.","In the showing world, the pattern of the coat is important, basically black, with a white chest, and rust coloured “eyebrows” above the eyes, along the sides of the mouth, the fronts of the legs and a rusty fringe around the white chest. Ideally, he should have a white “horse shoe” around the nose and a white “Swiss Cross” on his chest when looked at from the front. A “Swiss Kiss” can often be seen as a white patch just behind or on the neck.","Your Berner will take easily to his training, provided it is done positively with lots of praise and rewards. As a youngster, he may be quite boisterous, so start early with training and socialisation, especially if he will be mixing with other dogs and especially horses when young.","Your Berner’s coat maybe rough in outline, but it is silky soft to touch with a fairly dense undercoat. It is pretty resistant to dirt and wet, so a good brush every week or two should suffice, unless he is in moult. Your Berner will shed all the year round, but every so often he will “blow” his undercoat at which time a few good groomings with a drag comb (looks like a small rake) will help him get rid of it all.","Your Berner is a very large dog, and as such has a relatively short lifespan, averaging only eight to ten years against an average of 10 to 11 years in other dogs of this size, including purebreds. In a 2004 survey done in the UK of 394 Berners which died that year, only one survived until the age of 15. The main cause of death in Berners is cancer, and other problems include arthritis, hip dysplasia, where the patella, or kneecap dislocates and re-locates itself, and cruciate ligament rupture. The cruciate ligament runs over the point of the hock and can easily slip off. Onset of these problems can occur as young as four or five. The answer is to keep your Berner as fit as you can without overworking him. Jumping and running in small circles should be avoided whenever possible, as these movements put a lot of strain on the joints. As with any dog, it is vital to ensure that you buy from a reputable breeder. When all is said and done, although your Berner may not make it to his teens, he will more than make up for this by the love and companionship he will bring you in his lifetime.","('Working Size: Large.

Bichon Frise,Small: Weight Male 7 – 12 lbs (3 – 5 kg) Female 7 - 12 lbs (3 – 5 kg) Height Male 9 – 12” (23 – 30 cm) Females 9 – 11” (23 – 28 cm),"The Bichon Frise originates from Spain, where it can be traced back to the 1200s. It is thought that the breed is a cross between the Barbet Water Spaniel and the Standard Poodle. The Bichon Frise became extremely popular among sailors and merchants who would take the little dogs on board their ships as companions on journeys. Due to their history on boats, Bichon Frises are known to love water. The Bichon Frise was taken all over Europe by the sailors who kept them as pets, and were often traded with locals and merchants on other countries. In the 14th Century the breed became a favourite of Italian nobility and they were frequently seen with their owners in Italian courts sporting a lion cut, as was the fashion for dogs at the time. During the French Renaissance and Henry III’s reign in the 1500s the Bichon Frise enjoyed a surge in popularity in France. This boost in popularity would continue during the reign of Napoleon III, but waned until the 1800s when Bichons were considered to be common and were often seen as stray dogs or companions of street entertainers or circus performers. In 1933 the Bichon Frise breed standard was created and the dogs once again found themselves in the limelight. A little over twenty years later, in 1955 the first Bichon Frises were brought to America and a year later a litter was born in the country. The breed has continued to be popular amongst American households ever since.","The Bichon Frise has a reputation for being a happy little dog with bags of character. They are cheerful, charming and bubbly pets and are known for putting a smile on everyone’s faces with their lively and merry personalities. If you want an affectionate and playful pup which also knows to respect your boundaries and can be gentle and sensitive, then the Bichon Frise could be for you. Bichons make wonderful family pets as they are well balanced, with an even temperament and tolerant nature, so they are superb with children as they love to play but won’t get too carried away. The Bichon Frise will also do well in a household with other pets as they were bred to be companions and love all kinds of company. You can expect your Bichon Frise to be a close friend, as he won’t want to leave your side. This is a breed which adores being around his owners, so the Bichon Frise is best suited to owners which will make him feel like part of the family and will cater to his social needs by giving him plenty of affection and attention.","Despite the Bichon Frise’s small size, they are an active and energetic breed which needs plenty of exercise. A daily walk will keep your Bichon Frise happy, healthy and better behaved. Plenty of play will also give him the exercise he needs, but should not be a replacement for a good walk once a day. Your Bichon Frise is an easy dog to live with; he adores human company and is intelligent and loving. His easy going and happy temperament makes the Bichon Frise a pleasure to take care of, but he is a sociable creature and needs to be around people in order to feel secure and happy. The Bichon Frise should not be left on his own for long periods of time as it will cause him distress. Although the Bichon Frise is not a yappy dog, like many small breeds, he does make a good watch dog and will raise the alarm if he senses trouble. Once used as circus dogs, Bichon Frises are easily trainable and enjoy learning tricks. However, the Bichon Frise can be prone to small dog syndrome which is caused by humans allowing the dog to get away with dominant behaviour. This can be prevented by showing your Bichon Frise that you are in charge and providing calm, confident and consistent training. With daily walks, training and showing your pet that you are the boss, you will find that your Bichon Frise is a calm, self-assured and charming pet.","The Bichon Frise is a small dog with a sturdy frame. The body had a rounded appearance with straight legs. The skull is somewhat rounded with a short muzzle that has a fairly pronounced stop and teeth which meet in a scissor bite. Small round eyes can be black or dark brown and the ears are dropped. The tail is carried up and over the back. The Bichon Frise has a soft double coat with a dense undercoat and curly, coarser outer coat.","The Bichon Frise’s coat can come in solid white, cream, grey or apricot although white is the preferred colour for show dogs.","Your Bichon Frise is smart as a button! He loves to learn and enjoys training providing it is kept fun and interesting. Your Bichon Frise has a natural predisposition for learning new tricks and will enjoy the bonding experience of a training session. Bichon Frises love to please their owners, making them a joy to train.","The Bichon Frise has a non-shedding coat which makes the breed suitable for allergy sufferers. The coat needs clipping by a professional groomer every 4 – 6 weeks and the hair around the eyes and ears may need trimming more often. The hair around the eyes should be cleaned regularly to prevent tear staining. To prevent the coat from becoming matted, you should brush your Bichon Frise every day.","The Bichon Frise is generally a healthy and hardy breed with a lifespan of 12-15 years, however they can be prone to some health issues including Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA), a condition which sees the dog’s immune system attack its own red blood cells.  Minor health concerns include watery eyes and cataracts, skin conditions, epilepsy and dislocated kneecaps. Some Bichon Frises can also be extremely sensitive to flea bites.",not available,Families Couples Older people Town or country folk People who enjoy a daily walk,Charming Sweet Happy Playful Sensitive Intelligent
Bloodhound,Large: Weight Male 90 – 110 lb (41 – 50 kg) Female 80 – 100 lb (36 – 45 kg) Height Male 25 – 27” (63 – 69 cm) Female 23 – 25” (58 – 63 cm),"The Bloodhound is one of the oldest breeds to date. Their ancestors first appeared in Europe thousands of years ago when two strains of hound—the black St. Hubert and the white Southern Hound—were brought from Constantinople. Belgian monks, bred the St. Hubert hounds during the Middle Ages, and eventually the dogs were brought to England by the Normans where they were bred to be durable hunters. Although bred as a hunter, the Bloodhound enjoys tracking most of all and they are commonly used both as a companion and a tracker, to track down game, criminals and lost children. This breed is also known as the Flemish Hound. Throughout the world, breeds such as the American Coonhounds, Swiss Jura Hounds, Brazilian Fila Brasileiro, Bavarian Mountain Hound, and many others trace their lineage back to this ancient scent tracker. Today, all Bloodhounds are black and tan or red, but in the Middle Ages they were solid in colour. The white variety, which existed in medieval Europe, was called the Talbot Hound, which became extinct in the 1600s, but contributed to the development of many other breeds including white Boxers and tri-coloured Basset Hounds. Bloodhounds thrive on the hunt rather than the kill and takes great pleasure in tracking. Their skills in tracking are so strong that they have earned a great reputation working as police dogs. However, today this slow mannered breed is both tracker and companion. Bloodhounds can be difficult to train despite their mellow nature, largely as they are easily distracted and always interested in any nearby strong smells rather than human command.",Bloodhounds are shy and placid but they can be sociable if given time and encouragement. They are not usually aggressive but can be wary of strangers. They have a tendency to wail at strange scents but does not bark as is often the case with other breeds of Hound.,"This breed is very gentle and mellow. They can be shy so it is necessary to encourage socialisation from a young age. As long as they have been trained and socialised properly Bloodhounds do very well with other dogs but they are not to be trusted around small animals. With children, Bloodhounds are extremely patient and gentle as they love attention but be aware not to let young children pester them too much, as a Bloodhound will patiently accept it. As a young dog they can be very energetic and boisterous outdoors and benefit greatly from a daily pack walk. It is important to keep a Bloodhound active both mentally and physically, otherwise they can become difficult to handle. This breed can be protective of their domain but with proper socialisation will greet visitors happily. Some Bloodhounds bark but they have a tendency to snore and howl at interesting scents. They are also droolers. Bloodhounds are able to follow any scent, including human scent which makes them excellent for tracking criminals and lost children. They have been known to follow trails over 100 hours old and can follow trails for over 100 miles. Their instinct to track scents is so strong that is unwise to keep them in an unfenced garden and off the lead because they will wander off if they pick up a trail.","Bloodhounds are large and powerful hound dogs with a very strong back. The head is long and narrow with a long muzzle and black nose. Their deeply sunken eyes and jowly face give them a somber but noble expression. Bloodhounds have a lot of extra skin which can hang in deep folds around the neck and head. The legs are very muscular and powerful and the tail is carried high with a slight curve above the top-line of the back. Bloodhounds stand proudly and dignified. Coat: The Bloodhound has a very short, hard coat that is close lying. The hair is softer on the ears and head but coarser on the rest of the body. They do not require much grooming but care should be taken to clean the ears regularly to avoid infections","The coat can be black and tan, liver and tan and red.",Bloodhounds are very intelligent and eager to please but can also be very sensitive so they require firm but not heavy handed training. They can be easily distracted by different scents so patience and consistency is required when training. Male Bloodhounds go through puberty between the ages of one and two and during this time they can be quite a handful so you must assert your authority as pack leader to keep them under control. After the age of two they usually mellow but require consistent training and socialisation to ensure they are stimulated and prevent them from becoming timid.,"Bloodhounds do not require much grooming but the folds of skin need to be cleaned regularly to avoid itchy, dry skin. Seasonally this breed can shed heavily but regular brushing will remove loose hair. Groom with a hound glove and only bathe when necessary. You can rub them with a rough towel to leave the coat gleaming. Bloodhounds have long, floppy ears so ensure that they are checked and cleaned regularly to avoid infections.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. Bloodhounds are prone to bloating so try to feed them two or three small meals a day rather than one large meal. This breed can also suffer from stomach cramps and are prone to hip dysplasia, ear infections and entropion where the eyelids turn inward. Calluses can form on their joints so a padded bed is recommended and regular cleaning of the ears will help prevent infection Exercise: Bloodhounds need regular exercise as they have a tendency to overeat. Regular exercise in large fenced in areas will help this breed stay healthy and active, while also ensuring they do not go wandering off as they have a tendency to roam when following a trail. With regular exercise of at least 90 minutes a day this breed with thrive, but it is important to keep them mentally as well as physically active to training is essential. Bloodhounds can do okay living in an apartment as long as they are sufficiently exercised and have access to an average sized yard. They have an incredible amount of stamina, able to walk for hours on end so they enjoy hiking but be aware of their instinct to try to pick up scents as you may find it difficult to get their attention.","('Hound',)",Singles Families Joggers Detectives,Easygoing Mellow Patient Playful
Bolognese,Small: Weight 9 – 11 lb (4 – 5 kg) Height Male 10.5 – 12” (27 – 30 cm) Female 10 – 11” (25 – 28 cm),"The Bolognese originated in Italy during the 11th century and is closely related to the Havanese and Bichon Frise. This breed was favoured by Renaissance nobility and was often presented to Belgian Royalty as gifts. With the passing of nobility the Bolognese nearly became extinct but the breed was restored and revived by Gian Franco Giannelli and is quite rare in the United States. The breed’s ancestors are the same as that of the Maltese and was mentioned in Latin by Aristotle (384 - 322 BC) under the denomination of ""canes melitenses"".  During the Roman era, the Bolognese was among the very appreciated gifts. Cosimo de Medici (1389 - 1464) brought no less than eight to Brussels as gifts to as many Belgian noblemen. Philipe II, king of Spain from 1556 to 1598, after having received two as a gift from the Duke d'Este, thanks the donor in writing saying ""that these two little dogs are the most royal gifts one can make to an emperor"".  Bolognese are represented in paintings of Titian, of Pierre Breughel called le Vieux and Goya.","This breed is small, sturdy and compact. They are extremely devoted to their owners and are very docile and exuberant. Bolognese are highly intelligent dogs with a happy expression and a sweet-natured disposition.","This breed does best in a home with older, considerate children and does well with other animals. The Bolognese are very devoted to their owners and can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time. Should separation anxiety occur, they can become destructive and bark incessantly. As small dogs they can be easily intimidated and are quite shy towards strangers but can benefit from proper socialisation as a puppy. They need to become accustomed to people and noises from a young age to avoid them being timid. They make very good watchdogs due to their keen eyesight and acute hearing.  Being a small dog, they can be prone to ‘Small Dog Syndrome’, human induced behaviours where the dog believes he is the pack leader. This can lead to separation anxiety, being timid and mournful howling when not being paid enough attention. The owner needs to affirm his stance as pack leader to avoid this.","The Bolognese is small and compact with a long, fluffy pure white coat. Square built, the length of the body is equal to the height at the withers. The length of the skull is slightly more than the muzzle. Eyelid opening is round and the eyeball must not be prominent. The rims of the eyelids must be black and the iris of a dark ochre colour. The ears are high set, long and hanging but rather rigid at the base. The hair is long all over the body, from head to tail, from the top-line to the feet. It is shorter on the muzzle. Rather fluffy, thus not lying flat, but in flocks; never forms fringes. Coat: The coat is long, dense and fluffy covering the entire body. They shed little to no hair but require daily brushing to prevent the coat from becoming matted.",The coat colour is pure white.,This breed is highly intelligent and responds well to obedience training. They require early socialisation and accustomisation to noise to prevent them from being timid. Bolognese are quick to learn but can be difficult to housetrain and the crate training method is recommended. Training this breed requires a firm yet fair hand to ensure you are seen as the pack leader. Bolognese are fine in an apartment as long as they are not left alone for extended periods of time and are provided with plenty of attention. This breed loves companionship and benefits from a daily walk or playing in a small yard. Dogs who are not taken on daily walks are more likely to display behaviour problems as they are not getting enough physical and mental exercise. Bolognese thrive on attention and without it can become bored and destructive,"Bolognese require daily brushing to prevent their coat from becoming matted, alongside monthly grooming sessions. They shed little to no hair.","Due to the rarity of this breed and limited human intervention, they do not have any major genetic health issues.","('Foundation Stock Service Category: Toy',)",Retirees City dwellers Families,Calm Dignified Reserved

They need lots of exercise to keep them physically and mentally occupied and usually get along well with other dogs and children. Problems may occur and they may show aggression towards other dogs if you are not firm in your leadership. They do not get along well with other household pets but there are plenty of Border Collies that live and get along well with cats. This breed needs good socialisation to get them accustomed to people and noise. Border Collies can be dominant so you must ensure you are a confident, firm and consistent pack leader to earn their respect. They can be highly reactive and sound sensitive so are not recommended for families with young children. The Border Collie is eager to please its master and lives to serve you but when they are not stimulated enough they may become destructive. If they become bored they can develop neurotic tendencies and display behavioural problems as well as trying to frequently escape. Their instinct to herd is strong so they may try to herd children, strangers and even vehicles unless you train them that this behaviour is unacceptable.","This breed is intelligent, responsive and devoted to their master and work. They are extremely sensitive and thrive on human interaction. They need a lot of activity and attention so are not recommended for inexperienced, sedentary, apathetic dog owners, nor a home with a two-career family as they do not do well when left alone for extended periods of time.

They are considered to be one of the oldest types of terriers in the UK although their purpose for hunting has waned and they now mostly serve as companions.  If needed though, their instincts still make them an excellent hunter and watchdog. When first bred, their purpose was to work on the farm in order to kill pests such as foxes, badgers, otters, mice and rats. Their size worked in their favour as they were considered tall enough to follow horses yet short enough to chase foxes into the ground. Although not as popular in the US, they are still utilized as vermin hunters on farms and the Border terrier was recognised by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1930.

Borzoi,Large: Weight Male 75 – 105 lb (34 – 48 kg) Female 60 – 90 lb (27 – 41 kg) Height Male at least 28” (71 cm) Female at least 26” (66 cm),"The Borzoi was originally called the Russian Wolfhound. They were developed by Russian nobles to hunt wolves. They were highly prized by nobles and aristocracy and could only be received as gifts from the Tsar. The breed became a fashionable hunting-party dog in the 19th century. While still employed for their hunting and guarding skills, the Borzoi has become a companion dog as its temperament has mellowed. The breed was developed by crossing the Arabian Greyhound and other longer haired Russian sheepdogs. They were known as Russian Wolfhounds in America until 1936 when the name was changed to “Borzoi”, which comes from the Russian word ‘borzii’ meaning swift. The Borzoi is a sight hound that relies on their agility and speed to hunt wolves, foxes and hares in the open planes of Russia. The Borzoi was recognised by the AKC in 1891.","The Borzoi is a tall and aristocratic breed and are considered to embody elegance and grace in their movement. They have a calm air of confidence and exude nobility and reticence. As a companion they are docile and devoted. The Borzoi’s talents including hunting, sighting and lure coursing.","The Borzoi is proud, sweet and alert. They are extremely affectionate and loyal to family and friends but can be aloof towards strangers. Borzoi’s are well behaved, quiet and seldom bark meaning they don’t make good watchdogs. This breed is not recommended for homes with small children, cats or other small pets but do well with other medium or large sized dogs that they have been brought up with. They are good companions for older, considerate children but are not well suited to career families as they can suffer depression and separation anxiety if left alone for extended periods of time. The Borzoi is slow to mature but extremely sensitive, intelligent and independent. The Borzoi benefits from gentle, firm and consistent training and needs an owner to display natural authority","The Borzoi have tall, slender frames with a narrow, slightly domed head. They have dark, slanting eyes and small ears that lay back on their heads. The tail is set low with a curve and the coat is long and silky and can be flat, wavy or curly. Coat: The Borzoi’s coat is silky and of moderate length with a thick plush under close to the body. They have a profuse neck mane and a longer, thick coat on the tail and back of the hind legs. The coat is dirt shedding and resistant to matting and can be flat, wavy or curly. The Borzoi encompasses a rugged, stylish grace.","The coat can be any shade from white, golden and, tan or grey with black markings. Their colouring can be mixed or solid.","As a sight-hound the Borzoi requires constant attention and restraint alongside basic obedience and socialisation. They excel in agility but do not respond well to harsh or heavy handed training methods. They benefit from an owner who has a natural authority and needs to be trained in a gentle but firm and consistent manner. The Borzoi requires calm, patient and consistent guidance with mutual respect. They are very clean dogs so are relatively easy to housetrain",The Borzoi is relatively easy to groom. They need regular brushing with a firm bristle brush and dry shampoo when necessary as bathing isn’t required very often. It is important to keep the hair on the pads trimmed to prevent spreading. Seasonally this breed is a heavy shedder.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. Borzoi’s are generally a healthy breed but can be prone to progressive retinal atrophy. They have a low tolerance to anaesthetic and a tendency to bloat so it is recommended to feed them small meals two or three times a day rather than one large meal. Exercise The Borzoi requires an excessive amount of exercise and make excellent jogging and walking partners provided they are on the lead. Indoors they can become bored and destructive if left alone for long periods of time and need plenty of space to run in a large securely fenced yard. They can adapt to apartment life provided they are sufficiently exercised. As hunting dogs, Borzoi are likely to run off after any prey it catches sight of so be prepared to react quickly to control them.","('Hound',)","Experienced dog handlers Active, sporty types Families with older children",Loving and kind Gentleman Loyal Independent Calm
Boston Terrier,Small: Weight 10 – 25 lb (4.5 – 11.3 kg) Height 15 – 17” (38.1 – 43 cm),"The Boston Terrier originated in the city of Boston, Massachusetts and is one of the few breeds that was developed in the USA. Bred in the 1870s, the Boston Terrier was originally a cross between the English Bulldog and now extinct English White Terrier. The Boston Terrier was continually bred down in size as originally they weighed up to 44 pounds (20 kg). By 1889 the breed was becoming popular in Boston and owners formed the American Bull Terrier Club but this name angered lovers of the Bull Terrier breed. Shortly after, the breed was renamed as the Boston Terrier after its birthplace and the breed was recognised by AKC in 1893. In the early years the colour and markings were not very important but by the 1900s the breeds distinctive markings and colour were written into the standard. Terrier only in name, the Boston Terrier has mellowed from the pit fighting dogs of the past. This breed has the distinction of being the first non-sporting dog to be bred in America.","The Boston Terrier is gentle, intelligent, well-mannered and enthusiastic. They require a good amount of mental and physical activity, otherwise they can become highly strung. However, they require an owner to display firm but gentle leadership to keep them under control as they can develop “Small Dog Syndrome”, human induced behaviours where the dog believes he is the pack leader. They have been reported as good watchdogs, barking when necessary but it has also been reported that female Boston Terriers do not bark at the door at all. They are mostly reliable with children, especially good with the elderly and very friendly with strangers. The Boston Terrier can be playful, affectionate and easygoing. They like to be part of the family and generally get along well with other household pets.","This breed thrives on human interaction and is affectionate and loyal to its family. The Boston Terrier is easygoing, yet can be animated and high-spirited. They are better suited to homes with children over the age of eight and are particularly well-suited to the elderly. They generally get along well with other household pets but males may fight with other dogs","Boston Terriers are compact and well-muscled dogs with a short, square body. They have a deep, wide, short muzzle and black nose. The bite is either even or slightly undershot which gives the muzzle a square look. It has large, round dark eyes that are wide-set with small ears. The legs are set slightly wide apart with a broad chest and slightly arched neck. The short tail is low-set and tapering, either straight or screw shaped but never docked. The coat is short and fine textured and comes in seal, brindle and white, black and white or brown and white.","The coat comes in seal, brindle and white, black and white or brown and white",Boston’s are quick to learn and easy to train. They can be difficult to housetrain and crate training is recommended. They can be sensitive so require a firm but gentle hand when being trained.,The Boston Terrier is short haired and easy to groom. Comb and brush with a firm bristle brush and bath only when necessary. This breed has a tendency to drool so frequent wiping of the face is recommended. It is important to check and clean both the eyes and ears regularly. This breed is an average shedder. The Boston Terrier is prone to heatstroke and should be monitored when playing outside on hot days.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual up to 15 years. However, some live for as long as 16 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. They are prone to eye problems such as juvenile cataracts, late-onset cataracts, entropion, distichiasis, glaucoma, corneal dystrophy, corneal ulcers, cherry eye and dry eyes (Keratitis Sicca). The eyes are prominent and can be prone to injury. This breed also suffers from deafness, patellar luxation, heart and skin tumours. Their short face means that they can have difficulty breathing when stressed by exertion in hot or cold weather and are prone to heatstroke. They may also snore or drool. Whelping is often difficult as the pelvis is narrow and the large headed pups are often delivered by caesarean section. Exercise: Boston Terriers can adapt to both apartment life and country living. They are relatively inactive indoors and can do okay without a yard but benefit from a long daily walk to keep them in shape. They are fairly lightweight and can be easily carried. This breed is particularly sensitive to weather extremes.","('Non-Sporting',)","Singles Seniors Active, outdoorsy types Families with older children",Easygoing Gentle Well-mannered Gentleman
Bouvier des Flandres,Large: Weight Male 75 – 110 lb (34 – 50 kg) Female 60 – 80 lb (27 – 36 kg) Height Male 23 – 28” (58 – 71 cm) Female 22 – 27” (56 – 69 cm),"The Bouvier des Flandres originated in Belgium by the working class who wanted to create a working dog rather than a show dog. Originally used by butchers, farmers or cattle merchants in their everyday work. The name, Bouvier des Flandres means “cowherd from Flanders” and the dog was given several nicknames such as “koehond” (cowdog), “vuilbaard” (dirty beard) and “toucheur de boeuf” or “pic” (cattle driver). During the World Wars they were used as message-carriers and rescue dogs but the breed was almost extinct by the end of World War I. In 1923 a group of people set about recreating the breed and formed a breed club in Belgium. The Bouvier is a talented watchdog, tracking dog and guide for the blind. They are skilled at search and rescue and work in both the police and the military. They are good at agility, competitive obedience and schutzhund.","The Bouvier des Flandres is an obedient dog and is pleasant natured and gentle. They need a good amount of exercise to keep them calm.  This breed is even tempered and fearless making them excellent guard and watchdogs. They are enthusiastic and learns relatively quickly making them easy to train, however they need an experienced owner to prevent dominance and overprotectiveness. The Bouvier des Flandres need socialising at an early age to avoid shyness and reservation with strangers. The Bouvier is excellent with children and extremely loyal. They get along well with other cats and dogs but beware of keeping them with other household pets. Dominant Bouvier’s can be aggressive towards other dogs and need a firm training and leadership from their owner. They are slow to mature, taking about two to three years.","The Bouvier is calm and quiet but extremely intelligent and good natured. This breed is better suited to more experienced dog owners as they require firm handling to avoid dominance problems. However, the Bouvier is very adaptable and given the right training is a great dog for family life","The Bouvier is a powerful and rugged looking dog. The head is in proportion with the body giving the dog a square profile. The dark brown eyes are oval in shape with black rims, framed but bushy eyebrows. It has a broad, tapered muzzle with high set ears that are either cropped or left natural. The tail is set high and usually docked. Note: it is illegal to crop or dock a dog’s tail and ears in most parts of Europe. Dewclaws are usually removed. The Bouvier has a double coat which is weather-resistant. It has a rough outer coat and a softer, dense undercoat. The coat is usually cut so it has a shaggy, thick beard and eyebrows giving the dog its distinctive look. Dutch bloodlines are often larger and heavier than Belgian lines. Coat: The Bouvier des Flandres is a thick, heavy coated dog with a distinctive beard and moustache. The coat needs extensive and regular grooming. The outer coat is rough, harsh and shaggy looking while the undercoat is soft and dense.","The coat can come in colours ranging from black, fawn, blonde, salt and pepper, grey or brindle, sometimes with a small white star on the chest. Solid black coats are not favoured in the show ring but are accepted. Blonde coats are not accepted.",The Bouvier is enthusiastic and quick to learn. This breed can be stubborn and dominant so consistent and firm training is required,"The Bouvier des Flandres needs a lot of grooming. The coat is long and needs regular brushing, but only needs bathing or dry shampoo when necessary. This breed needs trimming at least three times a year and extra trimming of excess hair inside the ears and between toes is required. The bouvier usually has its fur trimmed to give it round feet. Regular grooming prevents excessive shedding and it has been reported that the Bouvier is good for allergy sufferers","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. The Bouvier is prone to hip dysplasia and eye problems such as cataracts. Being cattle herding dogs, they have a high pain threshold and can withstand a lot of contact with cattle’s legs without feeling it which can make it difficult for veterinarian’s to find out the source of pain. The Bouvier has a tendency to pass wind. Exercise: The Bouvier will do okay in an apartment provided it is sufficiently exercised. It is relatively inactive indoors and would benefit from a large yard. This breed is energetic and active and enjoys long, brisk daily walks or running alongside a bike. Due to its dominant nature it is important to ensure that you make this dog walk to heel on the lead. During the growing stage exercise should be carefully regulated to ensure that the bones, muscles and joints are not too stressed.","('Herding',)","Active, sporty types Hikers and joggers People in cold climates Families",Friendly Obedient Mellow and patient Protective and fearless
Boxer,not available,"In the 1850s, a Bulldog (which actually resembled a small Mastiff) was exported from England to Munich. Years later, early Boxer fanciers used descendants of that Bulldog and the German Bullenbeisser to form the foundation of the modern breed, which was developed to be smaller and lighter than its predecessors. For a period of time, European Boxers probably were used in bull baiting – a betting-man’s “sport” that eventually was outlawed. In 1894, three Germans took steps to stabilize and exhibit the breed, which they did in Munich in 1895 for the first time and thereby brought Boxers to widespread prominence. The following year, the first German club devoted to the breed was founded as the Deutsche Boxer Club of Munich. The initial German breed standard was adopted in 1902, but was vigorously debated for several years by rival Boxer breeders and clubs. The source of the breed’s name is uncertain, although some fanciers speculate that it was coined by an Englishman in reference to the characteristic sparring gestures made with its front legs during play, that remain a hallmark of this breed. Other theories concerning the origin of the name “Boxer” include: 1) that it is a corruption of “beisser,” which means “biter”; 2) that it is a corruption of the word “boxl” or “boxeln,” which were nicknames for one of the Boxer’s ancestors, a now-extinct breed called the Brabanter; and 3) that it was coined simply because the dogs were “prize fighters” It was one of the first breeds to be employed as a police and military dog in Germany and by the 1900’s it had become a fully established breed as a general utility dog, also a family pet and even a show dog. Now found to be Americas top four most popular breeds.","The character of the boxer is of the greatest importance and demands the most careful attention. He can be described as a ‘hearing’ guard dog, meaning he is very alert and watchful, that’s when he’s not clowning around for you, he is dignified and self-assured. He is renowned from olden times for his great love and faithfulness to his master and household, his alertness and by far his fearless courage as a defender and protector. The boxer can be rather docile at times, but watch for his distrust in strangers. But by far a bright and friendly kind in play, and brave and determined when roused. His intelligence and willing tractability, his modesty and cleanliness makes him a highly desirable family dog and cheerful companion. Never false or treacherous even as an old man.","The boxer is a high energy, extremely playful, exuberant dog. With it’s attentive, devoted and outgoing nature makes for a perfect companion for the family household. Although sometimes stubborn he has a sensitive side, enough to be responsive to commands and intelligent enough to make sense of it all. Being an athletic, energetic type he also shows a very sweet, caring side and known for his way with children. Despite their history of being used for dog fighting, boxers are typically very gentle creatures and sometimes quite goofy and a clumsy appeal with huge puppy dog eyes. Their temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training and socialization. Pups with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them.","The boxer is a medium to large sized, study, smooth haired dog of a stocky, square figure and very strong limbed. A compact build resulting in a powerful breed, but equally as elegant and nimble. He is an exemplary breed in this combination- stylish elegance with strength and agility, his stride is free and ground covering, with a proud carriage.  With a distinctive head, broad and blunt muzzle and alert expression and a shorthaired silky coat makes him perfect suitor to serve as a working watchdog.","Brindle, Fawn, and White. (Although white is actually an increased amount of flash- which is the white patches on the other colour options)","Because of their tendency to be hyperactive and unruly it’s essential to start intensive training as early on. Simply down to their big loving personalities they love to jump in on everything and be the center of attention, this is easily refrained if necessary. Their high level of energy and physiques make significant daily training, a lot of mental stimulation is essential for a well-balanced dog. Early socialization as well as training is critical as can become a real handful, and for you yourself to have an almost equal level of energy can help the relationship. Exposure to people and dogs ensures they grow up to be a well-balanced, outgoing and friendly dog. Due to their size and strength if its not direct well it can lead to clumsy accidents, they need to learn how to direct control and become the best they can. Getting him to take training seriously requires starting early and using firm, fair training methods and positive motivation in the form of praise, play, and food rewards. Be consistent. Your Boxer will notice any time you let him get away with something, and he'll push to see what else he can get away with. Before you head to training class, settle him down a little with an energetic walk or play session. He'll focus better once he's got his ya-yas out. Leadership should be shown with confidence. Boxers will take advantage of anyone who gives them even the slightest bit of leeway. Positive reinforcement and treats are the best method for training this breed, and harsh tones and discipline should be avoided. Once leadership roles have been established, Boxers can excel in advanced obedience and often benefit from agility training. Patience is the key to housetraining your Boxer. Some are housetrained by 4 months of age, but others aren't reliable until they're 7 months to a year old. Take your Boxer out to potty on a regular schedule and praise him wildly when he does his business outdoors. Crate training is recommended.","Boxers are housedogs. Their short noses and short coats make them unsuited to living outdoors, although they'll enjoy having a fenced yard to play in. Boxers love to play. To keep their muscles toned and satisfy their need for exercise, plan on playing with them or walking them at least twice a day for half an hour. Play fetch, take him for long walks, or get him involved in dog sports such as agility or fly ball. Giving your Boxer plenty of daily exercise is the best way to ensure good behavior. A tired Boxer is a good Boxer. Although they are large you would assume they need to be outdoors, but actually this breed are definitely not. Their short noses and short hair make them very uncomfortable in hot and cold weather, so are ideally better off as household dogs. The Boxer's short coat is relatively no-fuss. They are clean dogs that groom themselves, much like cats do. Weekly brushing will keep their year-round shedding under control and occasional wipes with a chamois cloth will keep the coat shiny. Boxers only need to be bathed as needed, which usually means once every three or four months. It is suggested that Boxers get their teeth brushed on a weekly basis to keep tartar, gum disease and bad breath at bay.","The average life span of the Boxer is 11 to 14 years. They are not particularly well suited to living in climates with temperature extremes. Boxers historically had cropped ears and docked tails, although the AKC standard permits both cropped and natural ears without preference. Undocked tails are still severely penalized in the American breed standard. Boxers are unfortunately prone to a number of health conditions, some which are genetic in origin with some devastating consequences. So it is very important that your breeder is one that breeds only properly health tested stock. The boxer is prone to several serious genetically inherited health issues such as Aortic stenosis, boxer cardiomyophy and hip dysplasia.  White boxers are also very prone to being blind.",not available,Active Families with children High-level energy Happy High Spirited Good sense of humour,"Clownish High Spirited Outgoing Energetic Intelligent Headstrong Courageous Is this Boxer for you?

Popularity: In 1894, three Germans named Roberth, Konig, and Hopner decided to stabilize the breed and put it on exhibition at a dog show. This was done in Munich in 1895, and the next year they founded the first Boxer Club. The breed became known in other parts of Europe in the late 1890s. Around 1903, the first Boxers were imported into the U.S. The American Kennel Club registered the first Boxer in 1904. When Word War I broke out, Boxers were enlisted into the military, serving as messenger dogs, carrying packs, and acting as attack and guard dogs. Boxers started becoming popular in the U.S. in the 1940s when soldiers coming home from World War II brought their Boxer mascots with them. Through them, the breed was introduced to more people and soon became a favorite companion animal, show dog, and guard dog. The American Boxer Club (ABC) was formed in 1935 and gained acceptance by the AKC in the same year. In the early days, there was a lot of controversy within the club about the Boxer standard. In 1938, the club finally approved a new standard. The latest revisions of the standard were in 2005.

Their temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training and socialization. Pups with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Conformation: The boxer is a medium to large sized, study, smooth haired dog of a stocky, square figure and very strong limbed. A compact build resulting in a powerful breed, but equally as elegant and nimble. He is an exemplary breed in this combination- stylish elegance with strength and agility, his stride is free and ground covering, with a proud carriage.  With a distinctive head, broad and blunt muzzle and alert expression and a shorthaired silky coat makes him perfect suitor to serve as a working watchdog. Colour: Brindle, Fawn, and White. (Although white is actually an increased amount of flash- which is the white patches on the other colour options) Training: Because of their tendency to be hyperactive and unruly it’s essential to start intensive training as early on. Simply down to their big loving personalities they love to jump in on everything and be the center of attention, this is easily refrained if necessary. Their high level of energy and physiques make significant daily training, a lot of mental stimulation is essential for a well-balanced dog. Early socialization as well as training is critical as can become a real handful, and for you yourself to have an almost equal level of energy can help the relationship. Exposure to people and dogs ensures they grow up to be a well-balanced, outgoing and friendly dog. Due to their size and strength if its not direct well it can lead to clumsy accidents, they need to learn how to direct control and become the best they can. Getting him to take training seriously requires starting early and using firm, fair training methods and positive motivation in the form of praise, play, and food rewards. Be consistent. Your Boxer will notice any time you let him get away with something, and he'll push to see what else he can get away with. Before you head to training class, settle him down a little with an energetic walk or play session. He'll focus better once he's got his ya-yas out. Leadership should be shown with confidence. Boxers will take advantage of anyone who gives them even the slightest bit of leeway. Positive reinforcement and treats are the best method for training this breed, and harsh tones and discipline should be avoided. Once leadership roles have been established, Boxers can excel in advanced obedience and often benefit from agility training. Patience is the key to housetraining your Boxer. Some are housetrained by 4 months of age, but others aren't reliable until they're 7 months to a year old. Take your Boxer out to potty on a regular schedule and praise him wildly when he does his business outdoors. Crate training is recommended. Care: Boxers are housedogs. Their short noses and short coats make them unsuited to living outdoors, although they'll enjoy having a fenced yard to play in. Boxers love to play. To keep their muscles toned and satisfy their need for exercise, plan on playing with them or walking them at least twice a day for half an hour. Play fetch, take him for long walks, or get him involved in dog sports such as agility or fly ball. Giving your Boxer plenty of daily exercise is the best way to ensure good behavior. A tired Boxer is a good Boxer. Although they are large you would assume they need to be outdoors, but actually this breed are definitely not. Their short noses and short hair make them very uncomfortable in hot and cold weather, so are ideally better off as household dogs. The Boxer's short coat is relatively no-fuss. They are clean dogs that groom themselves, much like cats do. Weekly brushing will keep their year-round shedding under control and occasional wipes with a chamois cloth will keep the coat shiny. Boxers only need to be bathed as needed, which usually means once every three or four months. It is suggested that Boxers get their teeth brushed on a weekly basis to keep tartar, gum disease and bad breath at bay. Health: The average life span of the Boxer is 11 to 14 years. They are not particularly well suited to living in climates with temperature extremes. Boxers historically had cropped ears and docked tails, although the AKC standard permits both cropped and natural ears without preference. Undocked tails are still severely penalized in the American breed standard. Boxers are unfortunately prone to a number of health conditions, some which are genetic in origin with some devastating consequences. So it is very important that your breeder is one that breeds only properly health tested stock. The boxer is prone to several serious genetically inherited health issues such as Aortic stenosis, boxer cardiomyophy and hip dysplasia.  White boxers are also very prone to being blind.

The breed is famously known for being owned by such historical figures such as Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson, Lafayette, and Charlemagne. With its heightened sense of hearing, this breed was often used by the French Army to search for wounded soldiers.

If you don’t mind sparing time for his vigorous exercise requirements, frequent brushing and combing as lets face it Briards have a lot of hair, enough time to train and socialize him, allowing his herding, guarding ways then he is right for you.

Brittany,not available,"In the mid-1800s, French sportsmen crossed their small land spaniels with English setters in attempts to produce a dog better suited for their needs. Some of the offspring were tailless, and their descendants continued to be tailless or stub-tailed. More importantly, they were excellent woodcock hunters with strong noses. These dogs soon became popular not only with the French gentry but also with poachers, because they would both point and retrieve and were extremely obedient. Although registered as the Brittany spaniel with the AKC from 1934, the word spaniel was dropped in 1982 in recognition of the dog's hunting style, which is more like that of a setter than a spaniel.","With a real zest for life, Brittany’s are a happy, energetic breed that loves the outdoors. They are excellent family dogs that love to go on hunting and outdoors trips with dad as much as they enjoy playing with children in the back yard. They are even-tempered and loyal, making their family their pack and they can always be counted on to be happy and affectionate. The dog’s good nature and natural eagerness to please makes it a great companion pet and easily trainable, but potential owners should be aware that the breed requires plenty of exercise – let your Brittany roam in open areas whenever you can, especially with other dogs. The Brittany is highly trainable and obedient but is also very sensitive to reprimand; take care not to chastise your Brittany too roughly, or it may become shy and fearful. The dog is a natural socializer and gets along exceedingly well with other dogs and children, though small children should never be left alone with a Brittany as the dog’s natural energetic play could cause the child accidental harm. The Brittany’s athleticism and friendliness make it equally attractive as a hunting buddy or a lifelong companion. Brittany’s are known for having a keen nose and a very biddable disposition; they bond an work closely with their human partners. This allows the Brittany's success in field trials, hunting tests, conformation shows, obedience trials, agility trials, tracking tests, and just about anything else they are given a chance at. The Brittany is easily handled, but sensitive if treated harshly. When not enjoying the sporting life, the Brittany can content himself at home as family pet and guardian.

Intelligent and eager to please, with daily exercise the Brittany makes an excellent family pet and companion","The Brittany is a very quick and curious dog, always on the lookout for birds or for fun. It loves to run, scout, hunt and play. It has a very independent nature, befitting any pointing breed, yet it is sensitive and is very responsive to human direction. The Brittany is a force to be reckoned with, having the urge to hunt fixed into its temperament. It must be remembered at all times that gundogs must in general, by their very being, be a social animal without vices, not only with their human companions, but also with other dogs. It is not very often that a shooting day has only one dog present - there are many - and the dog's temperament must be such that it is a pleasure to take with you on such outings, not a pain to have to guard against unfortunate encounters with others.

The Brittany came to America (Mexico) around 1925 and was AKC recognized in 1925. The breed took a while to be accepted, mostly because hunters expected a pointing dog to have a long tail. When the dogs were given a chance, however, they proved their mettle and have since become the most popular of all pointing breeds at field trials. In fact, registrations eventually soared to place the Brittany among the top 20 in popularity, no doubt because of its bird-hunting abilities, close-ranging hunting style, small size and tractable nature. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3> Breed History: In the mid-1800s, French sportsmen crossed their small land spaniels with English setters in attempts to produce a dog better suited for their needs.

Bull Terrier,not available,"The “New Bull Terrier” first appeared in its present form at a Birmingham show in May 1862. It was shown by James Hinks, a dog dealer, who is generally accepted as the original breeder of the Bull Terrier, whose family has being associated with Bull Terriers until the present day. Bull Terriers are almost universally believed to be the result of crossing a Bulldog to the now-extinct White English Terrier, which produced a type of dog known as the Bull-and-Terrier. Sportsmen for sportsmen, as well as to be a gentleman’s trusted companion, developed the Bull Terrier. They were bred to be tough, courageous, athletic and powerful and to have a sense of fair play – never initiating controversy, but not backing down once provoked. Hence, the white variety soon earned the nickname “The White Cavalier.” the breed was developed specifically to be set against other dogs in illegal pit contests, for purposes of “gentlemen’s sport” after the blood-sport of bull-baiting was outlawed in England in or around 1835. Once bull baiting was outlawed, the enthusiasts went underground, fighting bulldogs against bulldogs in “pits.” Apparently, the bulldogs were too slow to please the crowds, so people began crossing bulldogs with terriers to create a better fighting breed","A Bull Terrier has been likened to a mischievous three-year-old child in a fur coat but with the constitution of an armored tank. The breed is officially described as “obstinate” although “particularly good with people” and “of even temperament and amenable to discipline.” They love people unconditionally, even vets, and absolutely adore children. They believe that owners exist entirely to be company for them, to be sat on, to share the settee with, to be played with, or walked with. Physical contact whenever possible is a prime objective. Children are for playing, cuddling, and if necessary, watching over. Though most Bull Terriers are friendly with other dogs they can be territorial and resent the intrusion of other dogs on ‘their’ patch. Bull Terriers are brainy and think for themselves. Cunningly, they pretend to be stupid, unable to understand the simplest of instructions, and so get their own way. Bull Terriers have two characteristics, which are unique to the breed. The first is that they ‘trance’ (or ‘ghost walk ’) The dog’s eyes glaze and movement is in ultra slow motion; the dog almost looks as though it is stalking prey whilst sleep walking. In sharp contract, the second unique activity takes place at top speed. It is variously called ‘freaking’. The dog suddenly takes off at full speed and sprints all over the house, round rooms, in and out of furniture, often in a figure of eight. The best ‘freaks’ involve going at full speed head first towards a wall/door/piece of furniture, and then at the last minute doing a half turn to slam","Although there is much discussion regarding the safety of owning a Bull Terrier Bull Terriers are no more or less aggressive towards people than any other dog. The Bull Terrier is a fun, comical, people-loving dog. They are known to be courageous, scrappy, fun loving, active, clownish and fearless. They enjoy being around people, sometimes a little too much, and can prove positively dangerous to people of a delicate nature, not through malicious intent, but rather through their exuberance; as such the Bull Terrier is not recommended for households with small children if the owner is a first time Bull Terrier owner. But then again no animals should be left alone with a child. A true trait is also both independence and stubbornness, and for this reason is not considered suitable for an inexperienced dog owner. A firm hand and an assertive demeanor are essential if the Bull Terrier is not to run riot. They are also fiercely protective although comprehensive socialization at an early age will prevent them becoming over-protective and neurotic. The breed was developed to hunt vermin and to fight, so this dog’s temperament needed to be courageous and determined. This often leads to your Bull Terrier challenging your leadership at some stage. The Bull Terrier can be extremely territorial and protective of his family, particularly when strangers are about. He is an excellent watchdog; even if he isn’t aggressive towards people, his impressive demeanor will deter any unwelcome visitors. When it comes to other animals, caution should be the byword. Bull Terriers have a strong prey instinct and can cause injury or death to other animals, especially cats. That said, puppies brought up or socialized with cats and other animals can get on well with the animals they know. With other dogs, unaltered males may not get along with other male dogs. Males and females can live together happily, and two females can also be a good combination with care and supervision","The Bull Terrier's most recognizable feature is its head, described as 'egg shaped' when viewed from the front, the top of the skull is almost flat from ear to ear. His profile curves gently downwards from top of skull to tip of nose, which should be black and bent downwards at tip. Nostrils are well developed and under-jaw deep and strong snout. The unique triangle-shaped eyes are small, dark, and deep-set. The body is full and round, while the shoulders are robust and very muscular and the tail is carried horizontally By selective breeding the Bull Terrier has today developed into a companion animal and much loved family pet. He is extremely affectionate with people, and is particularly noted for a fondness towards young children.  Nevertheless he is a strong and powerful animal, and it should always be remembered that he is a first and foremost a Terrier with a competitive spirit and may not always be tolerant of other animals, though many live together in a household quite happily with other pets.",,"A Bull Terrier must have training and even the laziest owner will need to complete some schedule. Obviously, house training in a puppy is an early must, a “Dirty” and rapidly growing puppy will cause friction in any household and the sooner the newcomer adopts social habits the better. It is not a good idea to shut them out and leave them for long periods – that will teach them nothing. Putting them out first thing in the morning means just that, first thing, and not after the kettle has being put on.   Lead training is essential, taking any untrained dog on a lead is hard work, and with a Bull Terrier it is a short cut to a long arm or a heart attack! All experienced Bull Terrier breeders will know of “trained” Bull Terriers who have come to harm through their owners carelessness, in not appreciating the dangers for a dog not on a lead.   Exercise needs will vary from dog to dog, some enjoy unlimited walking whilst others will satisfy their needs within the confines of the house. However a general rule of thumb is that two 30 min walks per day are sufficient for most Bull Terriers. They will fit in with their owner’s habits – human companionship is what they are really after. Bullies are intelligent and have a mind of their own. Training should be started early and always done in calm-assertive manner, as they won't respond to discipline or harsh tones. Training is best done in short sessions due to Bull Terriers' short attention span and they will quickly become uninterested, even if treats are used as a reward. Lots of patience is necessary when working with a Bull Terrier, as training can be a long process. Even after a Bull Terrier is fully trained, they may decide to test their boundaries as they get older and project dominance. These situations should be handled with calm assertion; like a teenager, they just want to see what they can get away with.","An adult will often fit in to a working household routine and adjust its sleeping habits to correspond with its owner’s absence; even so, being left all the day is not desirable. Items left carelessly on the floor are always a temptation to any dog. Bull Terriers are no exception. The plastic toy when swallowed, and under x-ray not discernible, is the cause of many dog deaths and the responsibility must rest with the owner. Bull Terriers are very easy to groom. They only require weekly brushing in order to keep their coat looking shiny and to keep loose hair under control. They do shed heavily in the spring and fall, and brushing will need to occur daily.","Bull Terriers have an average life expectancy between 10 and 12 years. Breed health concerns may include allergies, congenital deafness, familial nephropathy, mitral dysplasia, patellar luxation, hip and elbow dysplasia and zinc deficiency. They also are prone to eye problems such as entropion and ectropion, as well as enlarged hearts and bone cancer.",not available,Active Sporty Families Strong willed Experienced,"Protective Polite Lively Devoted Tough Muscular Happy Goofy Tenacious Is this Bull Terrier for you?

The dog suddenly takes off at full speed and sprints all over the house, round rooms, in and out of furniture, often in a figure of eight. The best ‘freaks’ involve going at full speed head first towards a wall/door/piece of furniture, and then at the last minute doing a half turn to slam Temperament: Although there is much discussion regarding the safety of owning a Bull Terrier Bull Terriers are no more or less aggressive towards people than any other dog. The Bull Terrier is a fun, comical, people-loving dog. They are known to be courageous, scrappy, fun loving, active, clownish and fearless. They enjoy being around people, sometimes a little too much, and can prove positively dangerous to people of a delicate nature, not through malicious intent, but rather through their exuberance; as such the Bull Terrier is not recommended for households with small children if the owner is a first time Bull Terrier owner. But then again no animals should be left alone with a child. A true trait is also both independence and stubbornness, and for this reason is not considered suitable for an inexperienced dog owner. A firm hand and an assertive demeanor are essential if the Bull Terrier is not to run riot. They are also fiercely protective although comprehensive socialization at an early age will prevent them becoming over-protective and neurotic. The breed was developed to hunt vermin and to fight, so this dog’s temperament needed to be courageous and determined. This often leads to your Bull Terrier challenging your leadership at some stage. The Bull Terrier can be extremely territorial and protective of his family, particularly when strangers are about. He is an excellent watchdog; even if he isn’t aggressive towards people, his impressive demeanor will deter any unwelcome visitors. When it comes to other animals, caution should be the byword. Bull Terriers have a strong prey instinct and can cause injury or death to other animals, especially cats. That said, puppies brought up or socialized with cats and other animals can get on well with the animals they know. With other dogs, unaltered males may not get along with other male dogs. Males and females can live together happily, and two females can also be a good combination with care and supervision Conformation: The Bull Terrier's most recognizable feature is its head, described as 'egg shaped' when viewed from the front, the top of the skull is almost flat from ear to ear. His profile curves gently downwards from top of skull to tip of nose, which should be black and bent downwards at tip. Nostrils are well developed and under-jaw deep and strong snout. The unique triangle-shaped eyes are small, dark, and deep-set. The body is full and round, while the shoulders are robust and very muscular and the tail is carried horizontally By selective breeding the Bull Terrier has today developed into a companion animal and much loved family pet. He is extremely affectionate with people, and is particularly noted for a fondness towards young children.  Nevertheless he is a strong and powerful animal, and it should always be remembered that he is a first and foremost a Terrier with a competitive spirit and may not always be tolerant of other animals, though many live together in a household quite happily with other pets. Colour: Training: A Bull Terrier must have training and even the laziest owner will need to complete some schedule. Obviously, house training in a puppy is an early must, a “Dirty” and rapidly growing puppy will cause friction in any household and the sooner the newcomer adopts social habits the better. It is not a good idea to shut them out and leave them for long periods – that will teach them nothing. Putting them out first thing in the morning means just that, first thing, and not after the kettle has being put on.   Lead training is essential, taking any untrained dog on a lead is hard work, and with a Bull Terrier it is a short cut to a long arm or a heart attack! All experienced Bull Terrier breeders will know of “trained” Bull Terriers who have come to harm through their owners carelessness, in not appreciating the dangers for a dog not on a lead.   Exercise needs will vary from dog to dog, some enjoy unlimited walking whilst others will satisfy their needs within the confines of the house. However a general rule of thumb is that two 30 min walks per day are sufficient for most Bull Terriers. They will fit in with their owner’s habits – human companionship is what they are really after. Bullies are intelligent and have a mind of their own. Training should be started early and always done in calm-assertive manner, as they won't respond to discipline or harsh tones. Training is best done in short sessions due to Bull Terriers' short attention span and they will quickly become uninterested, even if treats are used as a reward. Lots of patience is necessary when working with a Bull Terrier, as training can be a long process. Even after a Bull Terrier is fully trained, they may decide to test their boundaries as they get older and project dominance. These situations should be handled with calm assertion; like a teenager, they just want to see what they can get away with. Care: An adult will often fit in to a working household routine and adjust its sleeping habits to correspond with its owner’s absence; even so, being left all the day is not desirable. Items left carelessly on the floor are always a temptation to any dog. Bull Terriers are no exception. The plastic toy when swallowed, and under x-ray not discernible, is the cause of many dog deaths and the responsibility must rest with the owner. Bull Terriers are very easy to groom. They only require weekly brushing in order to keep their coat looking shiny and to keep loose hair under control. They do shed heavily in the spring and fall, and brushing will need to occur daily. Health: Bull Terriers have an average life expectancy between 10 and 12 years. Breed health concerns may include allergies, congenital deafness, familial nephropathy, mitral dysplasia, patellar luxation, hip and elbow dysplasia and zinc deficiency. They also are prone to eye problems such as entropion and ectropion, as well as enlarged hearts and bone cancer.

They are not a dog suited to everyone and require a lot of patience; determination and an iron will if they are to be raised successfully.  Ease of training is not a trait of the Bull Terrier, quite the contrary. They are like naughty children. The circumstance of any owners working full time is really not suitable to a Bull Terrier puppy. They need care, in feeding and in attention. The puppy that is left on its own will chew – bored growing puppies do, and they chew hard. A Bull Terrier is a never-ending source of amazement, frustration and love. Scratch its head to produce that unique snorting purr, a real smile and shining eyes. But they are not for everyone, they are special dogs for special people - people who have stamina, even more determination than the dogs, and who can give them the time and attention they crave.

Bullmastiff,"Large: Male height: 25 – 27” (64 – 69 cm) to shoulder, female 24 – 26” (61 – 66 cm) Male weight 110 – 130 lb (50 – 59 kg) Female 90 – 110 lb (41 – 50 kg)","Bullmastiffs are derived from crossing Old English Mastiffs with Bulldogs, though not the short, squash faced Bulldogs we know today, but the old fashioned kind with longer legs and noses. Historically they were always used as guard dogs, and also used to help gamekeepers catch and arrest poachers. Being gentle, devoted creatures at heart, they are now accepted as being excellent house dogs.","Your Bullmastiff is intelligent and observant and easily trained although he does need a reason for doing what you ask of him. He is physically and mentally one of the most reliable of breeds, though takes time to mature, roughly 3 ½ years. Bullmastiffs are naturally playful and upbeat and make great walking or hiking companions as they need at least two hours exercise every day. Out walking, he can be strong, but will be obedient if his training has been thorough. At home he will be good with any other pets he has been brought up with. Your Bullmastiff is a quiet dog, and will only bark if he thinks there is something to be alarmed about. You’ll always feel safe as long as he is around.","Gentle, playful and sweet natured, your Bullmastiff is someone you can rely on to always be the same. Not moody or difficult but totally devoted to his family. But if anyone threatens you, he will defend you with absolute courage and bravery. He is quick to assess a situation, and will sense that it’s time to go and play or go for a walk before you’ve got out of your chair. His hearing is very acute, and he can tell you someone is at the door minutes before they get there, and tell you when Master’s car has just turned the corner 200 yards away. He will take pride in his duties, and thrives on praise and cuddles.","Your Bullmastiff should give a powerful, symmetrical impression, showing great strength, but not cumbersome. His head should be large and square, wrinkled when interested, but not when in repose. He should have a pronounced stop, and a short, blunt muzzle, square at the nose which should be broad with wide spread nostrils. His flews should not hang below his lower jaw. Dark or hazel eyes (not yellow!) should be wide set with a slight furrow between. His v-shaped ears should be set on wide and high and folded back. He should have a well arched neck of moderate length, very muscular with almost the same circumference as the skull. He should have a deep, broad chest, sloping but muscular shoulders and his forelegs should be straight and strong, set wide apart making a straight line down from the shoulder. His back should be short and straight, leading to wide, muscular loins and strong hind legs. Avoid cow hocks, as they are a weakness. His feet should be well arched and catlike with nice tight toes. His tail should be set on high, length to reach his hocks. His coat should be short and hard, never woolly or long, weather resistant, lying flat to his body.","Bullmastiffs can be fawn, red or brindle, and although a solid colour is preferred, a little white on the chest is permissible","Your Bullmastiff is an amenable chap, and is easy to train. Just don’t ask him to do something just for the sake of it. He needs a reason to do anything, and is too intelligent to be fooled. He matures late, around 3 ½ and will retain his puppyish playfulness well into middle age, so make sure to have the occasional practice session to keep him up to scratch.","As far as grooming goes, once a week is ideal. Your Bullmastiff will shed all the year round, so regular brushing will help him get rid of his spare hair.","Like most very large dogs, Bullmastiffs are not long lived, eight to ten years being the average, though some do not make it that far due to ill health. Most of the diseases are hereditary, especially hip and elbow dysplasia, cancer and hypothyroidism. Arthritis is common as in most very large dogs, and also gastric torsion (bloat). Bloat can be prevented by taking care to feed your Bullmastiff several small meals a day and not exercising too soon after a meal. With care and attention, your healthy Bullmastiff should be a happy, high spirited pal a good long time.","('Working',)",Outdoor types Walkers Hikers Families Singles,Reliable Loyal Devoted Brave Intelligent
Cairn Terrier,not available,"The exact origins of the Cairn have slightly been lost in the mists of Scottish history, but what is known is its descended from the original indigenous working terrier from the Highlands. Way back when King James 1st ruled in the 1500s there were references to the Cairn as a group of the terriers where sent to the King who thought of them highly. The dogs were used by crofters, shepherds and fox hunters mainly for pest control purposes against foxes, rats and rabbits which was their earliest quarry, but welcoming the eighteenth century and its emphasis on sporting pursuits, the dogs were used more against badgers and otters. They excelled at ‘gameness’ – the ability to ignore pain and continue to fight on- in fact became quite legendary. From the mid nineteenth century the differences began to resolve and the separate breeds of terrier started to appear- the Skye, Scottish and the West highland White all became a lot more established, but their progenitor the Cairn stayed comparatively unknown. It wasn’t until 1910 that the Kennel Club accepted the breed for its short coated, prick eared appearance. The breed was named after the rocks (cairns), which were erected to mark a boundary or grave. These rocks became the favourite hiding place for foxes and other pests and a small but fearless terrier was required to rout out the vermin.","When most people hear the word terrier, they picture Toto, the Cairn Terrier in The Wizard of Oz -- and rightfully so, because this sturdy little dog breed is everything a terrier was designed to be: strong, hardy, up on his toes, confident, plucky, and spirited. The Cairn Terrier loves to play and needs his daily walks, but is adaptable to any home in which he can be a full participant and busybody and where his bold terrier traits are kept under control. Adult Cairn Terriers may be friendly or reserved with strangers, but are always alert and quick to announce guests. They love their families and need attention and affection from their humans. They are protective of their families, and will defend their territory with courage and devotion. They love long walks and like to play ball, or simply tear around the backyard with the kids. They excel at obedience, agility, and tracking trials. They remain active and playful well into their teen years and by far extremely companionable, loyal and loving. They make great listeners, perky playmates, and good foot warmers. They've been nicknamed ""the best little pal in the world."" He loves people, is an able swimmer and a great hunter. Ready for any activity, he makes an ideal companion for a family, fitting in well with any lifestyle. Although very small children and Cairn terriers are not a good mix. This breed doesn't have a lot of patience and has been known to bite. Children who are too young to know when to leave a dog alone do not mix well with this breed. No two Cairns are truly alike; each has distinct personality and character differences.","This is a cheerful, alert, lively and extrovert breed and makes ideal friends for older children as they can tolerate rough play and have great senses of humour. They will also get on with other dogs, although some will stand their ground. As with all terriers, the Cairn can be stubborn and independent and try to be the boss. This aspect of your dog’s temperament means that you need to show him that you are in charge. He is afraid of nothing and if he thinks he rules your home, he can get into trouble. Your Cairn terrier will often bark at the slightest sound. This is typical of terrier dog temperaments, and it can make him unpopular with your neighbors. You will need to train him to stop barking on command, and confine him when you aren’t there to keep an eye on him. He was bred to chase, so he has a very strong prey drive. He won’t be able to resist the opportunity to run after anything that looks like prey. You must be extremely cautious about letting your Cairn off leash, because he will go after anything that moves, and he will find it hard to come back when called. Most terrier breeds are remarkably similar. The same words are used over and over -- quick to bark, quick to chase, lively, bossy, feisty, scrappy, clever, independent, stubborn, persistent, impulsive, intense.","Scottish in ancestry, this small, sturdy terrier is in every way a game little dog. He is very natural, with a slightly shaggy, but not unkempt, appearance, and his double waterproof coat takes very little effort to look after. He has a particularly expressive head, which is set off by dark, sparkling eyes that give a good indication of his character. He has small prick ears and shaggy eyebrows and his expression can change from mischievousness to one of gentle devotion very quickly.","Cairns come in cream, wheaten, red, grey or nearly black","Cairn Terriers must be taught at an early age that they are not the rulers of the world. The toughness that makes them suited to killing vermin can frustrate you when you try to teach them anything. Cairn Terriers can be stubborn and dominant (they want to be the boss) and will make you prove that you can make them do things. You must show them, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say. Due to the Cairn’s traits of being stubborn and willful, training requires consistency, patience, and lots of treats. Discipline is wasted on the Cairn, as they will just stop listening to you all together. They must be trained early on to understand who is in charge of the house, given the chance a Cairn will see any opportunity to bend the rules, they'll take it and run with it. This breed generally wants to please their owner so getting them to do, as you require shouldn’t be too difficult.  However, establishing your role as the dominant member in the family is essential so that they then realise who is boss.  By undertaking training with a positive nature, this will rub off on your dog and make the process much easier.","Without regular brushing, combing, and trimming/clipping, Cairn Terriers become a matted mess. On the plus side, their shedding is on the low side of average.","The Cairn terrier is a long-lived breed with an average life expectancy of 13 to 14 years. Generally an extremely healthy breed.  However, like all dogs, there are some concerns that owners should be on the lookout for.  The first of these is ocular melanosis, an inherited problem related to this breed.  When it occurs, the production of pigment within the eyes increases and causes a build-up of fluid. Another of the common Cairn terrier health problems is craniomandibular osteopathy (CMO), a fairly common problem in terrier breeds.  It is found primarily in young, growing dogs and is identifiable by excess bone growth around the jaw and skull.  Other breed health concerns may include  allergies, cataracts, and liver disease.",not available,Families with older children Playful owners Loving Leaders Active,"Adventurous Tough Loyal Protective Inquisitive Bossy Playful Mischievous Is this Cairn Terrier for you?

Canaan,not available,"The Canaan Dog, the natural breed of Israel, dates back to Biblical times, originating in the Land of Canaan. The Canaan Dog was the guard and herd dog of the ancient Israelites, guarding their camps and flocks. In anticipation of Israel's War of Independence and WWII, Dr. Rudolphina Menzel recruited and trained more than 400 of the best dogs as mine detectors for the Middle East forces, and they proved superior to the mechanical detectors. On September 7, 1965, Ursula Berkowitz of Oxnard, California, imported the first four Canaan Dogs with the idea of establishing the breed in the United States. Dr. Rudolphina Menzel, who was asked by the Haganah (a Jewish self-defense organization) to develop a guard dog for the isolated Jewish settlements and supervise the aggrandizement of war dogs for Israel's approaching War of Independence, sought out the Canaan Dog. The breed proved highly intelligent and trainable and served as sentry dogs, messengers, Red Cross helpers, and land mine locators. In fact, during World War II, Menzel's dogs proved superior to the mechanical detectors. The Canaan Dog is the only breed that originated in Israel. 4000-year-old Middle-Eastern drawings depict dogs very similar to the Canaan Dog of today. Some scientists believe the dogs originally evolved from the wolves of the Middle East, adapting characteristics to help them survive better in desert conditions","A Canaan Dog is a wonderful, sensitive animal, often highly attuned to the moods of its humans. It is closer to the wild than most breeds, giving humans fascinating glimpses into their natural behaviour. This means we must be more careful and creative in our training methods than with some long- domesticated breeds. Because of their pariah dog ancestry, they need to be well socialized with many people and other dogs as puppies, or they will be loyal to their family but wary of other people and dogs. This is a versatile breed. While the Canaan Dog doesn't excel in any one particular area, he is smart and quick to learn, ready and willing to engage in almost any activity, from tracking to herding, obedience to agility. He draws the line only at jumping into a cold lake to retrieve a bird. Canaan Dogs are considered highly reactive, an excellent survival trait. Reacting quickly when confronted with something new and being cautious or suspicious in new situations can save a dog's life and are among the reasons the breed survived to the present day. Canaan breeders have worked to maintain the breed's character, so these traits are still present, making them excellent watchdogs. The breed is an excellent and vocal watchdog, so be prepared for some barking. Canaan’s are keenly alert and will notice anything new or any new person on their property.","The Canaan is described as alert, vigilant, devoted, and docile with his family.

Cardigan Welsh Corgi,Height: Male:10.5-12.5 inches (26.5 – 31.5 cm) Females: 10 – 13 inches (25 – 33 cm),"Cardigan Welsh Corgis are one of the oldest dog breeds in England. Originating in Wales, the Central European Celts brought them over in 1200 B.C. Welsh farmers later used them to herd and manage cattle, guard the farm and hunt vermin. They were also an integral part of the family. Often mistaken with Pembroke Welsh Corgis (as owned by the Queen) they are each recognised as their own breed. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is considered the older of the two. While more reserved with humans and other pets than the Pembroke Welsh Corgie, Cardigan Corgies are equally as loyal and eager to please. While the breed is rare, it is consistently gaining recognition and popularity.","These intelligent and courageous dogs have delightful and endearing personalities. They thrive on human companionship and are devoted to their families. They are brave and loyal defenders of their home and family. Their natural herding instincts make them a naturally protective breed and they will attempt to herd anything that moves. A farm or outdoor worker would benefit from having a Welsh Corgi. They are well suited to working outdoors and on farms but as long as they get enough attention and exercise they are equally as well suited to apartment living. In the house, they are quiet and polite.","They have endearing personalities and are incredibly affectionate. They are prized for their obedience, intelligence, and determination. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi can be wary with strangers and while they get along with non-canine pets they can be aggressive with other dogs. Caution must be taken when they are in defence mode.","Cardigan Welsh Corgis have fox- like heads and are small, sturdy, long and low. Their wide set, dark eyes and erect ears give them an alert and intelligent expression. The head is flat and wide between the ears. Their necks are long and they have deep chests and short legs. They are set low to the ground and are longer than they are tall. They have fox like, brush tails which almost touch the ground. The tail should not curl over the back. Their medium-length coats come in black, black and tan, blue merle, red, sable and brindle. The coat sometimes has white markings. Any colour is acceptable in the show ring, so long as white is not the dominant colour. The outer coat is harsh, straight and water resistant, while the under coat is soft and dense. The Cardigan sheds all year round with heavy bi-annual shedding.","Black, black & tan, blue merle, red, sable and brindle. White patches common. Any colour is acceptable in the show ring, as long as white is not the dominant colour.","Obedient and eager to please, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi will require basic obedience training and early socialisation as a puppy.  They love to learn and perform tricks and are often used as therapy dogs. Excelling in agility, herding trials, tracking and conformation they are also used extensively in search and rescue. They are easy to train but will take over the training session if given the opportunity.","Welsh Corgis should be handled with care because of their shape. Similarly to dachshunds they need to be held in a supportive way, if at all. Puppies will need to be taught how to go up and down stairs due to their short legs but it is advisable not to encourage stair climbing and jumping until the puppy is at least 6 months old. This breed requires minimal grooming but should be brushed regularly with a firm bristle brush. During their moderate shedding period they should be groomed daily. Bathing should only be done when really necessary using a mild shampoo. This breed has a tendency to become overweight, so they must not be over fed. This breed require s 40 to 60 minutes exercise a day. While they only have short legs they like to be kept active.","A healthy  Welsh Corgi Cardigan can live for 15 years. Cardigan Corgis are hardy little dogs, but some common health problems includes spinal ailments  and hip dysplasia. They must be watched when climbing stairs. It is advisable not to allow your puppy to climb stairs or jump until it is at least 6 months old.

Catalan sheep dog,Medium: Weight 35 – 45 lb (15.9 – 20.5 kg) Height: Male 19 – 22” (47 – 55 cm) Female 18 – 21” (45 – 53 cm),"The Catalan Sheepdog originates from the Andorra region of Spain and was originally bred for herding and guarding flocks. It is believed that the ancestor, the Bergamasco, of this dog and many other Sheepdogs across Europe dates back to the time of the Roman Empire and each breed was created by crossbreeding the Bergamasco with other local breeds. They have served as guard dogs and messengers in several wars including the Spanish Civil War and are also used as search and rescue dogs in their native Spain.","This breed is quiet but cheerful and very intelligent. They are happy, energetic and obedient to their master and loyal to their family. They can become very attached to their family and are devoted to their family and work. They are active and intelligent with a noble expression.","This courageous breed has been used for herding, as a watchdog and makes a great companion. They are an ‘all round dog’ and are gentle, cheerful and good with children and other animals. They are calm and well balanced and creates a strong bond with their family as they are very loving. They are alert and sometimes weary of strangers but make an excellent family dog.","The Catalan Sheepdog is not a bulky breed with an athletic and solid physique. They are hardy and well balanced. The head is strong and well proportioned and the muzzle is straight, short and blunt. The eyes are round and dark amber or chestnut in colour and they have an alert, intelligent expression. The ears are high set and hang close to the head. The neck is moderately short, solid and muscular while the shoulders are well laid back. The double, boned dew claws set low are characteristic of this breed. The tail is low set although some can be born tailless. Coat: The coat is long, limp and slightly curly with a shaggy look to it with a denser undercoat. They have full beards and moustaches. When the coat sheds, they usually lose hair from the back first which can give the impression of two coat types until the coat has entirely shed. There is a shorthaired variety but it is now so rarely seen it is thought to be almost extinct.","The coat comes in sable, fawn or grey with varying amounts of reddish brown, chestnut, black or white","The Catalan Sheepdog is an intelligent and trainable breed but early socialisation and training is a must to prevent shyness in this breed. They respond well to firm, positive and patient handling. This breed excels at dog sports such as agility, ‘doggy dancing’, competitive obedience and herding trials.","The coat is easy to maintain but does require a good daily brushing, particularly when shedding as the coat sheds oddly from the back which makes it appear to have two separate coats. Regular brushing during this period will help remove the loose fur. Their long beards and moustaches require regular cleaning.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 – 14 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is prone to Hip Displasia so it is recommended that puppies are hip tested before purchase. Exercise: This is an active and energetic breed which requires a moderate amount of exercise. They excel at all types of dog sports such as agility, competitive obedience and herding. This breed benefits from long walks and a good amount of physical and mental stimulation to keep them fit and healthy.","('Pastoral',)","Active, outdoorsy types Families with children Shepherds",Protective Intelligent Trainable Agile Cheerful
Cavachon,Small: Weight 12 – 18 lb (5.4 – 8.2 kg) Height 12 – 16” (30.5 – 40.6 cm),"The Cavachon is is cross-breed between the Cavalier King Charles and the Bichon Frise and is a very new hybrid breed which is not currently recognised by the AKC. They originated in the US with the first being bred in 1996. Due to it being a relatively new breed, proper breed standards are still being established but the Cavachon brings out the best qualities from a Cavalier King Charles like its sweet, gentle nature while adding a bouncy, playful attitude like that of a Bichon Frise. With these traits, good health and a powder puff coat, the Cavachon makes a great companion dog. They are typically referred to as ‘designer dogs’ and due to their low to non-shedding, are very popular with allergy sufferers.","The Cavachon has a friendly and loving nature which has made it a popular companion dog in recent years. They are intelligentand gentle while being very friendly and sociable. They have expressive eyes and a sporty appearance. Picking up on traits from the Bichon Frise, the Cavachon is lively, bouncy and playful","This breed is very affectionate and family orientated and as such, they do not do well if left along for long periods of time. They are not aggressive but are lively and alert. While they should not be depended on as a watchdog, they will alert the family by barking to the presence of visitors or strangers.They are happy to play with children and love the attention and get on well with other household pets they have been brought up with.","As this new breed is not fully recognised by the AKC and the breed is still developing, there is not a set breed standard yet but the Cavachon should be a good blending of the features of a Cavalier King Charles and Bichon Frise. Coat: The coat is fluffy, thick and curly. The undercoat is dense and soft while the outer coat is silky and soft. Despite their powder puff coat they are low to non-shedding.","The coat can be a wide range of colours with peach and white being most common. Other colours may include solid peach, black and tan, red, sable and white and tri-coloured. They can also have patches on the face as with the Cavalier and spotting can be common","The Cavachon is an intelligent breed which is eager to please and quick to learn. Early socialisation and obedience training are recommended but training must be done with firmness, fairness, patience and consistency. Crate training is the recommended method for training this breed and they may be difficult to housetrain.","The Cavachon requires regular grooming or professional clipping to keep its long coat looking neat. While this breed is a low to non-shedder, grooming and regular bathing is required to keep the coat in good condition. It is important to regularly check and clean the ears as well as keeping an eye on their dental hygiene to prevent tooth loss. The Cavachon can be prone to tear-staining on the face so it is important to keep the face clean. This breed is a light and sporadic eater which benefits from two small meals a day. Care should be taken to protect this breed from the cold.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. The Cavachon is a relatively healthy breed with few known ailments but some can suffer from excessive tearing which may affect their vision and they might need to have their tear ducts flushed out periodically by a vet. This breed can inherit health problems prevalent in both the Cavalier King Charles and Bichon Frise. While the Cavachon is healthier than its purebred parents, ensure that both parents are free from genetic health issues before getting a Cavachon as these health problems can be passed onto the puppy. They can be prone to ear infections, skin problems, sensitivity to flea bites, heart problems and hip dysplasis. Exercise: This breed is relatively active indoors but is well suited to both apartment and country living. The Cavachon enjoys play time off the lead in a securely fenced yard along with walks and taking part in family activities. This breed will do well in an apartment provided they are given sufficient exercise on a regular basis. This breed needs care taken to protect them from the cold so living outside is not recommended. The Cavachon likes a lot of exercise and play but is quite able to entertain themselves provided they can be part of family activities as they are very sociable.","('Crossbreeds are not recognised by the KC',)",Singles Families Retirees,Sociable Loving Family-orientated Affectionate and gentle
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel,Small: Weight Male 10 – 18 lb (5 – 8 kg) Female 10 – 18 lb (5 – 8 kg) Height Male 12 – 13” (30 – 33 cm) Female 12 – 13” (30 – 33 cm),"An elegant looking breed, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel’s history is rooted in royalty and aristocracy. Named after King Charles II, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a cross between the larger King Charles Spaniel and the Pug, creating a small spaniel with flatter muzzles, upturned faces, rounded heads and slightly protruding eyes. The toy spaniels were hugely popular in the United Kingdom in the 17th Century during the reign of Charles II, who adored his own Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. The dogs were often portrayed in paintings of the era, next to portraits of their royal owners. During the 1920s an American dog breeder called Roswell Eldridge travelled to England in an attempt to find the original breed of King Charles Spaniels with longer noses which had not been bred with pugs, but was mostly unsuccessful. He even offered prize money during Crufts Dog Show to anyone exhibiting a King Charles Spaniel which resembled those in the 17th Century paintings. The prize was won by a dog called Ann’s Son, owned by Mostyn Walker, though Eldridge sadly passed away just a month before the show. However, many enthusiastic breeders continued Eldridge’s work, and bred the King Charles Spaniel to be as similar to the original 17th Century breed as possible. In the 1940s, the dogs were classed as a different breed to the King Charles Spaniel and given the prefix ‘cavalier’ to differentiate between the two.","Your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel always seems to greet you with a smile! Happy, cheerful and bouncy, his tail is constantly wagging and he’s always happy to see you. This affectionate and loving dog is eager to please and wants to keep you happy, making him a wonderful companion dog. He loves to cuddle up to you and is an ideal pet for anyone looking for a lap dog who craves affection. Although your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is naturally well behaved and polite, it is important not to baby him or he could end up with Small Dog Syndrome. This occurs when small dogs are allowed to show dominant behaviour over their owners, which a larger dog could not get away with, such as jumping up on humans. It allows your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel to believe he is in charge of the ‘pack’, otherwise known as you and your family, and he can become bossy, aggressive, stressed or over protective. Always show your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel that you are the boss and the authority in the pack, to prevent this. While your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel makes a truly fantastic lap dog, he also has a sporting character which means he loves to get out in the open air and get some exercise. He loves to swim and excels in agility courses and field trials.","Your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was bred to live the life of royalty, so he’s best suited to a pampered and relaxed life that would be fit for a king. You can expect your Cavalier King Charles to be content to stay indoors being a couch potato and lazing around, just as long as he is close to you. Your Cavalier King Charles doesn’t like his own company much and would prefer to be among his human family, as well as with other dogs – he’s not suited to life as a kennel dog and will become stressed and unhappy if left on his own for long periods of time. Although your Cavalier King Charles is very much a lap dog that loves to laze around the home and snuggle up on the sofa with you, he does have an energetic side that needs attention. His hunting background means that he has a strong instinct to run and chase, so in order to keep your dog content and balanced you should be sure to take him on a daily walk or light jog. Your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel will do well with older children who can be more considerate to his feelings and needs, but he will not do as well with younger children who he has little patience for.","The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small dog, with a well-proportioned body and elegant posture. The rounded head features a conical muzzle with a shallow stop, black nose and teeth which meet in a scissor bite. The eyes are round and a dark brown colour. The ears are hanging, set high, long and show plenty of feathering. The long necks should meet sloping shoulders and straight forelegs. The tail may be docked by a third, but is often natural, and should not be carried too high. The coat is silky and medium to long and may have a slight wave with feathering on the ears, tail, legs and chest.","The King Charles Cavalier Spaniel’s coat comes in tri-colour called Prince Charles, a deep cred called Ruby, black and tan called King Charles, and red and white called Blenheim. Most breeders prefer the Blenheim shade with a chestnut red mark between the ears, on the top of the head.","Your Cavalier King Charles is not only enthusiastic and eager to please, he’s highly intelligent and loves to learn new things. This makes him a breeze to train with the right owner and proper guidance. Gentle, reward based training and positive reinforcement works wonders when training your cavalier King Charles Spaniel. They are so quick to learn that Cavalier King Charles Spaniels excel in hunting and agility as well as in competitive obedience, and they are also used as therapy dogs.","An average shedder, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel needs to be brushed with a firm bristle brush once a week in order to prevent mattes and knots from forming in the coat. The ears need to be brushed or combed more often than this, as they are particularly prone to becoming tangled. The insides of the ears should also be cleaned and the eyes regularly checked for any signs of infection. Bathe or dry shampoo your Cavalier King Charles when necessary, but be sure to thoroughly dry and warm him after you’ve given him a bath.","The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is susceptible to a number of genetic health problems including syringomyelia, eye disease and patella. Mitral Valve Disease is a serious issue which is a genetic heart problem that can cause premature death. Heart abnormalities can develop early in life with the Cavalier. It is incredibly important to know your puppy or dog’s medical history, going back several generations, so be sure to check this with your breeder. Other health issues include back problems, allergies, cataracts, diabetes, early onset deafness, hearing trouble and ear infections. As the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel enjoys a sedentary life as a lap dog, they can gain weight easily, which puts a further strain on their health. Exercise your dog and don’t over feed him to prevent excessive weight gain. The average lifespan of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is between nine and 14 years.","('Toy',)",Single people Couples Retirees and senior citizens Families with older children People who like long walks People who live in an apartment,Intelligent Loves to learn Lap dog Affectionate and loving Handsome and elegant
Cesky Terrier,Small: Weight Male 18 lb (8 kg) Female 15 .5 lb (7 kg) Height Male 12” (30.5 cm) Female 11” (28 cm),"Also referred to as the Bohemian terrier, the Cesky Terrier originates from the Czech Republic, where the breed was developed by geneticist Frantisek Horak in the 1930s. Horak bred the Scottish and Sealyham Terriers in order to produce the Cesky, as he wanted a terrier which would be capable of hunting in a pack in the forests of Bohemia, whilst also being a loving family pet and suitable show dog. It wasn’t until 1950 that his dream was realised and the first Cesky Terrier litter was born. In 1963 the Cesky Terrier was recognized for competition by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, and the breed is now recognised by all English speaking Kennel Clubs throughout the world.","Though the Cesky is less energetic than other terriers and has a calm nature, he still has plenty of stamina and enthusiasm. He’s been bred to hunt and will love a good chase, as his prey drive is fairly high. It’s important to allow your Cesky Terrier plenty of opportunities to run around, burn up his energy and be mentally as well as physically stimulated, so a daily walk is essential. Otherwise you may find yourself with a Cesky who is bored, which means he’ll be barking a lot and may become destructive in order to entertain himself. Your Cesky absolutely adores human companionship and thrives on your company, so you can expect him to be by your side at all times, staying completely devoted to you","Your Cesky is a very special kind of terrier as he was bred to be less aggressive than other terrier breeds. The result is a calm, relaxed and easy going terrier which is affectionate, loving and loyal. Your Cesky Terrier gets on well with people of all ages, making him a wonderful pet for families with children, and he’s also perfectly happy to be around other dogs. Cesky Terriers have a protective streak which makes them excellent watch and guard dogs, as they always want to be sure that you, your family and your home are completely safe. However, their instinct to protect can make them wary of strangers so it’s important to socialise your Cesky Terrier from an early age in order to avoid timidity around visitors.","A small dog, the Cesky Terrier is low set, strong and with a sturdy frame. The body is longer than it is tall. The Cesky Terrier has a distinctive long head with a slightly arched skull and slight stop, with the jaw forming a scissor bite. Viewed from above, the head should form a long triangular shape. The Cesky’s eyes should be medium sized, deep set and black or brown in blue-grey dogs and light brown in brown dogs. The nostrils should be black. The ears should be high set, triangular and hang low. The slightly arched neck shows loose skin at the throat and meets muscular shoulders. The forelegs are straight and the front feet larger than the back feet, which are all round and well padded. The tail is long and hangs with the tip slightly raised. The Cesky terrier has a single coat which is wavy and soft and features a bushy moustache, beard and eyebrows.","The Cesky Terrier’s coat comes in tones of grey-blue, with possible tan, grey, white or yellow markings, or a light coffee shade. Puppies are actually born a black colour which lightens within two years of age.","Your Cesky Terrier is intelligent and obedient, however he does have a strong stubborn side and a wilful streak which can make him difficult to train if training isn’t fun, consistent and rewarding. Socialisation and obedience training from an early age is recommended in order to get the best out of your Cesky Terrier. Be sure to use reward based training methods and positive reinforcement, or your Cesky may become uncooperative","Your Cesky Terrier’s silky, wavy coat sheds little to no hair, making the breed a good choice for those who suffer from allergies. The Cesky needs to be trimmed on a regular basis, around four to six times every year. The longer hair around the face, legs and body needs a comb or brush on a daily basis and the hair in the ears passages and between the paw pads should be clipped as and when necessary.","The Cesky Terrier is a hardy breed with no major hereditary illnesses and an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years. However, they are prone to a health problem called Scottie Cramp which, although the condition isn’t life threatening or painful, can restrict movement for your Cesky. The Cesky Terrier may also be prone to eye issues and back problems, due to their short legs and long backs. Your Cesky will be more prone to back trouble if he is overweight, so be sure to give him a healthy diet and plenty of exercise.","('Terrier',)",Families Retirees People who like walks People who like short jogs City folk,Calm and easy going Full of stamina Loyal companion Affectionate Occasionally stubborn
Chesapeake Bay Retriever,Large: Weight Male 65 – 80 lb (29 – 36 kg) Female 55 – 70 lb (25 – 32 kg) Height Male 23 – 26” (58 – 66 cm) Female 21 – 24” (53 – 61 cm),"Originating in the United States of America, the Chesapeake Bay Retriever can also be known as the Chessie or Chessy Dog. The story of the breed’s development dates back to 1807, when an English ship carrying two Newfoundlands was shipwrecked off the Maryland coast. All the passengers on the boat survived and the two dogs were given to a nearby family of dog lovers who had helped save the crew. They were then bred with retrievers, including the English Otter Hound, Curly Coated Retriever and Flat Coated Retriever. Careful breeding over generations resulted in the Chesapeake Bay Retriever we know and love today – a wonderful retrieving dog with plenty of stamina and a happy go lucky attitude. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever was used to retrieve birds form icy cold waters and its enthusiastic nature meant it could retrieve hundreds of birds in just one day. Their oily coat is resistant to water, helping him be an excellent hunter on both land and water.","Brave, loyal and affectionate, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers love their human families deeply and would do anything for them. They are excellent with children, showing patience and constraint while playing with them and having a protective nature which means they wouldn’t let anything bad happen to them. A natural hunter and retriever, your Chessy needs plenty of exercise to keep him mentally and physically stimulated. A nature lover through and through, he’ll be happiest living out in the countryside, where there is plenty of wildlife to run around after and lakes to go swimming in. Swimming is one of your Chesapeake Bay Retrievers most loved pastimes; they truly do have a passion for water. Be sure to integrate your Chesapeake Bay Retriever fully with the family; he loves to be close to you and thrives on human companionship. If he feels as though he’s not getting enough attention, he may well turn to destructive behaviour. He would rather have negative attention than none at all.","The Chesapeake Bay Retriever differs from most other retrievers in that it is fiercely protective of its family. While a Labrador loves everyone, including strangers, a Chessie is more reserved among strangers and wary of new visitors, although he will still be polite and well-mannered among guests. They make excellent guard and watch dogs, as they are alert and put keeping their family safe and sound at the top of their priorities. With an independent streak, your Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a dominant dog and therefore not well suited to first time dog owners. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever needs a handler who is confident, experienced, consistent, firm and fair. Without proper leadership they can not only be a handful and difficult to train, but can show unwanted behaviours such as over protectiveness and aggression.","The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is strong, muscular and powerful. They have well-built frames which attribute to their endurance and stamina. The head is broad with a medium length muzzle which is about the same length as the skull. The eyes are wide set and either a pale yellow or amber colour. The ears are small, high set and hang down loosely. The thin lips conceal a jaw which meets in a scissor or level bite. The tail is thick and heavy at the base and medium in length. The neck is muscular and the chest deep. Sturdy legs lead to webbed feet, which aid the Chesapeake Bay Retriever in swimming. The coat is short and dense with a slight wave and an oily, water resistant coating which repels water and helps the coat dry quickly.","The Chesapeake Bay Retriever’s coat most often comes in dark brown or dark red, but also tan and sedge. There may be white patches on the chest, belly or feet.","Your Chesapeake Bay Retriever can be a little bit slow on the uptake which means that training isn’t always easy. However, they are wonderfully enthusiastic dogs that are willing to please, so with a little bit of extra time and a whole lot of patience, you can train your Chesapeake Bay Retriever to be a well-mannered and obedient pet. Early socialisation and obedience training is vital in order to raise your Chessy to be well adjusted and friendly with other dogs, people and animals. The Chesapeake Bay Retriever shows huge talent in tracking, hunting, field trials and competitive obedience. An experienced, confident and respectful owner who uses reward based, positive reinforcement will get the most out of a Chesapeake Bay Retriever during training.","An average shedder, your Chesapeake Bay Retriever’s dense, oily coat is fairly low maintenance. A regular, weekly brush with a firm bristle brush will remove dead hair and prevent matting from occurring. However, the coat does have a distinctive smell and your Chesapeake will therefore need the occasional bath to keep him smelling fresh. However, over bathing can strip the oils from the coat and damage it, so be careful not to give your Chesapeake too many baths.","The Chesapeake Bay Retriever is a generally hardy breed with few known major health issues. They are, however, susceptible to hip and elbow dysplasia and eye problems including cataracts and Progressive retinal Atrophy.

Chihuahua,not available,"It has generally become accepted that Chi’s come from Chihuahua State in Mexico. The most common theory is that they were companion dogs of the Toltec civilisation, though no remains have been found earlier than the 9th Century. Some historians believe they come from the Mediterranean island of Malta, due to European paintings which depict small dogs that closely resemble the Chihuahua. Part of a Botticelli fresco in the Sistine Chapel depicting the Trials of Moses shows a young boy holding a small white dog that looks just like a Chi. The painting was finished ten years before Columbus returned from the New World. The case remains open! The Chihuahua was first recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1904, and has remained a popular pet ever since. Officially the world’s smallest dog, the modern Chihuahua is much smaller than his ancestors, possibly because of crossing with Chinese miniaturised breeds, such as the Chinese Crested Dog, by the Spanish.","Highly intelligent, your little Chi is very trainable, but not 100% obedient. He is feisty and bold and will take on much larger dogs in the park, so it is wise to avoid them unless you can train your Chi to accept them. He can be extremely possessive, so he may be unwilling to share your attentions with other pets. For the same reason, he is not an ideal pet in a home where there are small children. Fiercely protective, he makes an excellent watch dog and guard dog, as you can train him to protect your home while you are out. Unlike many small breeds, your Chi is not yappy, but will bark when he thinks you need to pay attention to either himself or the stranger at the front door. Your devoted Chi will be your shadow, so keep your eyes open so that you don’t trip over him or tread on him.","Your Chi is a true Latin in temperament, fiery and cocksure, but passionately loving.  He is loyal to the point of being a one-person dog, as many owners report, so he will need to be socialised from a young age.

The hindquarters should be muscular with well let down hocks. The feet should be small and dainty, neither hare- nor cat-like. The tail should be medium length and carried up and over the back (sickle tail). The short coat should be smooth and glossy with a soft undercoat.

chihuahua long coat,Small: Weight 2.2 – 6 lb (1– 2.7 kg) Height: 6 – 9” (15 – 23 cm),This breed originates from Mexico where it was named after the Mexican State of Chihuahua. It is believed its ancestors date back hundreds of years with images of Chihuahua type dogs being found on pots dating back to the 1300s and wheeled dog toys have been found dating back even further. The origins of the Chihuahua is unclear but it is thought they could have originated from the Fennec Fox. The Chihuahua was sacred to Pre-Columbian Indians and have been popular pets for the upper class. They are prized for their small size and most valued when they weigh under 2 lbs (1.3 kg). The breed was only brought to Europe towards the end of the 19th Century and was first recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1904.,"This breed is lively and intelligent, forming close bonds with their master. They are affectionate and curious, tending to form a bond with one or two people. They are weary of strangers and can appear nervous, yappy or even snappy which will need firm training to be discouraged. They require early socialisation to prevent them being anxious in new environments and to ensure they get along with other household pets and children. This breed is quite territorial and makes a good guard dog although they can bark excessively unless trained otherwise. They enjoy being part of the pack and are very adaptable to apartment dwelling. Due to their loving nature they make excellent companions for single people and the elderly.","This breed makes a good companion dog and is loving and affectionate. They are proud, curious and lively but can be strong willed without proper training. They form very close bonds with their owners and are very loyal but they require early socialisation to prevent them from being nervous of new situations and people. They have a tendency to develop Small Dog Syndrome where they believe they are leader of the pack so they require a firm owner to be the leader of the pack. Allowing this breed to jump up on laps and be dominant can lead to behavioural problems such as jealousy and aggression towards other dogs and humans.","The Chihuahua has a distinctive rounded ‘apple domed’ skull that can be with or without a molera (an unclosed section of skull). The muzzle is short. In dark coated dogs, the nose should be black while in light coated dogs the nose can be pink. The ears are large and flare out. The eyes are full, set well apart but slightly protrude. The eyes should be dark in dark coated dogs but can be ruby in lighter coated dogs. The head is held high and the neck slightly arched. The legs are straight with muscular hindquarters. The tail is either sickle shaped or loops over the back. The feet should be dainty with well divided toes. Coat: The coat is long and flat or slightly wavy with an undercoat. The ears are fringed, there is a substantial ruff around the neck and the legs are well feathered. Also comes in a short coated variety.","The coat comes in all colours and both solid and marked coats are accepted. Colours range from black, white, fawn, chestnut, sable, steel blue, black and tan and parti-colour.",This breed is intelligent and benefits from early training and socialisation. Some Chihuahua’s have been trained to use a cat litter tray while others are never house trained as they can be difficult to house train. They require a firm but patient handler and their owner must assert themselves as the master otherwise this breed can develop Small Dog Syndrome where they believe they are the leader of the pack which can lead to many behavioural problems. They can be nervous of other people but early socialisation can prevent this becoming a problem. They respond well to positive reinforcement and praise.,The long coat requires daily grooming with a soft bristle brush and bathe typically once a month taking care not to get water in their ears. Ensure the ears are checked and cleaned regularly and nails are trimmed. This breed is an average shedder. It is wise to brush the teeth daily as this breed can be prone to tartar build up.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is about 15 years or more. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is prone to rheumatism, slipped stifle, colds and gum problems. They can develop eye problems such as corneal dryness and secondary glaucoma due to their protruding eyes and have a tendency to gain weight easily. In puppyhood they can be susceptible to fractures and other injuries and some have a molera, an unclosed section of the skull which can remain open throughout their entire life which can be prone to injury. This breed may have a tendency to snore or wheeze due to their short muzzle and can be susceptible to stress due to their owners babying them. Exercise: These dogs are well suited to apartment life but are active little dogs and still require a daily walk. It can be tempting to carry them but dogs who are not taken out for regular walks can develop behavioural problems. Ensure they have access to a well secured yard to play in and keep them fit and healthy. This breed prefers warm weather and can catch a cold easily so try to keep them warm.","('Toy',)",Singles Apartment dwellers Families with older children Retirees,Curios Lively Intelligent Affectionate
Chihuahua smooth coat,Small: Weight Male 2 – 6 lb (1 – 3 kg) Female 2 – 6 lb (1 – 3 kg) Height Male 6 – 9” (15 – 23 cm) Female 6 – 9” (15 – 23 cm),"Native to Mexico, the Chihuahua is named after the town of Chihuahua which borders Texas and New Mexico. Experts believe that the breed evolved from a Techichi – a wild dog which was domesticated by the Toltecs in Mexico in the 9th Century. It has also been speculated that the Chihuahua Smooth Coat was developed from a cross between the Techichi and a hairless dog that was imported into North America from China. It is thought that the Chihuahua was prized by Aztec royalty as a pet and that they were sacred to pre-Columbian Indian nations. While the Chihuahua is thought to be the oldest breed of dog on the American continent, it wasn’t until the end of the nineteenth century that they entered Europe, when Mexican merchants began selling the small dogs to tourists.","Brave, fearless and adventurous; your Chihuahua may be little, but don’t underestimate him! He’s spritely, strong willed and incredibly lively. He has heaps of energy, so it’s important to make sure he gets out once a day for a good walk. Never assume that getting such a small dog means that you don’t need to be taking him for exercise every day. If you don’t walk your Chihuahua he won’t be mentally and physically stimulated and will become bored and a bored Chihuahua means plenty of yappy barking and snappy behaviour. A common behaviour trait in Chihuahuas is to be dog aggressive, though this usually occurs only when their owner is too meek and allows the Chihuahua to rule the household. As they can be snappy dogs when they aren’t given strong direction from their families, they are not recommended for families with children. This is because they will tend to show dominant behaviour over them. With the right owner and plenty of exercise, the Chihuahua is a loving and affectionate companion who loves nothing better than staying by your side.","Your Chihuahua will love you deeply and become completely and hopelessly devoted to you. This is a one-person dog that will only bond with one, or perhaps two, members of the family and will become extremely close to them, protecting them fiercely. Though your little Chihuahua has a gentle, sweet nature, he is wary of strangers and totally fearless, making him a fantastic watchdog. Expect your Chihuahua to always be at your side; he needs lots of attention bestowed upon him in order to keep him happy. Due to your Chihuahua’s adorable size, you may be tempted to baby him or let him get away with behaviour that a bigger dog would not be allowed to do. However, by doing things such as carrying your Chihuahua everywhere, letting him put his paws up on you when you get through the door or allowing him to jump up on other people, you are showing your Chihuahua that he is dominant over you. This leads to Small Dog Syndrome, where your Chihuahua will show behaviour problems such as aggression, over-protectiveness and jealousy. It is therefore incredibly important not to treat your dog differently to a large dog and to ensure he understands that he is a lower ranking member of the family pack.","Famous for their size, Chihuahuas are the smallest breed of dog in the world. With a body which is longer than it is tall, the Chihuahua is well muscled and flexible, making it an agile breed. Well rounded, apple shaped heads feature a short, slightly pointed muzzle, pointed and large, erect ears and small, round eyes which are dark or ruby in colour. The tail is sickle shaped and may curl over the back or to one side. Smooth coated Chihuahuas have a short, soft and glossy coat.","The smooth coated Chihuahua come in all colours, including black, chestnut, fawn, sand, silver, white, sable, black and tan, and steel blue. The coat colour can be solid, marked or splashed.","The Chihuahua can be a difficult breed to train and needs a lot of patience and consistency from their owners. They respond well to gentle, reward based training and positive reinforcement and will become stubborn and difficult to manage if harsher training methods are used. It is recommended that crate training be used for house training your Chihuahua. It is very important to start obedience training and socialisation with other dogs and people from a very early age.","An average shedder, the smooth coated Chihuahua requires the least amount of grooming of the Chihuahua coat types. Either brush the coat occasionally or wipe over it with a soft, damp cloth. Bathe your short coated Chihuahua once every month with a mild dog shampoo, but be very careful not to let water get into the ears as they are prone to ear infections. Check the ears on a regular basis and trim the nails when required. It is also important to ensure dental hygiene in your Chihuahua, in order to prevent tooth loss.","The Chihuahua is prone to a number of health problems. The protrusion of their eyes means that they can develop corneal dryness and glaucoma. Due to the relatively large size of the puppies’ heads, many Chihuahuas are born via caesarean section. During puppyhood, they are prone to broken bones and fractures due to the fragility of their bones. Some Chihuahuas are left with a molera – an unclosed section of the skull left from an undeveloped skull, which leaves a vulnerable, soft spot. Chihuahuas are also susceptible to rheumatism, slipped stifle, colds and gum problems. They may wheeze and snore due to their short muzzles. Though they are picky eaters, they gain weight easily and should be exercised regularly or their lifespan will be significantly reduced. Many Chihuahuas can become incredibly stressed, due to their owners babying them as they need to feel their owners are in charge of the pack, and this responsibility does not fall on him. Despite being prone to a number of health problems, the average lifespan of the Chihuahua is 15 to 17 years; the longest of any breed of dog, regardless of size.","('Toy',)",Singles Couples without children Apartment dwellers Senior citizens,Spirited Tiny Attention seekers Lovable Loyal Protective
Chinese Crested,Small: Weight Male 5 – 12 lb (2 – 5.5 kg) Female 5 – 10 lb (2 – 4.5 kg) Height Male 11 – 13” (28 – 33 cm) Female 9 – 12” (23 – 30 cm),"Originating from Africa, the Chinese Crested was originally known as the African Hairless Terrier and was treasured by sailors and Chinese merchants, who took the breed on board their trading ships to hunt vermin. The Chinese bred the dogs to be smaller and renamed them Chinese Crested and traded them throughout Central America, South America and Africa. It is thought that Native America Tribes, including the Aztecs, prized the Chinese Crested and used them as bed warmers, as well as for food. The Chinese Crested is often shown in rare breed shows in North America and Europe, where it less common. It was first exhibited in America in 1885, but due to the small number of Chinese Crested dogs and the lack of a national club, the American Kennel Club dropped their eligibility to be shown in 1965. It was some years later, in 1970, that the first breed club was established and it wasn’t until 1991 that the breed was officially recognised by the American Kennel Club.","An affectionate and loving breed that loves to play with and entertain his family, the Chinese Crested is a wonderful dog for families with children. Your Chinese Crested has an affinity with children which makes him the most popular of the hairless breeds, though still rare. If you want a friendly, charming and happy dog who knows its boundaries and respects your family, then the Chinese crested could well be for you. As well as being a wonderful pet for children, your Chinese Crested also gets on well with other pets. When he’s not following you around the house and keeping you company at every opportunity, your Chinese Crested loves to climb and dig holes. He’s adept at learning new tricks too, and picks up training very easily.","Your Chinese Crested makes the perfect family pet. Gentle yet playful, your Chinese Crested is a well-balanced dog that is incredibly intelligent and loves to learn new tricks. He’s completely devoted to his family and loves them deeply, wanting nothing more out of life than being close to his owners. Your Chinese Crested is prone to shyness and can become timid around strangers if allowed, so make sure that you socialise him well throughout both puppyhood and adulthood in order to have a well-adjusted, sociable Chinese Crested. Despite being a small dog, your Chinese Crested is not a yappy pup. In fact, he rarely barks or nips and is usually polite, clean and quiet.","There are two varieties of Chinese Crested, the hairless and the powder puff. The hairless variety is, as the name suggests, hairless, except for on its feet, head and tail. The powder puff is completely covered in a long, soft coat. Both hairless and powder puff Chinese crested can be born in the same litter. The Chinese Crested has a light, elegant frame with a sprightly gait. The head is wedge shaped and features a long muzzle with a slight stop, large erect ears and widely set, almond shaped eyes. The eyes and nose can be dark or light coloured depending on the shade of the coat. The tail is thin and tapered and hangs low.",The Chinese Crested skin and coat can come in any shade and can be solid mixed or spotted.,"Smart, alert and agile, your Chinese Crested loves to learn new tricks and excels in obedience training. His intelligence, teamed with his eagerness to please his owners, means that training is a cinch with your Chinese Crested. Your Chinese Crested responds well to positive reinforcement and reward based training, while severe or harsh training methods can make him stressed and hinder the training process. It is very important not to baby your Chinese crested as this can lead to Small Dog Syndrome, where your Chinese Crested believes he is in charge of the family and is the pack leader. This is very stressful for your Chinese Crested and can lead to many unwanted behaviours, including growling, snapping and guarding objects.","Your Chinese Crested is a very clean dog with virtually no odour. The powder puff variety needs daily brushing in order to keep its coat silky and matte free, and regular trimming will also be required. The hairless variety obviously needs very little brushing – simply a little around the head, feet and tail – however, skincare is needed. An occasional rub down with veterinarian recommended oil will prevent the skin becoming dry or irritated. It’s also important to apply sunscreen to your hairless Chinese Crested in order to prevent sunburn","The Chinese Crested is prone to a number of health issues, including tooth decay, hypothermia and skin irritations, the latter of which is particularly prevalent in the hairless Chinese Crested. The hairless variety is prone to sunburn, as well as tooth loss and decay due to having ancient type, forward pointing canine teeth called tusks. Many Chinese Crested are allergic to wool and lanolin. Each hairless dog carries one gene for hairless and one gene for hair, while two hairless genes are fatal. The Chinese Crested will over eat if given the chance and gains weight easily, so it is vital that he is not over fed as obesity will shorten their lifespan. The average Chinese Crested lives for 10 to 12 years.","('Toy',)",Retirees and senior citizens Couch potatoes City folk Families with children,Easy to train Entertaining Distinctive appearance Lovable Constant companion Intelligent
Chow Chow,Large: Weight Male 45 – 80 lb (20 – 36 kg) Female 45 – 70 lb (20 – 32 kg) Height Male 18 – 22” (46 – 56 cm) Female 17 – 20” (43 – 51 cm),"The Chow Chow originated over 2000 years ago, making it an ancient breed of dog. The oldest known fossils of dogs are very similar in appearance to Chow Chows and date back several million years. It is unclear whether the Chow Chow originates from Siberia or China. There are also some disputes between experts as to which breeds the Chow Chow is descended from, with some saying that they are a cross between the Tibetan Mastiff and Samoyed and others saying that the Samoyed is in fact descended from the Chow Chow. An all-purpose breed, the Chow Chow was bred for various types of work including hunting, herding, sledding, pulling carts and providing protection. It was treasured throughout Asia for its versatility in working, however in China it was also prized for its fur which was used to make coats, and for its meat. The Chow Chow is still considered a delicacy in parts of China today. It wasn’t until the late 1800s that Chow chows were introduced to the East, when they were brought to England by Chinese merchants and were called “Wild Dogs of China”. They became very popular in England after Queen Victoria took a Chow Chow as her pet.","Not for meek or timid owners, the Chow Chow can be stubborn, strong minded and wilful. They have a bossy and obstinate side which makes them highly dominant dogs, so a confident and experienced owner is best suited to the breed in order to keep their attitude in check. However, with the right owner, good training and intensive socialisation the Chow Chow is a loyal, patient and well-mannered pet that makes a wonderful companion. Their dominant nature means that they are not good pets for families with children or other pets, as they can be threatening if they believe these family members are below them in the pack. However, when raised with children from an early age and given strong training, they can be quite good with children and be very protective of them.","Your Chow Chow will tend to only bond with one member of the family and treat strangers with a high amount of suspicion. They are not sociable dogs and are always wary of meeting new people, so making sure that they are socialised from as an early an age as possible is highly recommended in order to prevent them becoming overprotective of you when around other people. The Chow Chow has a reputation as an aggressive dog and it is true that the breed is prone to aggressive behaviour problems, however this arises when their owner allows the Chow Chow to be the alpha of the family pack and rule the household. Your Chow Chow also likes to have space, especially from people he doesn’t know, and may snap at strangers who invade his space or handle him too much. Despite his serious temperament, with the right owner your Chow Chow loves to learn new tricks and can do so easily.","The Chow Chow is a very distinctive dog, with many breeders saying they look something like a cross between a lion and a bear. Their soft, full and puffy coat covers a broad, stocky and sturdy body. They have broad heads with a flat skull, wide, deep muzzles, and triangular ears. Their almond shaped eyes are dark and widely set and their teeth meet in a scissor bite. The Chow Chow has an unusual blue black tongue. They have deep, broad chests while the furry tail is highly set and carried close to the back. The Chow Chow’s coat is soft, fluffy and dense and can come in two varieties – smooth and rough. The hair around the neck is longer, forming a mane effect.","The Chow Chow’s coat commonly comes in black, blue, cream, cinnamon and red. Tan and grey Chow Chows have also been known, though they are much rarer.","Your Chow Chow is an intelligent dog who will respond well to training providing his owner is confident, has an air of authority and is consistent and firm. Be sure to teach your Chow Chow from a very early age that you are in charge and the boss, or they will try to take over and will become stubborn and difficult to train. They are a dominant breed and require a dominant owner. As your Chow Chow may become grouchy or even aggressive if treated harshly or severely, make sure that you use reward based, positive training methods","Chow Chows are seasonal heavy shedders and moult extensively during spring and autumn. Their thick, dense and fluffy coat needs brushing daily in order to maintain a lifted, puffed out look and prevent matting and knots. Only bathe or dry shampoo your Chow Chow when absolutely necessary. Because of your Chow Chow’s dense coat, he does not do well in warm climates and can be prone to heat stroke, so be sure to keep him cool when the weather is warm.","Chow Chows are prone to hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism and entropion, an eyelid abnormality which can be treated with surgery. They are also susceptible to stomach cancer. Minor health issues include ear infection, skin problems and allergies, and they have a low tolerance to anaesthesia. The average lifespan of a healthy Cho Chow is around 15 years.","('Utility',)",Single people Experienced dog owners Couples without children Households without other pets Confident owners with an air of authority,Stubborn and wilful Bossy Fluffy Loyal Protective
Clumber Spaniel,not available,"The Basset Hound, Alpine Spaniel and St. Bernard may have contributed to the ancestry of the Clumber spaniel. The Clumber's early history is not well documented and there is no proof, but some say it originated in 18th century France around 1768 by one of the dukes of Noailles. Threatened by the Revolution, he transferred his dogs to England, close to his family, the duke of Newcastle. Some say it is here that the Clumber was perfected and was successfully presented at its first show in the nineteenth century. It is said that several British monarchs have favoured the Clumber, including Prince Albert (Queen Victoria's consort), King Edward VII and his son, King George V. The name Clumber derives from the Duke of Newcastle's 3,800 acre estate Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire, England. The name Clumber itself most likely derives from the ancient name, ""Clun"" of a local river. Examples of vintage paintings depict white and orange dogs, which look like Clumbers with sometimes a little less bone and smaller heads being used for hunting expeditions. Though early standards and actual written descriptions mention a preference for the colour lemon. The Clumber spaniel is the heaviest of the Spaniels, and is a slow, quiet hunting dog able to work in both packs or alone.

Cockapoo,The size of the dog will vary depending on the size and breed of the Cocker Spaniel and Poodle used but on average these are the height and weight of a Cockapoo. Small: Weight 12 – 24 lb (5.4 – 11 kg) Height 10 – 15” (25 – 38 cm),"Cockapoos are cross breeds, bred from pure bred Cocker Spaniels and pure bred Poodles and it is believed that they originated in America in the 1950s. It is thought that they have been in the UK for the last ten to fifteen years. The Cockapoo is known as  the very first ‘designer dog’. Usually American Cocker Spaniels are used to create a Cockapoo but some are created using a Poodle and English Cocker Spaniel which is often called a Spoodle. There have been efforts in the last decade to separate Cockapoos and Spoodles of which there has been some success. The Cockapoo has been bred solely as a companion dog and as such, there is no breed standard with the focus being on creating a healthy, hypoallergenic dog with a good temperament. Over the years, the popularity of this breed has steadily increased. While not recognised by any purebred associations, unaffiliated clubs have been formed for the Cockapoo. The Cockapoo Club of America formed in 1999 and created a breed standard to encourage consistency within the breed. They promote multigenerational breeding of Cockapoos to maintain desired qualities not always seen in first-generation dogs. The American Cockapoo Club was formed in 2004 and created their own breed standard. These members do not mix generations or breed Cockapoos back with Poodles or Cocker Spaniels. There is also the North American Cockapoo Registry working to make the Cockapoo into a viable breed. The registry, formed in 1999 certifies Cockapoos that are a result of first through to sixth generation breedings.","The Cockapoo is intelligent and easy to pleased with an outgoing and friendly nature. This breed is very happy and gets along with everyone. They have the intelligence and spirit of the Poodle combined with the sweet and affectionate ways of the Cocker Spaniel. The Cockapoo is loyal, affectionate and very sociable. They thrive on human attention.","This breed is friendly and easy to please making it a good companion dog. They are lively and outgoing and generally good with children and other animals. They are affectionate and have a very sweet disposition. However, due to the parentage, this breed can have problems with aggression if not dealt with at a young age. This breed can suffer separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time.","As this new breed is not fully recognised by the AKC and the breed is still developing, there is not a set breed standard yet but the Cockapoo should have a good temperament and good health while maintaining the intelligence of a Poodle and sturdiness of the Cocker Spaniel. Coat: The Cockapoo is a low-shedding breed and hypoallergenic, often favoured by allergy sufferers. The coat can vary between very curly like a poodle or loose and wavy.","The coat can vary in a wide range of colours such as black, tan, beige, red, apricot, brown varying from light to dark, sable with black shading, cream, white, silver, brindle, phantom. The Cockapoo can be affected by the greying gene carried by the Poodle which means that a black coated Cockapoo may turn silver as they mature.","The Cockapoo is a very intelligent breed that is easy to train and eager to learn. They learn very quickly and benefit from early socialisation and obedience training. Due to the mix of Poodle and Cocker Spaniel, this breed can become aggressive if not given proper training and requires a firm but fair and consistent trainer.","Despite being a low-shedder, this breed does require a good daily brush. The coat is not usually clipped but if you do decide to clip the coat, it should only be trimmed to two to three inches in length. Hair around the eyes should be trimmed to allow visibility. Bathe only when necessary. The ears should be checked and cleaned on a regular basis to prevent infection.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 13 and 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. Being a crossbreed means that the Cockapoo is generally a healthy breed that doesn’t suffer many ailments but be aware of possible diseases or ailments inherited from the parents so ensure the parentage is free of genetic problems when buying a puppy. Both the Poodle and Cocker Spaniel can suffer Patella Luxation which can be passed on so be sure to get the dog check. Both parent breeds can also suffer Progressive Retinal Atrophy alongside other eye disorders so the parents should be tested before breeding. The Cockapoo can also be subject to ear infections so ensure to check and clean the ears regularly. Exercise: This breed requires a moderate amount of exercise and can do well in an apartment provided they have access to a sufficiently sized yard and regular walks. They thrive on human attention and do not like to be left alone for long periods of time as they can become destructive and bark excessively. They do enjoy lots of playtime with family. This breed has a tendency to overeat so a good amount of exercise will keep this breed fit and healthy. This breed prefers a cooler climate.","('Crossbreeds are not recognised by the KC',)",Singles Families with older considerate children Retirees Apartment dwellers,Intelligent Easy to please Outgoing Friendly
Cocker spaniel,not available,"Cocker Spaniels are been around for many hundreds of years, though until the mid 19th Century, Cocker and Springer Spaniels were considered to be the same, and indeed, both types often emerged from the same litter. Both types were originally used for flushing and retrieving game from land and water, until eventually a smaller Spaniel was developed which specialised in flushing Woodcock from English Woodland, hence the name “Cocker”. First registered with the Kennel Club in 1892, nowadays, there are two main types of so called English (the term is used simply to differentiate this type from the American Cocker, which looks slightly different) Cocker Spaniel, the Field or Working Cocker, and the heavier, larger Show Cocker.","Intelligent and alert, your Cocker is always busy, with a merry attitude to life and a constantly wagging tail. Easy to train, your Cocker is eager to please you, and likes nothing better than to be out and about with you, though he can be stubborn and “go his own way” on a walk. The whole of a Cockers being is about using that wonderful scenting ability to flush out small game from wherever he happens to be – in the garden or out among the hedgerows. If he isn’t hunting, and you’re at home, his retrieving instinct will show up in the gifts he brings you, a favourite toy, or one of your slippers. The more you work or play with your Cocker, the happier and more content he will be, because that active brain is easily bored, and without enough to do, he can become morose or sour. Good with children and other pets (though he may go for cats which are not “his”), your Cocker makes a delightful, entertaining family pet.","Your Cocker is a gentle person, and very affectionate, often coming up to lay his chin on your knee to gaze adoringly into your eyes (could that sometimes be a tiny bit of cupboard love?) Your Cocker can be a fussy eater, but that won’t stop him twirling in circles and barking if he thinks there’s a treat in your hand. Cockers tend to make a special bond with just one individual in the family, although he will be sweet with everyone, including guests, and especially playful and protective with children. Your Cocker is obedient to commands and can learn lots of different ones, thoroughly enjoying the learning process. He can be excitable though, and won’t like being left along for more than a couple of hours. Your intelligent Cocker can appear to read your mind, and when you’re thinking about just flopping out on the sofa, he will often be there before you.","Your Cocker should look sturdy and sporting, well balanced and about as tall as he is long. The head should be finely chiselled, with a square muzzle and a distinct stop. The nostrils should be wide enough for good scenting. The eyes should be oval and full, though not prominent and ideally should be mid or dark brown, unless the coat is liver or liver and white, when hazel eyes harmonise with the colouring. The expression should be gentle but wide awake, bright and merry. The neck should be of moderate length leading to sloping shoulders, and sturdy legs short enough for concentrated bursts of power, but not too short to interfere with speed. The body should be strong and compact with a well developed chest, deep brisket and well sprung ribs. The loins should be short, wide and firm, the hindquarters well rounded with legs that are short below the hock to allow for plenty of acceleration. The undocked tail should be of medium length (ideally no longer than the point of hock), well feathered and tapering. The feet should be firm, thickly padded and cat like. If your Cocker is from a working line, he will be lighter and slightly smaller than his Show Cocker cousin.","Here you are spoiled for choice. Solid colours include black, golden, red, liver, black and tan, liver and tan, all with no white. Parti-colours can be black and white, orange and white, liver and white, lemon and white, all with or without ticking. Tricolours can be black, tan and white, or liver, white and tan. Then there are the roans: blue roan, orange roan, lemon roan, liver roan, blue roan and tan and finally liver roan and tan.","Your Cocker is highly intelligent, and is usually very obedient and kind. However, if he finds a good scent line, it could be a while before he decides to come back to you. On the whole though, the more you can teach him, the more he will enjoy it. Your Cocker is known to bark, especially as a warning, but training can help him discern when it’s ok to bark and when it isn’t.","Like it or not, your Cocker will need grooming every day because that fine feathered coat is a magnet for burrs, twigs and thorns. You will also need to pay special attention to his ears and keep them tidy and clean, as they are prone to infection. Make sure you dry them thoroughly after swimming or bathing. A couple of visits year to the grooming parlour for stripping, which will include removing the excess hair from the insides of the ears, is recommended to keep your Cocker comfortable and smelling gorgeous.","There is no reason why your healthy Cocker shouldn’t live well beyond 12. Many make it to 14 or 15, but it is important not to let him put on weight or you will find signs of aging can start from as young as eight or nine.  Inflammation of the ear (Otitis Externa) is common as with all long eared breeds. Some suffer from degenerative eye diseases which tend to be hereditary. Cockers are naturally robust however, and will more than likely remain your merry little funster all his long life.","('Gundog Size: Medium: Male Height 15 – 16” (39 – 41 cms)\xa0 Female 15 – 115 ½ ” (38 – 39 cms) Weight 28 – 32 lb (13 – 14 ½ kg) Popularity: The Cocker Spaniel has remained the 2nd favourite dog in the UK for many years.

Coton de Tulear,Small: Weight 8.8 – 13.2 lb (4 – 6 kg) Female 7.7 – 11 lb (3.5 – 5 kg) Height: Male 10 – 12” (25 – 30 cm)  Female 9 – 11” (22 – 27 cm),"The Coton de Tulear originates from the island of Madagascar and is their national dog. It is believed the ancestors of this breed were brought to the island in the 16th or 17th century on pirate ships. The breed is named after the port of Tulear in Madagascar and after its cotton like coat and is linked closely with the Bichon Tenerife and Tenerife Terriers. This breed has always been a companion dog and was once the companion dog of the Merina, a tribe in Madagascar. They were favoured by Madagascan royalty, often known as the ‘Royal Dog of Madagascar’ – a term coined by a Dr Robert Jay Russell who discovered the breed and brought the first ones to America in 1973. Although they were occasionally imported into France, they were not officially imported into Europe until the 1970s. In 1970 the Coton de Tulear was recognised by the Societe Centrale Canine (French national kennel club) and the breed standard was published in 1972.  In American, the Coton de Tulear Club of America was formed in 1976 by Dr Robert Jay Russell with a separate breed standard he developed. Although the American Kennel Club has offered Foundation Stock Service to the breed, the Coton de Tulear Club of America is opposed to the AKC breed recognition. This has resulted in many Coton de Tulear clubs being formed which accept one or both breed standards.","The Coton is friendly and very sociable and a typical Bichon-type dog. They are gentle and affectionate and get on well with children, other animals and dogs but are very attached to their family and want to be included in daily activities. They are eager to please, alert and make good watchdogs. They learn quickly and enjoy walking on their hind legs and doing other tricks to please their owner. Without proper leadership this breed can become stubborn so be sure to establish yourself as a firm and consistent pack leader to prevent Small Dog Syndrome, where the dog believes it is leader of the pack as this can lead to behavioural problems.","This breed is playful, affectionate and intelligent. They are usually quiet but can become quite vocal when excited and playing. The Coton has a habit of walking on its hind legs to please people. This breed is curious and friendly, and they enjoy meeting new people. Due to their intelligence, they are easy to train and eager to please their owner. They have a friendly nature which makes them great with children and other animals. They enjoy swimming, running and playing and has a big personality like a Labrador. They are extremely adaptable to their environment and typically comes alive in the evening.","The coat is cotton like in its appearance, hence the name of the breed “Coton de Tulear”. Its coat is fluffy and cotton like to the touch rather than silky. The coat length is medium to long and this breed does not shed, being considered hypoallergenic. Due to the fluffy, long coat, it can mat easily to regular grooming is required.","White is the preferred coat colour for this breed but generally the coat comes in three accepted colours – white (sometimes with tan markings), black and white or triclour. Some may also have tan or lemon colourings to their ears and body.","This is a lively and intelligent breed which is eager to learn and please its master. They enjoy dog sports such as agility and obedience training. Early socialisation and training is recommended for this breed and they respond best to a firm, patient and consistent handler.",This breed requires daily grooming to keep the coat free of mats. Excess hair between the pads of the feet and inside the inner ears should be removed. This breed typically does not have a “doggie smell” and do not usually need bathing more than one or twice a year. The Coton sheds little to no hair and is considered hypoallergenic.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 14 to 16 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. The Coton is a relatively healthy breed but can suffer from heart problems, liver shunts, back or eye problems although these are still relatively uncommon issues for the breed. The small gene pool for this breed is owing to its near extinction and as a result, the inbreeding can increase the chances of genetic abnormalities in the offspring. Exercise: This is a lively and active little breed that enjoys swimming and playing. They love being out in open spaces and are able to follow their master on horseback for many miles. This breed does well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience. They love being active and require a good daily walk. They can adapt well to apartment life provided they are sufficiently exercised. This breed has a tendency to come alive in the evenings.","('Toy',)",Singles Apartment dwellers Families with older children Retirees,Intelligent Affectionate Lively Playful
Curly Coated Retriever,not available,"Coated Retriever is one of the oldest retriever breeds, but not much is known about its origins. First appearing at an English dog show in the 19th century, the Curly Coated Retriever is believed to have derived from the ancient English Water Spaniel, the St. John's Newfoundland and the Poodle. The Curly Coated Retriever is an excellent hunting companion and gun dog, waterfowl retriever and upland game hunter, with a gentle mouth. They were often used to hunt duck and quail. The breed is pretty rare inside the USA but is more popular in Australia and New Zealand. The first exports to America were in 1907. The Curly Coated Retriever was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1924. This breed may take some effort to find. Some of the Curly's talents are hunting, tracking, retrieving, watchdog, guarding, agility, and competitive obedience","Curly-Coated Retrievers were born to frolic in the wild and help people. These highly intelligent creatures need lots of love, attention, fresh air and “tasks” to keep them mentally and physically healthy. These are bold, friendly, self-confident dogs who may appear aloof with strangers but will give years of loyalty and devotion to the immediate family. Curly-Coated Retrievers make an ideal partner for an active, outdoor-oriented person who also wants a loyal family companion. They are reasonably patient with children and will get along with other dogs and household animals. This breed loves to swim. They make good therapy dogs. They make good watch and even guard dogs if they see the family is threatened.","The Curly Coated Retriever is easy to get along with, loyal and eager to please. Be sure to thoroughly obedience train them starting from puppy-hood. They have been used in competitive obedience and agility, but are not as predictable as some other breeds. This is not a breed for everyone. They do not fully mature until they are about three years old and can be wilful with meek owners. Make sure you are the dogs firm, but confident, consistent pack leader to bring out the best in their temperament. Proper canine to human communication is essential. The Curly Coated Retriever is affectionate, loving, and excellent with children. The more mental and physical exercise you give them the calmer they will be. Socialize them well with people and other pets at an early age. Without proper balance in their life they can be reserved or timid with strangers.","The head should be wedge-shaped in both front and side profiles with a slight stop. The eyes should be oval-shaped, large but not prominent, dark brown in blacks and tones of brown to blend with the coat in the livers. The ears should be rather small and set slightly above the level of the eye, lying close to the head and covered with small curls. The nose should black in blacks and brown in livers. The jaws should be strong with a complete scissor bite. The medium length neck should be strong and slightly arched, free from throatiness and flow freely into well laid back, muscular shoulders. The forelegs should be straight with strong pasterns and set well under the body. The chest should be deep with well-sprung ribs and a strong and level top line, with a slight tuck up to the flanks. The hindquarters should be strong and muscular with well let down hocks. The feet should be round and tight with well-arched toes. The tail should be set level with the top line and reach approximately to the hock and carried straight on a level with the top line when moving. Dewclaws are usually removed. The water-resistant coat is very distinct coat with small, tight, curls that cover every part of the body accept for the forehead, face, front of forelegs, and feet. The coat protects the dog from brambles and icy waters. Coat colours come in black or liver. The coat may have a small white patch, but it is not desired in the show ring",Curly Coats are either solid black or solid liver,"Very intelligent dogs, Curly’s have a great learning ability. However, they do have minds of their own and therefore training must be a challenge and varied to keep them becoming bored and losing interest.","This breeds feeding requirements depends on the type and quality of food used. Care must be taken to avoid the possibility of Gastric Torsion (Bloat), which Curlies (like all large and deep chest dogs) are susceptible to. Grooming should be administered once a week. Its beautiful coat is fairly easy to groom and only require occasional bathing. Never use a brush or a comb on a Curly as this will flatten the curls. They do shed: dogs once a year, bitches after their seasons and it is at this time that a bath should be given to get rid of the dead hair. Thereafter wetting them once a week will encourage loose hair to drop off and tighten the curls. If the coat becomes too long, it can be trimmed with straight scissors. The Curly Coated Retriever is not recommended for apartment life. They do best with at least a large yard. An eager and tireless land and (especially) water retriever outdoors, but a calm companion in-doors. Curlies need to be part of the family and not left alone outside in the yard all day. The Curly Coated Retriever is a high-energy, but also very intelligent dog that needs a lot of exercise, both mental and physical. Preferably involving swimming and retrieving. They need to be taken on a daily basis for long brisk walk, or jog, where the dog is made to heel beside or behind the human holding the lead, as in a dog's mind the leader leads the way and that leader needs to be the humans.","Common health issues in the curly coated retriever are hip dysplasia and heart problems. Epilepsy has also occurred in the breed: purchasers should check with the breeder, whether there are any known cases in the breeding of the litter. Gastric Torsion (Bloat) can also be a problem (as with all deep chest breeds).

Dachshund,Medium: weight male & female 11 lbs (4.9kg.) Height male and female 5-7 inches (13-18 cm.),"The Dachshund can be traced back to 15th century Germany. Dachshunds—coming from the German dach, which means “badger,” and hund, meaning “dog”—were used widely as hunting dogs. Their short, sleek frames and incredible sense of smell allowed them to hunt above ground, below ground and track animals for days at a time. Various sizes were developed over the years and the breed has come to exhibit ""terrier"" characteristics. They’re versatile and courageous dogs known to take on prey as large as foxes. The most distant appearance of a Dachshund type dog has been spotted in ancient Egyptian and Mexican art. In addition, remains of a Dachshund type dog were discovered with shipwreck remnants in Italy, dating back to the 1st century AD. A most enchanting and richly traveled breed I’m sure you’d agree! Though, the gene pool really came into its fruition, when Dachshunds were exported to Great Britain with Prince Albert, populating Britain and America throughout the 19th century. The Dachshund was lawfully recognised by the American Kennel club in 1885.","These intelligent pups have bundles of potential if lead by an owner who knows whose boss. The breed can become lovingly attached to their family and usually one family member in particular. It’s recommended that firm, consistent training techniques be used to overcome the dog's natural tendency to dominate, whilst not incurring a sense of injustice. Unfairly treated, a dachshund will sulk at length. If partial to long trips you’re in luck because this breed travels well. Be warned though, they are instinctive diggers so any freshly gardened plants may be just collateral damage in the latest escape plan.","Hell hath no fury like a Dachshund scorned- without proper leadership from their owners they can be jealous, irritable, obstinate and very quick to bite. If you allow your little dog to take over your house, the dog will try his hardest to keep all of his humans in line. Such a heavy weight should not be placed on any dog's shoulders, especially one as sweet and as little as the Dachshund. You see these negative traits are not Dachshund traits at all, they’re small dog syndrome traits. Meaning, most owners treat their small dogs like babies, rather than giving them leadership. Rules stating what they are, and are not allowed to do, which all dogs instinctually crave. Dachshunds who do have human leadership along with daily walks are wonderful family companions, with an excellent temperament. However, they thrive with single people also. Very young children could lack the necessary patience and maturity required with Dachshunds. Though very loyal to their owners, Dachshunds can take time to warm up to other people. The benefit, however, is that their (sometimes) relentless barking at the sign of strangers makes them an extremely handy—and compact—guard dog. Dachshunds, will also be happy in an apartment (they are among the most popular city dogs), but require lots of play, interaction and regular walks to stay in physical and mental shape.","There are three types of Dachshunds: Standard, Miniature and Toy. Their coats come in three varieties: the short-haired, the wired-haired, and the long-haired. A Dachshund’s head should be long and tapered with the forehead showing a slight arch and blending, in an unbroken line to the bridge of the nose. Obliquely set, the eyes should be almond shaped. The nose and eye rims, as well as the lips should be black. High set, the ears are long and rounded at the tip. The jaws are powerful and the teeth should meet in a scissor bite. The Dachshund “look” is hard to miss: long backed, short-legged dog of diminutive height. While small, the Dachshund is still muscular and powerfully built with a deep, broad chest and well-developed forelegs. The base of the neck slopes down to a protruding chest and a tighter abdomen.","Their colours can vary but most dachshunds are black with tan markings or a solid reddish-brown colour. However, they can appear as reds, dappled, with tiger markings, or brindle. Some may have a limited amount of white on the chest. Bi-colour dachshunds may be black and tan, black and cream, chocolate and tan, chocolate and cream, blue and tan, or blue and cream. If dappling occurs in the eye, one or both eyes may be blue. There have been genetic defects attributed to double dapple breeding.",This breed is intelligent but not particularly easy to train since it has a curious nature and a mind of its own. It can be very difficult to overcome the hunting instinct and train the dog to come when called. Early socialisation is required in order for it to learn to get along with cats and other dogs. Socialisation will also help it overcome its natural wariness with strangers.,"The Dachshund can be fed dry or wet food once or twice a day. They can be greedy so be very careful to not overfeed as an overweight Dachshund is at much greater risk of back problems and other issues. Long-haired require daily combing and brushings; wire-haired need professional trimming twice a year, and smooth-haired require regular rubdown with a damp cloth. If living in a place with a garden it must be very well fenced due to the above mentioned hunting instincts. Bear in mind that Dachshunds were bred to 'go to ground' and can dig under many types of fencing. These are active dogs with surprising stamina; they need to be walked for 20-40 minutes daily. They will also enjoy sessions of play in the park or other safe open areas. Be careful, however, when pedestrians are about because Dachshunds are more likely to be stepped on than more visible dogs.","The most important health consideration with Dachshunds is their spinal problems. Due to the elongated nature of the body, the spine is prone to injury. Disc rupture, often leading to paralysis, is a common problem in Dachshunds. Stairs and jumping on and off furniture must be avoided. Surgical intervention can sometimes help with this ailment but many Dachshunds have to resort to carts to haul their hind limbs. They can also be prone to skin ailments such as bald patches and lack of skin pigmentation. In addition, they are typically susceptible to ‘acanthosis nigricans’ a skin disease which causes a dark, thickened area especially at armpit. They are also prone to ‘pattern alopeica’ (patterned baldness). If kept at a reasonable weight the dachshund can stay healthy and active to a good age and reach a lifespan of 9 - 15 years. The average litter size is 5 to 6 puppies, although it is not unheard of for a bitch to whelp as much as 12 puppies.","('Hound',)",Singles City Dwellers Families with older children Hunters and outdoorsy types,Clever and curious Tirelessly energetic Always up for a walk or a game Affectionate

Dalmatian,Medium: Weight 55 lb (25 kg) Height Male 22 – 24” (55 – 60 cm) Female 20 – 22” (50 – 55 cm),"Little is known about the origin of the Dalmation although they have been living in Europe, Asia and Africa for centuries and may be related to the Pointer. Dating back to ancient Egypt, they have been used as guard dogs, dogs of war, circus performers, bird dogs, retrievers and of course firehouse mascots. In 1700 a dog known as the Bengal pointer, similar to the Dalmatian, existed in England, calling into question the Dalmatians Yugoslavian origin. Some claim the Dalmatian is a Croatian breed. Efforts to have it recognized as a Croatian breed had been rejected, up until 1993, when the FCI did finally recognize the Croatian roots of the Dalmatian dog, although they continue to deny Croatia standard patronage rights over the breed. In the Middle Ages it was used as a hound. The breed gained popularity in the 1800s as a “coach dog”—their natural quickness, agility, protectiveness and affinity for horses made them perfectly suited for following horse-drawn carriages and guarding them when their owners went indoors. The American Kennel Club first registered them in 1888, and the Dalmatian Club of America was started seventeen years later.","Dalmations were bred to run under or alongside horse drawn carriages so they have a vast amount of stamina and energy and do not enjoy sitting around all day with nothing to do. They are dedicated and very happy, easygoing and playful. In order to be happy this breed requires strong leadership and human companionship and do not do well if left alone for long periods of time due to their tendency to dig and be destructive. They enjoy playing with children but if not given enough mental and physical exercise they can become highly strung and too excitable for small children. Without proper socialisation they can become timid. They get along well with other pets but can be aggressive towards strange dogs if they are not trained properly. They are intelligent and wilful if they sense a meek or passive owner. Half of the people who adopt a Dalmatian puppy do not keep them past the first year. Young Dalmatians are very energetic, and need a tremendous amount of leadership and exercise. If you give them what they instinctually need, daily walks where the dog is made to heel beside or behind the human, never in front of the person holding the lead, and very stern, but not harsh leadership they will make a wonderful pet and will calm down after a few years. People who keep them long enough to get past their active stage tend to be very pleased.","Provided they are well trained and socialised, Dalmations can be both gentle and gentlemanly with good manners and a quiet demeanour. They do have a boisterous side that stems from their incredible energy and stamina so for this reason they may not be the best pet around small children. They have good intentions and may excellent playmates for older children and have protective instincts making them good guard dogs. They like to wander and if allowed to roam can be gone for days exploring to feed their curiosity so ensure that your backyard is well secured to prevent them from escaping and keep them on the lead in public. They are willing and eager to please so are easy to train and benefit from excessive praise when they have done well. It is easy for them to learn both bad and good habits so be aware of their determination, particularly in dominant male dogs. Generally they are outgoing and friendly dogs, free from nervousness and aggression, although, if not carefully reared or disciplined as puppies can become hyper. They are dedicated, loyal and willing to please. They are mild mannered, affectionate dogs who enjoy human company but their strength and stamina can be challenging for some owners as they take around two years to settle down.","The Dalmation is lean, medium sized and well proportioned. Their muzzles are strong, eyes deeply set and their soft ears are set somewhat high. They have strong, arched necks, deep chests and level backs. Their tails extend out from their backs and curl up slightly without carrying over their backs, and they have long, well-muscled legs with round feet. Overall, Dalmatians have a dignified, powerful and alert posture with a steady gait. Their coats are short, dense and sleek.","The symmetrical coat is predominantly white with clearly defined round spots. The spots can be black or brown (liver) which are the preferred colors in the show ring, but can also be, lemon, dark blue, tri colored, brindled, solid white, or sable. Not all of these colors are accepted into the show ring, but they do occur in the breed. The more defined and well distributed the markings are, the more valued the dog is to the show ring. Puppies are born completely white and the spots develop later.","This breed does well with firm, consistent training and is trainable to a high level of obedience. They can be trained for defence and make good watch or guard dogs.","The Dalmation sheds all year round but sheds more profusely twice a year. Frequent brushing will help to manage their constant shedding. They do not have a doggie odour and are very clean, even said to avoid puddles. Bathe only when necessary. They can be sensitive to the cold so don’t leave them outside in cold weather and ensure they have a jumper to wear for winter walks.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. Deafness is relatively high in this breed with about 10-12% being born deaf. They should be BAER tested for deafness at about six weeks old and totally deaf puppies should be spayed or neutered as the breeding of deaf puppies should be avoided although it is possible to raise a well adjusted deaf dog. This breed is prone to urinary stones and are prone to skin allergies such as synthetic fibres in carpets and upholstery. Exercise: This breed is not well suited to apartment dwelling unless it can be taken out for a brisk walk or run several times a day. They are very active indoors and do best with an average sized yard provided it is securely fenced as they have a tendency to wander. They are not suited to living outside in cold climates. They are energetic and have enormous stamina so they need plenty of opportunities to run off the lead in a safe area. This breed can become destructive and develop behavioural problems if they are not given enough physical and mental exercise.","('Utility Breed Classification: Dalmatians belong to the Utility group and, due to the publication in 1956 of the book 101 Dalmations, have become very popular pets and show dogs.',)",Singles Active people Families with older children Firemen,Dependable Tough Energetic Sociable
Dandie Dinmont Terrier,Small: Weight 18 – 24 lb (8 – 11 kg) Height: 8 – 11” (20 – 28 cm),"The breed originates from the border area between Scotland and England and dates back to the early 1700s when they were used for hunting badgers and otters. It is believed the dogs may have been a type of Border Terrier or a cross between Scotch Terriers and Skye Terriers. The breed was relatively unknown until they were written about in Sir Walter Scott’s 1814 novel ‘Guy Mannering’.  In the book, there was a character called Dandie Dinmont who owned several terriers called “Pepper” and “Mustard” after the coat colours. This character was based on a real life farmer, Mr James Davidson, who owned several terriers. Mr Davidson who spent time documenting his breeding is accepted as the father of the modern breed. By the mid-1800s the popularity of the breed had grown after Sir Walter Scott’s book and they became known as the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. Even today, they are the only dog breed to have been named after a fictional character. The Dandie Dinmont Terrier Club (DDTC) was formed in 1875 and is the third oldest dog breed club in the world. In 2006 the breed was placed on the list of Vulnerable Native Breeds by the Kennel Club. The number of puppy registrations reached a low when only 21 puppies were registered in 2003 but work has since been done to improve the registration numbers with 151 puppies being registered in 2010, the highest number of registrations in ten years.","This breed is affectionate and happy-go-lucky. They are intelligent but very independent and while they are good with older children, they should not be trusted with non-canine pets such as rabbits, hamsters and guinea pigs. They are lively, bold and brave little dogs and make good watch or guard dogs.","The Dandie Dinmont makes a great companion dog with the happy personality. They make excellent guard or watchdogs and are suitable for older children but should not be trusted with small household pets. This breed is tough and lively and can be prone to challenging other animals and sometimes dogs. They can get along well with cats provided they have been brought up with them from a puppy. This breed can develop Small Dog Syndrome if they are not given consistent training and will believe they are leader of the pack which can lead to behavioural problems including stubbornness, separation anxiety, guarding, dog aggressiveness and excessive barking. Provided they  are given consistent, firm training they make great companion dogs.","The Dandie Dinmont is a low and little dog, longer than they are tall. The head is large with a topknot in proportion to the body. The skull is broad, tapering towards the eyes and the muzzle is deep. The eyes are large, round and wide set and are dark hazel in colour. The ears are pendant shaped, set low and wide and hang close to the cheeks. The legs are short with the back legs being slightly longer than the front legs and the tail is curved and tapers to a point. Coat: The coat is a mixture of soft and harsh hair and is about 2 inches (5 cm) long. The hair on the underside is soft and the head has a very silky topknot. The colour of the sets usually by the time the dog is eight months old while the dog will continue to physically mature until it is about two years old.",The coat comes in pepper or mustard. Mustard puppies have a dark brown coat which lightens to shades of red when as they grow while pepper puppies are black and tan when born and turn silver as they grow. Pepper coats have a silver topknot while mustard coats have a cream topknot. Usually the legs and feet are darker in colour than the body,This breed is independent and wilful and can be stubborn to train. Early socialisation and training is a must for this breed. They require firm and consistent handling to prevent them developing Small Dog Syndrome where they believe they are leader of the pack.,This breed requires regular brushing with a professional groom to pluck/strip dead hair once or twice a year. This breed sheds little to no hair.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 – 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This is generally a healthy breed but due to their long body, this breed can suffer back issues particularly with slipped discs which can lead to a range of problems such as paralysis or loss of bladder and bowel control depending on the severity.  Some minor issues they can be prone to include glaucoma, epilepsy, hypothyroidism and Cushing’s syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in this breed, it is recommended by the breed clubs that they should have a gonioscopy conducted several times through their lives. This breed has a slightly higher risk of canine cancer. Exercise: This breed requires a good daily walk to keep them fit and healthy. They also benefit from playing in safe open areas and benefit from an average sizes, securely fenced yard. They do well in an apartment provided they are sufficiently exercised and are relatively inactive indoors. Take care when letting this breed off the lead as they have a tendency to chase small animals.","('Terrier',)",Singles Apartment dwellers Families with older children Retirees,Happy-go-lucky Affectionate Independent Bold and brave
Deerhound,not available,"The Scottish Deer-hound, or simply the Deerhound, is a breed of hound (a sight hound), once bred to hunt the Red Deer by coursing. The Scottish Deer hound has existed back to a time before recorded history. Its antecedents have been kept by the Scots and would have been used to help in providing part of their dietary requirements, namely from hoofed game (archaeological evidence supports this in the form of Roman pottery from around 1st Century AD found in Argyll which depicts the deer hunt using large rough hounds. These can be viewed at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh). Other evidence can be found on standing stones from around the 7th century AD. In outward appearance, the Scottish Deer hound is similar to the Greyhound, but larger and more heavily boned. However, Deerhounds have a number of characteristics that set them apart. While not as fast as a Greyhound on a smooth, firm surface, once the going gets rough or heavy they can outrun a Greyhound. The environment in which they worked, the cool, often wet, and hilly Scottish Highland Glens, contributed to the larger, rough-coated appearance of the breed. The Deerhound is closely related to the Irish wolfhound and was the main contributor to the recovery of that breed when it was re-created at the end of the 19th century. The Deerhound was bred to hunt Red Deer by “coursing”, and also “deer-stalking” until the end of the 19th century. With modern rifles and smaller deer-forests, slower tracking dogs were preferred to fast and far-running Deerhounds. In coursing deer, a single Deerhound or a pair was brought as close as possible to red deer, then released to run one of them down by speed, which if successful would happen within a few minutes - rarely were there sustained chases. With the eventual demise of the clan systems in Scotland, these hunting dogs became sporting animals for landowners and the nobility, but were also bred and hunted by common folk when feasible. As fast and silent hunters they made quick work of any game the size of a hare or larger and were highly regarded by nobility and poachers alike. One of the most precarious times in the breed’s history seems to have been towards the end of the nineteenth century, when many of the large Scottish estates were split into small estates for sporting purposes, and few then kept Deerhounds. The new fashion was for stalking and shooting, which required only a tracking dog to follow the wounded animal, using a collie or similar breed. Although a few estates still employed Deerhounds for their original work, the breed was left in the hands of a few enthusiasts who made them a show breed. In Australia, Deerhounds have been used to hunt the kangaroo and wild boar. In North America they were also used to hunt wolves.","The Deerhound is gentle and extremely friendly. The breed is famed for being docile and eager to please, with a bearing of gentle dignity. It is however a true sight-hound which has been selected for generations to pursue game; consequently, most Deerhounds will be eager to chase. City dwellers with conviction, however, can keep the dog both healthy and happy, as long as they are willing to take their Deerhounds to nearby parks for lengthy runs and rigorous fetching sessions within these wider running courses. Young Deerhounds can sometimes, depending on the individual, be quite destructive especially when they are not given sufficient exercise; however, the average adult Deerhound may want to spend most of the day stretched out on the floor or a couch sleeping. They do require a stimulus, preferably another Deerhound, and a large area to exercise properly and frequently. They are gentle and docile indoors and are generally good around company and children (however they require supervision with young children due to their size).","The mellow, nap-taking adult Deerhound starts life as a somewhat rambunctious puppy. They tend to test authority, so offer them firm but positive training at a young age. Scottish Deerhound puppies are not suitable for apartment life, but a fully-grown canine will suffice, especially if there are several comfy couches.","The Deerhound resembles a rough-coated Greyhound. It is however, larger in size and bone. Height of males from 30 to 32 inches (75-80cm) or more, weight 85 to 110 pounds (40-50kg); height of females from 28 inches (70cm) upwards, weight from 75 to 95 pounds (35-43kg). It is one of the tallest sight hounds, with a harsh 3-4 inch long coat and mane, somewhat softer beard and moustache, and softer hair on breast and belly. The coat should be shaggy but never woolly. The hair on the head, chest and stomach should be much softer than the hair on the body, neck and legs. The Deerhound should have a long head, broad at the ears and tapering to the eyes, the muzzle tapers to the nose. The jaws should be strong and have a complete scissor bite. The eyes should be full and dark in colour with a soft look. The ears should be high set, small in size, folded back and semi erect. The neck should be very strong and quite long. The chest should be deep but not too narrow. The front legs should straight, broad and flat, the back legs should be broad, long and powerful. The feet should be firm and well knuckled. The tail should be long, slightly curved and be well covered with hair. It should almost reach the ground but should never be carried above the back.","The harsh, wiry coat in modern dogs is only seen in self-coloured various shades of grey (blue-grey is preferred). Historically, Deerhounds also could be seen with true brindle, yellow, and red fawn coats, or combinations. 19th century Scottish paintings tend to indicate these colours were associated with a wire-haired coat, but, with show breeders preferring a longer coat, these genes now appear to be lost. A white chest and toes are allowed, and a slight white tip to the tail; a white blaze on the head or a white collar are not accepted. The eyes are dark, dark brown or hazel in colour.",The Deerhound is an intelligent dog that will learn quickly what is wanted and expected of it. They are obedient and eager to please and will acknowledge gentle and calm commands.,"To prevent bloat, feed the Deerhound smaller meals throughout the day as opposed to one big meal. Its complicated-looking coat is in fact easy to groom: Just trim it occasionally and brush it regularly. Scottish Deerhounds compete in conformation, lure coursing, for some states of the USA, in hare coursing and coyote hunting, where it is still legal. A few are trained to succeed in obedience competition but few excel in it, and fewer still excel in dog agility or flyball because the courses and activities are generally designed for smaller dogs with lower body weight and a much shorter stride. The Deerhound needs considerable exercise when young to develop properly and to maintain its health and condition. That does not mean it needs a large house to live in; however it should have regular access to free exercise in a fenced or otherwise ""safe"" area. Deerhounds should not be raised with access only to leash walking or a small yard, this would be detrimental to their health and development","The serious and common health issues include heart disease, some forms of cancer and bloat. Other possible concerns include gastric torsion, cardiomyopathy, osteosarcoma and hypothyroidism. Possible Health Concerns In general the Deerhound is a relatively healthy dog with ‘bloat’ being one of the main causes of death. It is important that as puppies they are fed the correct diet to ensure the bones and joints form properly thus preventing any future problems. Deerhounds can be expected to live an average of 10 to 13 years and generally has large litters, 8 being the average, although litters of 17 are not unheard of.","('Hound Size: Large Weight Male 85-110 lbs Female 75-95 lbs Height Male 30-32 inches Female 28 inches Popularity: The Deerhound is a member of the hound group.

By creating a watchdog and bodyguard who was muscular, fearless and courageous, he would have a protector that could deal with any situation at any given time. He was clever enough to cross the breeds of the old shorthaired shepherds for their loyalty and intelligence, German pinchers for their structure and stance, Rottweiler’s for their size and power, and the Manchester terrier for the coat and colourings.  Somewhere along the line he came about the Doberman, quite a specimen of a dog.","In the old days, and still in Germany, Dobermans that trained for police and soldier work were trained to only allow their handler to touch them. This has now evolved but a trait that when resurfaced can be noticeable. Loyalty and devotion are actually a combination of traits. The Doberman is a brazen defender of its home. If trained to stay beside his handler, he will do so. If the handler is wounded, he will drag him along or defend him to his death. The Doberman’s body is a gift he will happily throw up to block you from danger. The Doberman Pinscher is a dog bred for stressful and dangerous work at the side of a brave handler. For this work, the Doberman must have character and an impetuous but controlled spirit supported by a courageous heart. The Doberman is bred for a specific temperament. He is not vicious – he is aggressive. He is not stubborn – he is determined. Very energetic and a super keen breed, that does best when able to release all their energy. Can be kept in an apartment as they are very adaptable, but must be exposed to lots of open space often.","A working Doberman is also a watchdog and that trait is seen throughout litters. Anything new needs to be investigated. If the Doberman is unsure – he barks just in case. Lots of Doberman owners often comment about how their Doberman needs to know where all members of the family are at all times. They trot around the house every hour or so, checking each room. When the neighbors are in their back yard - that’s ok. But if they bring over a new friend – a Doberman will let you know someone new is in your territory. They are very in tune with the environment and notice the slightest sound, movement, or smell. Also watchful and aware, they investigate new sounds. They follow new smells. And if anything is questionable they let you know. This is one of the most valuable of dog traits, and is probably the reason man first started keeping dogs. With a dog such as a Doberman, you can find anything and no one can sneak up on you. Sureness is reliability, confidence, and bravery - but is sometimes referred to as strong-will or stubbornness. This is the element of the Doberman temperament that allows him to steadfast under command, obediently, regardless of fear, pain, or confusion. It also allows him to sit calmly, with his power latent in situations where it is not needed. A sure Doberman can walk past barking dogs with little more than an arrogant smirk. He will look to his handler for instruction on how to react to frightening sounds and sights.

The most common diseases found within this breeds specifications are as followed. Like in humans, cancer in dogs has a mysterious cause and if allowed to spread is deadly. To prevent cancer from spreading, it must be caught early. Many cancers in dogs form detectable lumps under the skin. Regular grooming and bathing often allows the Doberman owner to feel these lumps. A common cancer in the Doberman is bone cancer, which often forms detectable lumps on the shoulders or legs, or can be indicated by pain in the legs. Prostate cancer has a high occurrence in male Dobermans and for many years mammary cancer has been the number one killer of female Dobermans. Spayed female Dobermans has shown to reduce occurrence of this disease. Hip Dysplasia is a condition where the pelvic ball and socket joint does not fit together well because of a malformation in either or both parts. The loose fitting joint creates calcification as the dog ages, resulting in pain and lameness. This is seen rarely in this breed due to its size. Hip Dysplasia commonly affects many large breeds, but occurrence in the Doberman is rare. However, it is still important to test for this condition. One oddity on the list of Doberman illnesses is von Willebrand’s Disease. It is a genetic disease that in people and dogs causes a shortage of the protein von Willebrand factor. This protein is secreted from the inter walls of blood vessels when they are injured, and acts as a glue, holding platelets together. Simply, van Willebrand’s Disease can cause an excessive bleeding disorder. Wabbler Syndrome is caused by abnormalities in the spinal vertebra. A dog suffering from Wabbler Syndrome will lack coordination in the legs. The hind legs will usually stand crouching, not fully extended, with the feet far apart. The Doberman is one of the breeds with a high instance of Wabbler Syndrome. Also, Dobermans affected by this syndrome are commonly older than four years.

Dogue de Bordeaux,Height:  23-30 inches (58-75cm) Weight:  120-145 pounds (54.4-65.2kg),"There are numerous theories about the origin the Dogue de Bordeaux. It may be descended from the Bulldog, Tibetan Mastiff and from the Greek and Roman Molossus, from mastiffs brought to Europe by the Alans, from the dogs of Aquitaine or from Spanish dogs from Burgos. At the end of the middle ages, the dog was used as a cattle driver and personal bodyguard. Lots of Dogues died during the French Revolution. After the war numbers rose again. Raymond Triquet and his French Dogue de Bordeaux Club saved the breed. The Dogue de Bordeaux is now thoroughly established in France and gaining popularity in other countries. The breed has served as a war dog, flock guardian, cattle herder, guard dog, trained to bait bulls, bears, and jaguars, and a hunter of boars. The breed was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 2008.","On a typical day, you’ll find your Dogue snoozing on its favourite couch or bed. And it won’t be hard to locate: Just follow the snoring sounds. The Dogue may not be up for a big run in the park, but it does appreciate vigorous daily walks.   Though somewhat mellow and easygoing around the house, the Dogue can be very protective of its family and environment. It makes a very effective watchdog—often by just standing there—and knows when and how to adjust the intensity. The Dogue has a calm self-assurance in almost every situation. The Dogue de Bordeaux is gentle around its family, but needs plenty of socialization around other animals. It has a strong sense of independence—not to mention a loyalty to family—that will benefit from fine-tuning.","The Bordeaux has a good and calm temperament. It is extremely loyal, patient and devoted to his family. Fearless and confrontational with strangers, he is a first class watch and guard dog. They socialize very well with other animals, preferably starting from an early age to avoid them being aggressive with other dogs. The Dogue de Bordeaux snores and drools. Despite his fearsome appearance, the Dogue de Bordeaux is gentle with children and family members. However this is a powerful animal, and is not suitable for an inexperienced dog owner. The objective in training this dog is to achieve a pack leader status. It is a natural instinct for a dog to have an order in their pack. When we humans live with dogs, we become their pack. The entire pack cooperates under a single leader. Lines are clearly defined and rules are set. You and all other humans MUST be higher up in the order than the dog. That is the only way your relationship can be a success. This breed needs a calm, but firm owner who displays a natural authority over the dog. This breed, if male, should not be placed in a home with another male. A powerful breed, the Dogue De Bordeaux does well with children but should always be supervised. This breed must be socialized well at an early age to avoid any aggressive problems in the future. Overall, this dog is not for the inexperienced.","The Dogue de Bordeaux also called the French Mastiff and sometimes called the Bordeaux Bulldog is a relatively short, stocky mastiff. The wrinkled head is massive, heavy and broad. Males can have a head circumference of 27-30 inches (68-75cm). The muzzle is somewhat short (1/3 the total length of the head), wide, powerful and thick, with a pronounced stop. The nose is large with wide-open nostrils. Colour depends on the mask of the dog. The teeth meet in an under bite. The upper lips hang thickly down over the lower jaw. The thick skin on the neck is loose, forming a noticeable dewlap. The eyes are hazel to dark brown depending on the color of the dog and are set wide apart. The ears are small, hanging down, in proportion to the dog and are darker in colour. The tail is thick at the base tapering to a point. The chest is deep, broad reaching lower than the elbows. The legs are muscular. The coat is short and soft with loose fitting skin. Coat colours include various shades of fawn to mahogany with a darker red or black mask around and under the nose including the lips and eye rims. There are sometimes white markings on the chest and tips of the toes.","The Dogue de Bordeaux comes in a reddish brown with shades of fawn, from Mahogany to Isabella. Pigmentation is required. White patches on the chest and extremities of the limbs are acceptable","The Dogue De Bordeaux has average intelligence, yet is very loyal and obedient and eager to please his owner. Requires a dominant trainer to avoid any problems as this is a fearless, large, and courageous breed. Does well in obedience, working, and watch dog sports","The Dogue de Bordeaux is an average shedder, requiring little to no maintenance. To remove excess hair, brushing with a firm bristle brush would be a good idea, however a wipe down with a dry towel or damp washcloth should be sufficient. He requires little to no coat maintenance. The Dogue De Bordeaux requires quite a bit of exercise, and would do best with a relatively active owner. A large yard is suggested when considering this breed and long walks would do great. However, the short muzzle can cause this breed to tire out quickly so proper water should always be available.",". This breed will do okay in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised. They are very inactive indoors and will do okay without a yard. The healthy Dogue de Bordeaux can live as long as 10 year. In most cases, they produce a small litter size.","('Breed Group:\xa0Working Category: Mastiff',)",Families with older children Experienced dog handlers Couch potatoes,Affectionate Relaxed Protective Distinguished Courageous Patient
English Bulldog,not available,"The Bulldog, has been around for 600 years of recorded history, probably a lot longer. In the 17th Century, they were used in packs for bull-baiting, at a time when, although immensely strong, they were of a more athletic build, with a longer jaw with formidable gripping power. Bull baiting was banned in 1835, and from then on Bulldogs were bred to be gentler, heavier and more laid back. Often crossed with Pugs, they eventually developed the flat faced, pugnacious look we know today. Ultimately, they became very popular in the show ring as well as making excellent pets.","Sturdy and strong willed, your Bulldog is also naturally friendly, with a pack instinct that makes him easy to bond with. If you have space, two dogs of the opposite sex (spayed and neutered!) are ideal. Although they don’t need much exercise – two 30 minute walks are enough to stay slim and active – they love to meet with other dogs, especially other Bulldogs, because they are very playful. Despite his bulk, when excited, he is prone to sudden bursts of extraordinary speed for a dog of his build and will tear around like a mad thing. The pack instinct makes them easy to train, though they can try to dominate, especially when puppies, so a firm hand is needed to maintain the status quo. Your Bulldog will not like very hot or very cold weather. Somewhere in between is perfect, with a nice cold kitchen floor to flop on in summer. Because of his flat face, your Bulldog will tend to snort and snore, so perhaps he isn’t the ideal bedroom companion. However, give your Bulldog a lap to snooze on and a good cuddle, and he’ll be your friend for life.","Your Bulldog is a wonderful mixture of comic and lazybones. He is also reliable, loyal and obedient (except if upset, when he will show that stubborn streak.) He gets on happily with children and other pets. If you live in a flat, that’s fine by him, and if you don’t like going to the gym, nor does he. He likes nothing better than snuggling down to watch the afternoon film on a wet afternoon, and Sunday spent reading the newspapers is his idea of bliss. However, he will rush around and play with the children, as long as he has a nice lie down afterwards. He is a terrible guard dog because although he might put off an unwanted visitor with that pugilistic visage and bark a bit, he is actually a total pushover and would probably make friends with the burglar. His persistent nature will show up when he tries to get your attention. Subtle hints to go for a walk or have a game soon escalate into quite a performance and he won’t give up until you give in. Bulldogs love to chew, so to protect your slippers from being shredded, heavy duty toys are essential.","A good Bulldog should be short and stocky with a broad chest, and short, sturdy limbs. The flat, wrinkled face has a tough, intimidating expression. He should have a fairly wide head with cheeks that draw back behind the eyes so that when he pants he looks as if he is grinning. Deep folds of skin on the forehead lead to a short muzzle with another fold across it. These folds are known as “rope”. The nose should be broad and black. He has a hanging upper lip and an undershot lower jaw, though this should not be extreme.","The Bulldog’s coat is short and sleek, and comes in many colours, including chestnut (red), fawn, brindle (mixed brown and fawn, often striped) or any of the above with white. Many Bulldogs are pure white, but should still have a black nose.","Your Bulldog is perhaps not the brightest card in the pack, (actually coming second last in Stanley Coren’s book “The Intelligence of Dogs”) but is very biddable and likes to please. They are quite voice sensitive, so training is pretty easy, but it might take a little time for things to sink in permanently. Youthful exuberance can become annoying, so an early start to training is important. The only time his natural obedience deserts him is if he is very agitated, then he will need a firm hand and a strong arm to keep him in check. A determined Bulldog can pull like a small pony, so early lead training is essential.","Your Bulldog needs little grooming, about once a week is fine. However, those ropes, or skin folds on his face and nose do attract dirt and become moist from sweating, encouraging infection, so it’s important to keep them clean. A mild doggy disinfectant in water and a wipe with some cotton wool will do the trick. Sometimes the same needs to be done to the tail, if it is particularly tightly curled. A little ointment used here can help too. If this is done regularly, no problems should arise","Not a long lived breed, the lifespan of a healthy Bulldog is normally around 10 - 12 years, showing the first signs of age at around six. The most common clinical causes of death are cardiac problems and cancer. Hip dysplasia is quite common, especially in overweight dogs. Some suffer from luxating patellas, where the patella, or knee cap, keeps slipping in and out of place, but this is rare. Like all short faced breeds, Bulldogs are extremely sensitive to heat, and can easily suffer from hyperthermia, or overheating. On hot days, keep your Bulldog out of standing heat and provide as much shade as you can, with access to water. Bulldogs sweat mostly through their feet, so a cool floor is appreciated, and some may appreciate a shallow paddling pool in a shady spot in the garden. Bulldogs gain weight easily, causing breathing problems and heart failure. Something else you should know is that fat Bulldogs fart – so be warned! To keep the air fresh, keep the weight down! In 2009, the Kennel Club UK revised the breed standard. A smaller head, fewer skin folds, a longer muzzle and a taller, thinner frame is now considered desirable to combat breathing troubles and to aid easier births. Under the original standard, puppies were invariably produced by Caesarian Section, as the heads and shoulders of the pups were too big for the birth canal. So our dear Bulldog is not as tough as he looks, though if you buy from a reputable breeder, bearing in mind the new KC breed standard, your Bulldog should give you more than a decade of adoring, companionable, amusing fun.",not available,People who hate jogging People who prefer short walks Apartment dwellers Older couples Families,Wrinkly but gorgeous Fierce and tough looking Friendly Affectionate Playful Funny Laid back

It was developed by crossing the Italian Pointer, Foxhound, Bloodhound, Greyhound, Newfoundland, Setter and Bulldog and its name was derived from the way it stands motionless when it spots game as if it were pointing to it. Before guns became popular for hunting, Pointers were used to find hare for Greyhounds to hunt and by the early 1700s English Pointers were very popular among hunters as they are excellent at catching a scenting and pointing the hunter in the right direction. They are quick and can cover a lot of ground in short amount of time, often being used to flush out birds. They are not water dogs nor are they expected to retrieve the kill. They work well in warm weather but are not suited well to the cold. The English Pointer often wins Pointing Field Trials over all other pointing breeds and was first recognised by the AKC in 1884. The breed continues to thrive as a popular hunting dog and companion.","The English Pointer is very high energy and an enthusiastic hunter but can be calm in the home with enough exercise. They are intelligent, devoted, loyal and clean. They are patient, friendly, affection and love children, making a true family friend. They are adaptable but can be reserved with strangers so require early socialisation. Ensure you are strong and firm in training to avoid timidity in the dog as a nervous human can make the dog nervous. They can become highly strung, distractible, neurotic and destructive if they are not given enough physical and mental exercise. They will bark at suspicious noises but are not watchdogs. The hunting instinct develops early and puppies will start to develop pointing behaviour as young as eight weeks old. They are generally good with other pets and are not usually dog aggressive. They exhibit a proud and aristocratic demeanour","This breed is affectionate, loyal and devoted. They are responsive, congenial and even tempered. They get along well with other dogs and household pets that they have been raised with. They are also good with children but need to be supervised with small children. They are reserved with strangers and will alert the family to suspicious noises and activity.","The English Pointer has a lean, muscular, athletic frame covered in a sleek, shiny coat. Their clean-cut heads have long muzzles and jaw-length ears. They have round, alert eyes that come in varying shades of brown depending on the coat color. The stop is well-defined. The nose is black or brown in color in the darker coated dogs and may be lighter or flesh in the lighter dogs. The teeth should meet in a level or scissors bite. The hanging ears are somewhat pointed at the end. The front legs are straight. Their long necks slope down to narrow shoulders, strong backs and thick tails. Overall, English Pointers have a sporty yet elegant look. Coat: The coat is sleek, shiny, short and dense with a natural sheen.","The coat comes in liver, black, yellow or orange; either solid or with white patches.","This breed is easily distracted and wilful but are very intelligent. Early socialisation and training is very important but training sessions should be short and varied. They do not response to harsh or heavy handed training methods. Training should be done with firmness, fairness, patience and consistency","The English Pointer is easy to groom, requiring a regular brushing with a firm bristle brush and bathe only when necessary. Rubbing the coat with a piece of towelling or chamois will leave the coat gleaming. This breed is an average shedder. Ensure to check the feet for debris especially after the dog has been exercising or working and dry the dog thoroughly after hunting to prevent chilling. It is important to check the ears regularly for infection.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 13 and 14 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is prone to suffering hip dysplasia, skin allergies, thyroid problems, epilepsy and dwarfism. Exercise: As a classic sporting dog this breed has lots of energy. They need room to run, daily walks and constructive “tasks” to keep them mentally stimulated. They make good jogging companions and have stamina so you will tire out long before they do. This breed is not recommended for apartment life as they are moderately active indoors and do best with lots of room to roam. They are very energetic and tireless so it important they get daily vigorous exercise to prevent restlessness indoors. They benefit from being taken on a daily, brisk, long walk, jog or running alongside a bicycle. Some love to swim and retrieve although they were not bred for this task.  While out on the walk the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as instinct tells a dog the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human. Teach them to enter and exit door and gateways after the humans. When the dog is taught to work as a hunting dog it must be taught the difference between when it is time to work and when it is not. When it is not time to hunt the dog should be respectfully heeling on a leash for the handler.

It has been a much-loved bird dog since the first strains of setter were developed in France in 1500. Early setters were called ""Setting Spaniels"" named after the way the dogs would crouch down after finding the prey. They were brought to Great Britain in the early 1800s where Sir Edward Laverack developed them into the English Setters we know today – breeding out the trait of crouching to a sitting position, as hunters now had guns and this made them more easy to be seen. Renowned for their dependability and beauty, the English Setter’s talents include hunting, tracking, pointing, retrieving and agility. There are two types of English Setter including field lines and show lines (bench). Field types were bred for hunting and field trial work. They are smaller and lighter. The bench type are bred for conformation shows. They are popular show dogs.","The English has a gentle and endearing character. They are calm and friendly, good with children and very affectionate. They are active and exuberant outside but relaxed and fairly inactive indoors. English Setters love to dig and roam, and are good at jumping. They are very sensitive dogs who do not respond well to harsh training or discipline, but can be willful if they sense they are more strong minded than their owners. These dogs need structure and should be treated with an air of natural authority. An inexperienced owner, or one who is unsure they would be able to assert their authority should choose a more submissive pup. English Setters enjoy the company of other dogs.  They are energetic and need lots of daily exercise and mental stimulation. They can become nuisance barkers if they are bored. This breed makes a lovely companion.","English Setters do well in a family environment and are good with children. They are a mild mannered gentle breed, but can also make good watch dogs due to their love of barking. The English Setter loves attention and will demand as much of it as possible. They are very active and intelligent dogs and if they aren’t given enough fuss or mental stimulation, can become destructive and difficult. However this loving and endearing dog has a lovely nature and can make a wonderful companion if handled correctly. They should not be trusted around smaller more passive pets, but get along well with cats and dogs provided they have been properly socialized.","The English Setter is an elegant and beautiful working gundog. They are long and Lean, with silky, wavy hair. Their coats are flat and of a medium length. They are often speckled. The hair on the ears, underside, abdomen, chest and tail is feathered and soft. Show Setters have a longer heavier coat than the field breed. English Setters have large dark brown or hazel eyes. Their ears are set back and low and hang down. The skull in oval shaped. They have elegant necks and deep chests.","White with blue, lemon, orange, or brown markings.","The English Setter can be difficult to housebreak, but is eager to please their owners. Given proper handling, English Setters can learn quickly. Obedience classes at an early age are recommended. The English Setter does best with positive reinforcement. They should be corrected in a gentle manner as they are sensitive. Harsh punishment may destroy their temperament. They need authoritative and calm treatment.",The English Setter requires regular brushing to keep the coat in good shape. They shed very little. The feathering of the coat should be checked for burrs and knots. They shed very little and should be bathed only when necessary. The English Setter used for shows needs to be groomed two three times a week with long brushing sessions and regular cleaning of the coat. Dry shampooing is often used so the natural oils are not removed from the glossy coat.,"The lifespan of a healthy English Setter is 10 to 12 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, like most dogs there are complaints typical of the breed which may develop as they get older. This can include  canine deafness, Hypothyroidism and hip and elbow dysplasia.  It is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding. While your puppy is young, many of these joint problems can be avoided by exercising for short periods only. Avoid too much rushing around until the bones are strong enough to take more strenuous exercise. Be careful not to overfeed this breed, as they gain weight easily.

During the Renaissance, it was considered the ideal companion for the European hunter. In the late 1880s, Springer Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels often appeared in the same litters, and it was not until 1902 that they were classified as distinct breeds based on size (the Springer being larger) by the UK Kennel Club. The English Springer Spaniel was first registered by the AKC in 1927, and to this day English Springer Spaniels continue to be valued for their agility, hunting skills, obedience and companionship. The English Springer Spaniel is the founder of all the English hunting spaniels and is the largest of the Spaniel breeds. The Clumber, the Sussex, the Welsh Springer, the Field, the Irish Water, and the Cocker Spaniel have all developed out of the English Springer Spaniel. The English Springer Spaniel Field Trial Association was formed in 1924 and field trials were held for the first time. Their talents include hunting, tracking, retrieving, watchdog, agility, competitive obedience, and performing tricks. Currently, there are two distinct ""types"" of the English Springer Spaniel. Those bred for the conformation ring are referred to as ""bench bred"". Those that are bred for hunting and/or field trials are referred to as ""field bred"".","English Springer Spaniels love everybody, and everybody loves them. They are humble enough to adapt to child’s play, but they are secure enough to be comfortable around strangers and other pets. They are wonderful playmates for children and greet most strangers with an open heart. However, they have great protective instincts and will definitely sound the alarm if they sense a threat. Springers are people-orientated dogs. They need lots of attention, companionship and positive feedback to feel settled and centered. Left alone for too long, they can get bored and could start to dig up a garden, bark for no reason or chew on shoes.","English Springer Spaniels are sociable, gregarious, and gentle. They are also courageous, highly intelligent, and sincere. They are excellent with children and love everyone. The English Springer Spaniel thrives on human interaction and need lots of attention from their family. If they are left alone for extended periods of time they will become destructive and are prone to excessive barking. They are good with other pets, but may not tolerate same sex dogs. Due to their fowl hunting nature they are not suitable for homes with pet birds.","English Springer Spaniels are medium-sized dogs with compact bodies and medium-length coats that grow feathery on their long ears, legs, chest and belly. Their heads are strong without seeming heavy, and their faces have a chiseled shape that gives them a pleasant expression. Their eyes are medium-sized, oval-shaped and somewhat sunken, giving off a bright and loving expression. They have long necks (about the length of their heads) that slope down to deep, developed chests. Their tails are usually docked (note that docking tails is illegal in most parts of Europe), and their flat or wavy coats can come in black and white, liver and white, or blue or liver roan. Overall, English Springer Spaniels have a gallant, alert and sturdy look.","The coat can come in colours ranging from liver and white, black and white, predominantly white with black or liver markings, blue or liver roan, or a tricolor pattern of black and white or liver.","The English Springer Spaniel benefits from early intensive socialization and obedience. They must have firmness, fairness, praise, and consistency. This breed enjoys and excels in agility, flyball, tracking, retrieving, obedience, and, of course, hunting. They are also capable of making wonderful therapy dogs.",,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 14 years, which is normal for a dog of this size.  If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur.  Common health issues include hip dysplasia, epilepsy, kidney disease and eye problems such as progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and cataracts. Springers are prone to hip dysplasia so it is a good idea to get your puppy hip scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. Other problems can include patella luxation, where the kneecap slips in and out of place and blood disorder Phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFK).  This breed tends to gain weight easily and must not be overfed. The English Springer Spaniel has recently become afflicted with a serious personality disorder called ""Rage Syndrome"". A rare disorder, this syndrome will cause an otherwise normal dog to go into a sudden rage and viciously attack. Should this occur, the English Springer Spaniel will not respond to any commands. This condition has been found to be a form of epilepsy and is treatable. Exercise: Springers are energetic and require daily exercise. They enjoy brisk walks, bicycling, ball chasing, and swimming. They can adapt to city life and will do well in an apartment dwelling provided they are sufficiently exercised and given a safe space to run. They are relatively inactive indoors and will do best with at least an average-sized yard. They should have chances to take daily long walks or jog alongside the human, and they will also benefit from a run and play off the leash.

English Toy Terriers were in particularly large demand in England during the 1800’s due to their skills at catching rats. The advancement of the industrial revolution brought on an ever-increasing rat population and set in place the role of the breed as ‘ratters.’ Contests arose in specially designed rat pits, where betting would take place on how long it would take the fast and agile English Toy Terriers to kill their quota of rats. Small dogs were highly regarded, with the ultimate ideal being to produce the smallest dog still capable of killing its quota of rats in as short a time as possible.

Entlebucher Mountain Dog,Large: Weight 45 – 65 lb (20.4 – 29.5 kg) Height: 17 – 20” (44 – 52 cm),The Entlebucher is named after a town and region in the Swiss canton of Lucerne. It is the smallest of the four breeds of Swiss Mountain Dogs. It is believed to be descended from the fighting and guarding mastiffs brought to Switzerland by the Romans in the first century B.C. The Entlebucher was only described as a separate breed in 1889 though initially little distinction was made betweehnthe Entlebucher Sennenhund and the Appenzeller Sennenhund. The breed was saved from extinction by the efforts of Franz Schertenlieb and Professor Albert Heim who was an advocate for rare Sennenhund breeds. After WWI no examples of the breed were found until 1927 when sixteen were found and the breed was restored. The first breed club was formed in 1926. Originally this breed was used for guarding and herding but today the Entlebucher is a companion dog.,"This breed is good natured and devoted to its family. They are versatile, lively and active and extremely protective of their family. They are sociable and very much a people’s dog who like to be surrounded by activity and people.","This breed is intelligent and sociable although they can be reserved with strangers. They are lively, active and energetic as well as being self assured and determined – particularly when they are working. They do best when they have a job to do but they do make trusted companions and great family members. Their are faithful and loving towards their family as well as being quite protective of them.","The Entlebucher is sturdy, square, working dog. The ears are small and triangular and the eyes are small, brown and lively. The head is well proportioned and the skull is strong and flat. The jaw is long, well formed and powerful. The feet are compact and the body is muscular. The tail is sometimes docked which is prohibited in some countries or it may have a natural bobtail. Coat: The coat is smooth, close and harsh with symmetrical markings of black, tan and white.","The coat comes only in tricolour. The coat has white on its toes, tip of the tail, chest and blaze with tan always between the black and white markings.","This breed is alert and eager to please as well as being very intelligent. Early socialisation is required as they can be somewhat reserved with strangers. Early obedience training is recommended and the Entlebucher responds best to a firm, calm and consistent handler.",The Entlebucher has a smooth coat which is easily groomed and they benefit from regular brushing. This breed is an average shedder.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is about 11 to 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. Due to this breed’s rarity, inbreeding has led to congenital defects in this breed such as hip displasia. They are also known to suffer Hemolytic anaemia and Progressive Retinal Atrophy. Exercise: This breed is active and energetic and requires good daily walks or jogs to keep them fit and healthy. They are not recommended for apartment dwelling as they need plenty of space. The Entlebucher needs plenty of physical and mental stimulation as it is a working dog. They do best when they have a job to do.","('Working',)","Singles Active, outdoorsy types Families with older children",Self confident Devoted Independent Agile
Estrela Mountain Dog,Weight Male 75-110 lbs (34-45 kg) Female  60-90 lbs (27-41 kg),"Originating from Portugal’s Estrela Mountain region, the Estrela Mountain dog is one of the country’s oldest breeds. Used for herding and guarding, they were prized by both farmers and aristocrats for their ability with both flock and estate. It took hundreds of years of breeding the best guardian-herding dogs to produce today's standard of Estrela Mountain Dog. Breeders selected the largest and strongest dogs in the hope of creating a dog that was fearless, independent and loyal.  While the standard of the breed was developed in 1933, there was so little documentation by the original shepherd breeders that the standard was not actually honed until the late 1950s. The Portuguese police use Estrela Mountain Dogs for police work as well as to pull carts. The dog is quite rare in the United States, although there are a growing number of breeders, as well as the Estrela Mountain Dog Association of America.","While your Estrela Mountain Dog will be loyal and affectionate towards you, it may be aloof towards others. It is integral that they are well socialised with both dogs and people, especially with children, when young as the breed tends to be naturally wary of strangers. Very friendly by nature, they will warm up once they become familiar with people. Having originally been bred to fight off wolves and protect sheep, they are very defensive of their territory. Intelligent and alert, it is their natural instinct to assume the dominant role. It is integral that you, as the owner, assert your position and the lines are clearly defined and rules are set. Like many other mountain dog breeds, the Estrela Mountain Dog is particularly good with children. The Estrela Mountain Dog needs plenty of mental and physical stimulation. They are not designed for apartment life and at the least need a large yard to play in. Because its thick coat protects it so well, it can happily cope with living out-doors provided it has proper shelter. Patient, kind and gentle, it makes a great family dog as well as a protective guardian. This assertive and versatile dog is able to switch from defensive mode to nurturing mode as needed. You will enjoy living with your Estrela Mountain Dog as long as the leadership is clear.","The Estrela Mountain Dog is an agile and hardy breed. Loving and affectionate, they form deep attachments to their family and do not take well to being re-homed. Alternatively, they are aloof and wary with strangers and will not hesitate to protect their home and territory. Ever alert, they make excellent guard dogs and are prone to barking. They are also prone to wandering and are best kept in a securely fenced yard. While they are very independent and headstrong, the Estrela Mountain dog is also loving and affectionate. They are great with children and are hardy enough to make a tireless playmate. Endlessly loyal, the Estrela Mountain Dog is the perfect family companion.","The Estrela Mountain Dog is a formidable, beautiful dog. The head is long and powerful with broad, slightly rounded skull. It should have a large black nose, well developed jaws and tightly closed black lips. The eyes are black rimmed and oval in shape, coloured amber or darker. The ears should be small and moderately high set, while the jaw and teeth should be very strong with a complete scissor bite. The forelegs are straight and well muscled, while the back is preferably short, slightly higher at withers and almost level. The chest should be moderately deep and broad and the ribs well sprung. The tail is feathered and set low. The feet are oval with thick, hard pads and tightly closed toes with black nails. The Estrela Mountain Dog has a thick, coarse coat that comes in both long-haired and short-haired varieties. Those with the long coat have a thick outer coat that is slightly coarse without being too harsh. The hair lies close over the body and is flat or slightly waved and never curly. The undercoat is very dense and normally lighter in colour than the outer coat. The head features short and smooth hair that diminishes in length from the base of ears to the tip. The hair is thick and abundant around the neck and chest and forms a ruff, particularly in the male. The forearms, thighs, rear pasterns and tail are abundantly feathered, while there is short, smooth hair on the front of the legs. Those with a short coat have a thick and slightly coarse overcoat with a shorter, dense undercoat. Any feathering should be in proportion.","The Estrela Mountain Dog comes in a range of colour variations. The fawn tone varies from burnt yellow to a deep red. The wolf grey tone is a mixture of grey and black hairs intermingled. The Estrela Mountain Dog also comes in brindle, where the fawn or wolf grey tones come with streaks or smudges of black or brown varying in intensity.","While they are trainable, the Estrela Mountain Dog has a tendency to be stubborn and wilful. Early socialization and obedience training is required. They will not respond to harsh or heavy-handed methods and as a result training must be done with fairness and consistency. Patience and time is required to make this a great family dog.",Grooming the Estrela Mountain Dog is surprisingly easy for the majority of the year -- just a brush a week -- but twice annually they shed heavily and need several daily brushings. Bathing should be done only when necessary.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 14 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, if your Estrela Mountain Dog does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. The Estrela Mountain Dog is robust, with few recorded health problems and a long life expectancy for a large working dog. Hip and elbow dysplasia are the most common issues faced by this breed, and it is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. However, if you are careful who you buy from, your Golden Retriever should give you many years of good health, fun and loving companionship.","('Pastoral',)",Experienced dog owners Families Active owners Country dwellers,Kind Gentle Patient Protective
Eurasier,Medium: Weight Male 50 – 70 lb (23 – 32 kg) Female 40 – 60 lb (18 – 26 kg) Height Male 20 – 24” (52 – 60 cm) Female 16 – 18” (48 – 56 cm,"The breed was developed in Germany in 1960 by Julius Wipfel and Charlotte Baldamus. They wanted to create a wolf-like spitz with a family-dog temperament and developed the Eurasier by crossing the Wolfspitz with the Chow-Chow. Originally the breed was called the Wolf-Chow until it was crossed with a Samoyed when it was renamed the Eurasier. The breed was recognised by the FCI in 1973. Nobel Laureate Konrad Lorenz obtained a Eurasier puppy from Charlotte Baldamus, Nanette vom Jaegerhof, whom he called ""Babett"". He thought her character was the best he had ever known in a dog. Eurasiers are still a comparably young breed. The three Eurasier Clubs are in the German Kennel Club VDH / FCI —EKW, KZG, and ZG—therefore strongly direct and supervise breeding in Germany. A group of very dedicated Eurasier Clubs have joined together in the International Federation for Eurasier Breeding (IFEZ) in the FCI. Eurasier puppies bred according to these sound IFEZ guidelines receive an IFEZ certificate. The Eurasier breed was recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) in 1995 as a member of Group 3 (Working Dogs). Today, unethical breeders sometimes try to pass off a Wolfspitz/Chow Chow mix as a Eurasier. While they are genetically similar, these mixes cannot be classified as Eurasiers.","While this breed is not considered a working or hunting dog, they still make very good protectors as they are watchful yet restrained. They are playful and gentle with children and have a teddy bear quality to them due to their cuddly nature and big coat. The Eurasier is an excellent companion dog as they are quiet, calm, even tempered and friendly. They are affectionate and loyal to their family but rather shy and reserved with strangers but not timid or aggressive. They need early socialisation and bond well with their family. This breed is intelligent and quick to learn, benefitting from early training. They are not good guard dogs but work well as watchdogs as they will bark at things that are unfamiliar. They do not bark without good reason","This breed is calm and even tempered. They are watchful and alert but reserved towards strangers. They require constant, close contact with their family and consistent training which will encourage them to form a strong bond with their family. They can be sensitive to harsh training but are intelligent and dignified.  They do not do well in a kennel environment as they were bred to be companion dogs. They work well as therapy dogs and enjoy many activities such as agility in which they excel. They are calm and quiet inside the house but are lively and animated outside.","This breed has a thick double coat and a wedge shaped head. The muzzle is tapered with dark eyes and erect, triangular shaped ears. The neck is strong and muscular and they may have some chest mane. The tail is plumed and can either be carried over the back or hanging. This breed is balanced, well-constructed and medium sized. The breed may have a pink, blue-black or spotted tongue. Coat: Eurasier has a Spitz-type frame covered in a thick, medium-length coat that can come in almost any colour. Fédération Cynologique Intenationale (FCI) standards call for the Eurasier to have a thick undercoat and medium-long, loosely lying guard hair all over the body, with a short coat on the muzzle, face, ears, and front legs. The tail and the back of the front legs (feathers) and hind legs (breeches) should be covered with long hair. The coat on the Eurasier's neck should be slightly longer than on the body, but not forming a mane.","The coat comes in different colours: fawn, red, wolf-grey, solid black, and black and tan. All colour combinations are allowed, except for pure white, white patches, and liver colour.","This breed is intelligent and responds well to training but they do not respond well to ruthless discipline. They do best with a soft reprimand that is firm but not harsh. Proper human to canine communication is a must. They can get bored with repetitive training and may become stubborn with a passive or meek owner. This breed should never be restricted to only a yard, kennel, crate or left chained up as they can pine and become depressed. Training should only be done by family members, not strangers or handlers",This breed needs regular brushing and grooming particularly during Spring and Autumn shedding seasons,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 11 and 13 years, however, some live for as long as 14 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed has relatively few genetic health issues but should be tested for common ailments such as hip dysplasia and hypothyroidism. They can also suffer patella luxation and eyelid and lash disorders such as distichiae, entropion and ectropion. Exercise: This breed is happy in an average sized apartment provided they have plenty of exercise and family time. The Eurasier does not do well left alone or confined in small spaces. They are not suited to an outside kennel, being chained up or confined to one room, doing best when they are included as part of the family. If left alone or isolated for long periods of time they can become depressed. They require a good amount of exercise such as long daily walks and benefit from having a safe enclosed area to run free.","('Utility',)",Families Outdoorsy types Active singles,Easygoing Independent Dignified Positive
Field Spaniel,Medium: Weight 35 – 50 lb (18 – 25 kg) Height Male 18” (46 cm) Female 17” (43 cm),"The Field Spaniel originated in England as a cross between the Cocker Spaniel and several longer and larger dogs of the Spaniel family. Early litters of these types contained both Field and Cocker spaniels. Once the Field Spaniel was recognised as a separate breed it was selectively bred with disastrous results. It was unable to work as well in the field as it had been.. The breed was re-developed into a fine bird dog by the 1920s but due to the immense popularity of Springer and Cocker Spaniels, the Field Spaniel is quite rare in the US. They were bred mainly for competition and companionship but suffered a drop in popularity during the 1940s due to breeding practices that made the dog very long and low. Dog enthusiasts have since restored the Field Spaniel, which continues to be an affectionate household companion. By the end of World War II they were very rare and their championship status was withdrawn. However, breeders managed to restore this breed, for the field and show ring, by introducing Springer Spaniels and English Cockers into the breed lines. This resulted in the Field Spaniel increasing in numbers and championship status was restored in 1969.","The Field Spaniel has a calm demeanour but does not appreciate rough play or poor treatment. They love children and get along with other pets but expect to be treated with respect. As a working breed, this dog is at its best when it has a job to do. The Field Spaniel is a well balanced, medium sized breed and is the total embodiment of utility, beauty, hunter and companion. This breed is built for activity and endurance in both water and heavy cover. They are noble, proud, docile and abundant in their enthusiasm and affection","Of all the Spaniel breeds, the Field Spaniel is considered to have the best personality. They are playful, intelligent, sweet and well mannered. They have a tendency to be reserved with strangers but generally loves everyone. They are independent but can be stubborn at times. They are excellent with considerate, well behaved children and are good with other dogs and animals. They have a tendency to become overly attached to one specific family member and will ignore all others. This breed thrives on human companionship and can become neurotic if deprived of human interaction. They are alert and will bark to alert the family of visitors and unfamiliar sounds. With their retrieving nature this breed loves to carry objects around in their mouth","The Field Spaniel has a sturdy, medium sized frame and is a little stockier and longer than the Cocker Spaniel. They have well proportioned heads with long muzzles, large noses with open nostrils, almond shaped eyes and long, well feathered ears. The neck is strong, long and muscular. The chest should be deep and the top line level. The front legs should appear straight; the back legs should be strong and muscular. The feet should be round and tight. Their movement should be a long stride with a good driving action from the rear. Customarily docked to one third, the tail should be low set, never carried above the top line and it should have adequate feathering. If undocked the attributes are the same and it should reach to the hocks and be of moderate length in balance with the rest of the dog. Coat: The coat is of moderate length and is either flat or slightly wavy. It is weather resistant and dense in texture. The coat is silky, glossy with setter-like feathering behind the legs and on the chest and stomach.","The most common coat colour is black but may also come in liver, mahogany red or golden liver. Tan markings or speckles may also be present.","This breed requires early socialisation to prevent timidity and dog aggression later in life. This breed does best when it has a job to do. They learn quickly but are sensitive and do not respond well to harsh or heavy handed training. They require firm, fair, consistent and loving training and excels in tracking, hunting and retrieving.",Their silky coat needs regular brushing at least twice a week and bi-monthly clipping to keep it in good condition. The ears should be checked and cleaned on a regular basis. This breed is best suited to a cooler climate.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 13 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. Due to their rarity, relatively little is known about the ailments of this breed as little veterinary research has been carried out on the Field Spaniel. Some breed lines which have Springer Spaniels in their ancestry may be susceptible to the same ailments as the Springer Spaniel. The Field Spaniel is prone to hip dysplasia, thyroid disease, ear infections and eye problems. Exercise: This breed requires excessive amounts of exercise and is not suited to a sedentary family or lifestyle. They are at their best when they have a job to do or they have a chance to romp and run around. They are not recommended to apartment life. This breed is moderately active indoors but requires a large securely fenced yard or a home in the country. They enjoy swimming, playing ball, jogging and hunting. Due to their hunting nature it is essential to ensure they have a safe, well enclosed space to play in.","('Gundog Breed Classification: The Field Spaniel is a member of the gundog group.

Finnish Lapphund,not available,"The Finnish Lapphund is considered to be an ancient Scandinavian breed possibly dating back to 7000 BC.  They were originally used to herd reindeer which was of utmost importance at the time in Lapland, where the dog is believed to have its beginnings.  They are an Arctic Spitz breed and are still used for herding cattle and reindeer alongside companionship. They have been known by many names including ‘The Lappish Herder’, ‘The Lapponian Sheep Dog’ and affectionately as ‘Lappie’. The official name ‘The Finnish Lapphund’ was confirmed in 1993. Although mostly popular in their native Finland and other Nordic countries, the Finnish Lapphund is slowly gaining recognition elsewhere. The first American litter was born in the 1988, and the breed was first introduced into the UK in 1989. During the 90s, the Finnish Lapphund was introduced to Australia and Canada and is now recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club and the New Zealand Kennel Club. They have not yet been recognized fully by the American Kennel Club but have rather been accepted into the miscellaneous group for now.","Your Finnish Lapphund can be infuriatingly intelligent. He takes very well to training and is extremely hard working. Due to his background in herding, he is very alert and holds a watchful eye. This doesn’t mean he is aggressive by any means; he is actually incredibly friendly and likes company. He has been working with humans for years in his ancestry and would rather co-operate with you rather then work against you. Of course he can be a little stubborn sometimes (who isn’t?) but you can work round him with rewards and praise.  He loves the outdoors and enjoys playing with a variety of toys, especially as a puppy. Although he is quite independent and can amuse himself, be wary of leaving him alone for extended periods of time as he can become bored. Although a good watch dog, he is not a good guard dog as he tends to flee from confrontation and aggression.","Like a box of chocolates, the Finnish Lapphund appeals to everyone. His considerate and friendly demeanour means he gets on with the elderly, young children and the disabled. This makes him a prime choice for a novice dog owner, or for someone who may have had a bad experience with dogs in the past. If introduced properly, he will remain considerate of other household pets, and is mostly friendly towards other dogs.  He can be protective, which makes him wary of strangers and unfamiliar things and he will bark to alert his owners of anything untoward. He absolutely loves the outdoors and his cold proof coat alongside his curious nature means endless fun for him once allowed to roam. His pastoral nature makes him an excellent companion and extremely affectionate. If you want a good all-rounder with a good work ethic, the Finnish Lapphund is the dog of your dreams!","The Finnish Lapphund is extremely distinctive with his double coat. The undercoat is thick and short and the top coat is long straight and coarse. This coat is extremely durable, waterproof and ‘winter proof’ which led the breed to be one of only two dog breeds permitted to live outside. They have a broad head with a slightly rounded forehead and dark features such as a black nose and oval, dark eyes. They have straight muzzles which are shorter than the skull with a slightly tapered view from the side. Their ears are erect and pointed. They have a strong jaw with scissor bite and a strong neck. The whole body is strong and sturdy, with strong straight fore and hind legs and well arched, oval feet. The tail is covered with long hair, curled up when in motion and hanging whilst the dog stands. Around the head and neck, the Finnish Lapphund sports an abundance of thick fur, giving an almost wolf-esque mane. The Finnish Lapphund is a handsome dog with a humble, understated and relatively low maintenance appearance.","The Finnish Lapphund is seen in a wide array of colours, including black, sable, tan, white, brown and golden. Sometimes they have markings of different colours alongside their main colour. This breed can also have markings around the eyes (a bit like glasses), where a different colour to their main outlines their eye socket","Finnish Lapphunds are known for excelling in dog shows and obedience classes. They have competed in dog agility trials, herding tasks and showmanship contests. Although the Finnish Lapphund takes well to training, it must be introduced at an early age in order to keep consistent order. This is due to the breeds’ intelligence, and without a firm hand he could easily fall out of line. Not too firm, as they do not respond well to a military style atmosphere. It is recommended that training sessions are kept short and varied as if not, he will get bored and you will lose your faithful audience! It is also recommended to socialise from as early as possible in order to get him used to both fellow pets and humans alike. Provided he is trained from an early age with a strong upper hand, he will aim to please you. A strong will is key here; don’t let his cuteness sway you! Exercise: The Finnish Lapphund requires a great deal of exercise daily. He will be at his happiest having had 60-80 minutes of exercise per day and should be let off the lead to run freely. They will enjoy any kind of games you introduce them to which is great exercise as well as bonding time. Provided he is given a strong exercise routine, he will be happy in any sized home","The Finnish Lapphund is not recommended in a household with those who have allergies due to his thick coat. A male dog will shed heavily once a year, and a female twice a year. During those times it is important to pay particular attention to grooming. Outside of these times, they will need to be groomed daily and bathed only when absolutely necessary","You can expect your Finnish Lapphund to live up to 17 years if cared for correctly. They have fairly few health complaints, but can succumb to hip dysplasia (when the hip moves abnormally), and eye problems such as cataracts. Check-ups, proper nutrition and the correct shots at the Vet will ensure that any illness is caught early on and your new pal will enjoy a long and healthy life.",not available,Families Singles or couples with active lives People who like the outdoors Ranchers and Farmers in cool climates.,"Well Balanced Hard Working Friendly Intelligent Active How am I coming across?

Character: Your Finnish Lapphund can be infuriatingly intelligent. He takes very well to training and is extremely hard working. Due to his background in herding, he is very alert and holds a watchful eye. This doesn’t mean he is aggressive by any means; he is actually incredibly friendly and likes company. He has been working with humans for years in his ancestry and would rather co-operate with you rather then work against you. Of course he can be a little stubborn sometimes (who isn’t?) but you can work round him with rewards and praise.  He loves the outdoors and enjoys playing with a variety of toys, especially as a puppy. Although he is quite independent and can amuse himself, be wary of leaving him alone for extended periods of time as he can become bored. Although a good watch dog, he is not a good guard dog as he tends to flee from confrontation and aggression. Temperament: Like a box of chocolates, the Finnish Lapphund appeals to everyone. His considerate and friendly demeanour means he gets on with the elderly, young children and the disabled. This makes him a prime choice for a novice dog owner, or for someone who may have had a bad experience with dogs in the past. If introduced properly, he will remain considerate of other household pets, and is mostly friendly towards other dogs.  He can be protective, which makes him wary of strangers and unfamiliar things and he will bark to alert his owners of anything untoward. He absolutely loves the outdoors and his cold proof coat alongside his curious nature means endless fun for him once allowed to roam. His pastoral nature makes him an excellent companion and extremely affectionate. If you want a good all-rounder with a good work ethic, the Finnish Lapphund is the dog of your dreams! Conformation: The Finnish Lapphund is extremely distinctive with his double coat. The undercoat is thick and short and the top coat is long straight and coarse. This coat is extremely durable, waterproof and ‘winter proof’ which led the breed to be one of only two dog breeds permitted to live outside. They have a broad head with a slightly rounded forehead and dark features such as a black nose and oval, dark eyes. They have straight muzzles which are shorter than the skull with a slightly tapered view from the side. Their ears are erect and pointed. They have a strong jaw with scissor bite and a strong neck. The whole body is strong and sturdy, with strong straight fore and hind legs and well arched, oval feet. The tail is covered with long hair, curled up when in motion and hanging whilst the dog stands. Around the head and neck, the Finnish Lapphund sports an abundance of thick fur, giving an almost wolf-esque mane. The Finnish Lapphund is a handsome dog with a humble, understated and relatively low maintenance appearance. Colour: The Finnish Lapphund is seen in a wide array of colours, including black, sable, tan, white, brown and golden. Sometimes they have markings of different colours alongside their main colour. This breed can also have markings around the eyes (a bit like glasses), where a different colour to their main outlines their eye socket Training: Finnish Lapphunds are known for excelling in dog shows and obedience classes. They have competed in dog agility trials, herding tasks and showmanship contests. Although the Finnish Lapphund takes well to training, it must be introduced at an early age in order to keep consistent order. This is due to the breeds’ intelligence, and without a firm hand he could easily fall out of line. Not too firm, as they do not respond well to a military style atmosphere. It is recommended that training sessions are kept short and varied as if not, he will get bored and you will lose your faithful audience! It is also recommended to socialise from as early as possible in order to get him used to both fellow pets and humans alike. Provided he is trained from an early age with a strong upper hand, he will aim to please you. A strong will is key here; don’t let his cuteness sway you! Exercise: The Finnish Lapphund requires a great deal of exercise daily. He will be at his happiest having had 60-80 minutes of exercise per day and should be let off the lead to run freely. They will enjoy any kind of games you introduce them to which is great exercise as well as bonding time. Provided he is given a strong exercise routine, he will be happy in any sized home Care: The Finnish Lapphund is not recommended in a household with those who have allergies due to his thick coat. A male dog will shed heavily once a year, and a female twice a year. During those times it is important to pay particular attention to grooming. Outside of these times, they will need to be groomed daily and bathed only when absolutely necessary Health: You can expect your Finnish Lapphund to live up to 17 years if cared for correctly. They have fairly few health complaints, but can succumb to hip dysplasia (when the hip moves abnormally), and eye problems such as cataracts. Check-ups, proper nutrition and the correct shots at the Vet will ensure that any illness is caught early on and your new pal will enjoy a long and healthy life.

Finnish Spitz,not available,"Although Spitz-type dogs have been present in Europe for over 6,000 years, the type that we know and love today were developed in the late 1880s by a gentleman named Hugo Roos who, amongst rife cross-breeding at the time, selected untainted examples of the original Finnish Spitz and bred them in order to revive the breed. Although recognised as a Hound by the British Kennel Club, the Finnish Spitz was originally used to help huntsman obtain food, and are known still used for their valuable hunting skills in their native Finland, these qualities could potentially cross them over into the Gundog category. The Finnish Spitz goes by several nicknames including his original native name Suomenpystrykorva(the Finnish Cock-eared dog) alongside Finsk Spets and the Finnish Barking Birddog. The latter comes from the breeds’ tendency to bark when finding their prey, a distinctive yodel type bark accompanied with pointing their head in the direction of the animal. This even led to participating in barking contests where the dogs were known to bark over 150 times in one minute! Alongside being an excellent bird hunter, Finnish Spitz has also been known to tackle bears and elk! As Finlands’ national dog, the Finnish Spitz’ popularity remains stable there are and in Scandinavian countries.  In the USA the breed is not as popular, and was first recognized by the AKC in 1987.","Headstrong, intelligent and gorgeous (much like yourself), your Finnish Spitz makes an excellent watch dog using his distinctive bark and fantastic hearing. That said, he is rather tame and doesn’t often find himself in aggressive or violent situations. He is a fantastic family dog and excellent with children, keeping them occupied for hours on end. He rarely bites and will distance himself from rough play. Although he loves company, unlike some other breeds he doesn’t necessarily need it. He is intelligent and inquisitive and can make decisions on his own merit. Despite this, he will be at his happiest during family time and loves being included.","The phrase ‘his bark is worse than his bite’ is literal for your Finnish Spitz. In the past these dogs were ‘bred to bark’ and it is imperative that owners quell this at a young age through loving and gentle training. His intelligence can sometimes go to his head and it is very important that he is introduced into the household knowing that his place is below the humans. Once his place in the family is established, your Finnish Spitz will settle in nicely and become a valuable friend and protector to everyone especially children and older adults. They do not fully mature until the age of 3 or 4 and it is recommended that during this time they are socialised as much as possible with both humans and other pets. Once socialised correctly, he will thrive in the company of people to the point of intense and infectious excitement!

His tail is plumed and curls up over the back and down the side with an abundance of hair. He has a double coat with a short, soft, dense undercoat covered by long straight harshly textured hairs. The coat is denser at the legs, tail, neck and back. Male dogs sport a longer and more coarse coat than females whose coat is more polished. Overall the Finnish Spitz has a striking and distinct look.","The Finnish Spitz comes in autumn-y colours of brown, honey and auburn. Puppies are born dark and lighten to a reddish colour as they grow.

Flat Coated Retriever,not available,"The Flat Coated Retriever was developed in the 1800's and is a cross between the Irish Setter, Labrador, Water Dog, and St. John's Newfoundland. It is also believed that the Collie is in the bloodline of this dog as well. He is commonly confused with that of the Labrador Retriever and Golden Retriever, however is in a category all his own. This breed does exceptionally well in hunting, tracking, watch dogging, and also agility and obedience. The Flat-Coated Retriever was once considered a generic ""Labrador"" type dog, called a ""Retriever Proper"". It was developed in the 1800s from various retriever and spaniel water type dogs such as the Newfoundland, Irish Setter, Labrador, Water Spaniels and possibly the Collie. Some of these dogs were born with a flat, wavy coat and eventually they were categorized as a separate breed becoming the Flat-Coated Retriever. The Flat-coats became very popular until the beginning of the World War when their numbers dwindled and their popularity never reached those high numbers again. More people choose to own a Labrador Retriever or Golden Retriever because they are cheaper and easier to find. The dogs were used by fisherman and hunters. They have a superior sense of smell, are excellent swimmers, and are able to work well in marshy areas.  They are wonderful bird dogs doing very well retrieving on plains and in areas thick with trees and bushes. The Flat-Coated Retriever was recognized by the AKC in 1915. Some of the Flat-Coated Retriever's talents are retrieving, hunting, tracking, watchdog and agility.","A gentle giant and always up for a cuddle, the Flat Coated Retriever is unmatchable when it comes to affection. Fiercely loyal, he will build and maintain strong bonds with everyone in the family and loves children. He loves to exercise and is fearless when it comes to water due to his ancestry. He loves a good swim as much as a good hug and enjoys being in the outdoors. Sometimes referred to as the ‘Peter Pan’ of the dog world, the Flattie retains his puppy like demeanour well into his later life","Just happy to be included, Flatties enjoy any activity that can be done as part of the family. This can be a walk, coming for a drive, or just settling down in front of the TV. He is a loyal and affectionate companion and thrives when socialising. Never passive or rude, he is great with strangers and people warm to his endearing and fun loving personality. He is very intelligent and eager to please, but can only do so effectively when given affection and attention in return. Although Flatties may bark as a warning to intruders, they will rarely back it up with aggression and get on extremely well with other dogs. Flat Coated retrievers are a fantastic family dog with a brave heart and docile, loving personality. When accepting a Flattie into your family, you are accepting the most loyal friend you’ll ever have.","The Flat-Coated Retriever is a beautiful medium to large sized dog. The head is long with a fairly flat skull. The muzzle is long, deep and strong with a gradual, slight stop. The large nose is black on black dogs and brown on liver dogs. The teeth meet in a scissors or level bite. The medium sized eyes are almond shaped and can be dark brown, or hazel. The well feathered ears are relatively small compared to the size of the head, hanging to the sides. The chest is deep and wide and the back is short and square. The strong feet are round. The medium length, thick, fine coat lays flat to the body and comes in solid black, or a solid liver, with well-feathered legs, tail and chest.",Flat-Coats usually come in black or shades of liver.,"The Flat Coated Retriever is a highly intelligent and trainable dog and makes a wonderful student. This breed is very jolly and energetic so should require consistency, however excessive repetition is sure to bore him and he will quickly lose interest.

Making training fun with a variety of techniques will be sure to keep his attention, and he will excel much further. Flat Coated retrievers have won ‘Best in Show’ at Crufts numerous times over the years.EXERCISE: The Flat-Coated Retriever is not recommended for apartment life. He is relatively inactive indoors and will do best with at least an average-sized yard. This breed needs to be with his family to be happy. It does best when it is allowed to live inside and play outside. This active dog needs a daily walk or jog to be on its best behaviour.

It especially enjoys the chance to hunt or swim. The Flat-Coated Retriever makes an excellent jogging companion. Given the right training, this breed can excel in many different sports.","The Flat Coated Retriever does require quite a bit of grooming due to the feathering on the lower quarters of the dog. This breed should be brushed on a regular basis with a firm bristle brush, but should only be bathed when necessary. The coat of this breed has the tendency to trap burrs and sticks so if this breed is to have free roam in a yard, the coat should be checked for said items. This breed doesn't need much trimming as the coat is usually of natural length, however some trimming may be required occasionally","Flat Coated Retrievers are more prone to cancer than other types of dog. Common health issues include epilepsy and glaucoma. Less common health concerns are diabetes and seizures. Due to their size, Flatties are less susceptible to hip dysplasia and luxating patellas. Their life span is 8-10 years.",not available,"Active Singles Families, even with young children and other pets Hikers and joggers",Warm and loving Amazingly adaptable Active and spirited outdoors Calm and easy going indoors

However, they have very different origins: The Smooth Fox Terrier derived from the working terriers of Wales and Durham, while the coarse-coated Wire Fox Terrier—bred for rougher terrain—has Beagle and Greyhound in its family tree. Official standards for each breed were established in 1984. The Fox Terrier was developed by crossing ancient Dachshunds, English Hounds, and later the Fox Hound and Beagle. It is one of the oldest terrier type dogs, originating in the British Isles in the 17th century. They were used by farmers who needed dogs to help get rid of the animals that would prey on the farmers stock, such as fox and rats and other small vermin. The Fox Terrier would find the animal in the ground relentlessly, digging, barking, growling and lunging until it harassed the animal out of its den where the hunter could then kill it. The Fox Terrier came in both a smooth coat and a wirehaired coat and was considered the same breed for many years. The Wirehaired Fox Terrier was bred by crossing in the rough coated black and tan terrier, for use in rough country, its coat being less vulnerable to damage than that of the Smooth Fox Terrier. The first standard for the Smooth Fox Terrier was established in 1876, separating it from the wirehaired dogs. However they are still considered the same breed with different coat varieties by some clubs, but have been separated in the United States since 1984. Both the Smooth Fox Terrier and the Wirehaired Fox Terrier were recognized by the AKC in 1885. Some of the Fox Terrier's talents include: hunting, tracking, watchdog, agility and performing tricks. As of 2010, the Wire Fox Terrier had won more’ best in show’ titles than any other breed at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show, boasting over 13 titles. Character: Charismatic and lively, the Wire Fox Terrier can brighten up any room. Although loving and loyal, this breed can be wary of strangers so early socialization is vital. The Wire Fox Terriers lovable personality and sense of humour can make him a hit with families, but potential owners are advised to do their research beforehand in order to make sure they can provide the right environment and lifestyle for this little firecracker. It is exciting to own a Wire Fox Terrier due to their combination of energy and intelligence, but it is also important to keep an eye on them. They do not see the difference between big and small, and will treat a horse as they would a mouse, this can lead them into trouble. It is important to keep a firm hand and alpha role when owning the Wire Fox Terrier in order for him to live a long, happy and varied life. Temperament: With a naturally alert temperament, the Wire Fox Terrier will make an excellent watch dog. He however, will not fare well as a guard dog. Although generally friendly, care should be taken with smaller children as this breed can snap when exposed to rough play, or when pestered. It is advisable that the Wire Fox Terrier is not exposed to smaller and more passive animals, as he cannot be trusted, so please consider your other pets when opting for this breed. It will take early training and socialization in order for the Wire Fox Terrier to lose their aggression towards other dogs, but will prove rewarding in later life. The Wire Fox Terrier is extremely loyal and hungry for affection, he requires a great deal of love and attention which is why he is not recommended for working couples/singles as he will hate being left alone. Conformation: Wire Fox Terriers have small, elegant frames covered in dense and curly white coats with black or brown patches. They have broad, flat heads with long, full muzzles. Their V-shaped ears usually bend forward, and their intense eyes are set slightly apart. They have long, muscular necks that slope down to deep chests and short backs. Their tails, sometimes docked, are carried high. Overall, the Wire Fox Terrier has a rugged but distinguished look.  The Wirehaired Fox Terrier is a medium sized dog. The skull is flat, moderately narrowing to the eyes. The stop is slight. The muzzle gradually tapers to the black nose. The teeth should meet in a scissors bite. The eyes and eye rims are dark in colour. The small V-shaped ears drop forward close to the cheeks. The neck is thick and muscular. The legs are straight. The tail is high set and is usually docked by 1/4, leaving 3/4 of the original length. Note: the practice of docking tails is illegal in most parts of Europe. The wiry coat has dense twisted, hairs similar to the hair on the outside of a coconut. The hairs are so thick and close together that when they are parted you cannot see the skin. It has a short, soft undercoat. The coat is predominately white with black or brown markings. Colour: White should predominate brindle, red, or liver markings Training: Wire Fox Terriers, like many other breeds, can lose interest very quickly. Due to their lively and independent personality, it is advisable that this breed is trained from an early age with a firm and consistent handler. This is a demanding role, and is not recommended for novice trainers as proper techniques need to be performed in order to get the correct result. When handled wrongly, this breed will prove very difficult to train and become a tyrant. Do not make the mistake of underestimating this dog because of its size! Wire Fox Terriers have a feisty personality and need positive training to ensure proper socialization.

Hunting, watch dogging, agility, tracking and performing tricks are all on this breeds list of preferred hobbies. They love exercise, and are incredibly active with boundless energy. Although he can cope without a garden, a proper exercise routine will need to be in place in order for him to be happy, and nothing can beat an unrestricted run around a fenced area. Wire Fox Terriers do well running alongside bicycles, and enjoy long jogs with owners – however it is important to keep them on a leash if small animals are around Care: Despite their small stature, Wire Fox Terriers are bold and fearless, and may confront larger dogs. Their natural instinct to hunt is strong, and they will seize every opportunity to chase birds and squirrels. It is important to keep them on a leash for their own protection, and allow them to only run free in a controlled environment. Wire Fox Terriers also enjoy a good swim! The Wire Fox Terrier does require much grooming, however brushing is necessary. Stripping of the coat is required for show dogs, however can be done less frequently if not used for these purposes. Hand plucking of the coat may be necessary to remove dead hairs but should only be performed by an experienced groomer. The Wire Fox Terrier has a much longer beard along his muzzle which should be brushed and cleaned every other day to prevent caking, matting, and dirt. Washing with a mild soap and brushing with a fine-toothed comb will prevent this.  There is a complex show-grooming routine. Professional groomers have quite a bag of tricks to keep the Wire looking its best for the show ring. The Wire shed little to no hair and is good for allergy sufferers. Health: Epilepsy is highly suspected to have a genetic component in this breed. Some minor concerns are post nasal drip, lens luxation, distichiasis, cataracts, Legg-Perthes disease, and shoulder dislocation.

German Pinscher,Medium: Weight Male 25 – 35 lb (11 – 16 kg) Female 25 – 35 lb (11 – 16 kg) Height Male 17 – 20” (43 – 51 cm) Female 16 – 19” (41 – 48 cm),"The German Pinscher originates from Germany, and there is evidence of the breed in drawings dating back to 1780. While the exact mix of breeds which created the German Pinscher are unknown, it is thought that they were bred from a variety of ratters which were well established in the German countryside and had been working on farms as vermin hunters as far back as the 1400s. During the 1830s, German Pinschers became extremely popular in Germany and became more popular than the much loved Mops. The breed was set to work and was commonly used to guard coaches, however they were also used in the home to hunt and kill vermin like rats. Their rat hunting skill has been bred into them and is a natural instinct which they still possess today. Originally, the Standard Schnauzer and German Pinscher were considered the same breed but with different coats. However, after many years of careful breeding, three generations of the same smooth coated Pinscher were born and the varieties were classed as different breeds. Between 1950 and 1958, no German Pincher litters were registered and the breed seemed to be in danger of extinction. An enthusiastic breeder called Waerner Jung collected several German Pinschers and managed to revive the breed, creating the German Pinscher we know and love today. However, there are a few varieties of German Pinscher which are now extinct; the Harlequin Pinscher, the Swiss Shorthair Pinscher and the German Silky Pinscher","Alert and energetic, your German Pinscher is incredibly playful and loves to burn off steam by getting a good daily walk. German Pinschers are lively dogs and have a huge amount of stamina, but can be calm and docile when at home, although he loves to run like the wind when he’s outside exercising. A true companion dog, your German Pinscher is happiest when he’s by your side. He loves to have company and is wonderfully loyal to his family, as well as fiercely protective of them. Though your German Pinscher is generally a quiet dog, he’ll waste no time in raising the alarm with a good solid bark if he senses trouble or danger. This, tamed with his brave nature, makes him an excellent guard and watch dog. When well socialised throughout puppyhood and adulthood, your German Pinscher will get on well with both children and other pets.","The German Pinscher generally has a well-mannered, loving and even temperament. They are affectionate companions and should be fairly friendly with strangers, although they might be wary of visitors at first and bark they will soon calm down and relax. Your German Pinscher is not only incredibly intelligent, but also quite independent. This means that while they can pick up new things easily, they like to be challenged during training and get bored with a lot of repetition. Therefore, you need to make training fun and interesting in order to get the best out of your German Pinscher.","The German Pinscher has a sturdy, medium sized frame with a strong yet graceful appearance. Their skulls are long and flat with a pointed muzzle and muscular cheeks. The medium sized eyes are darkly coloured and oval shaped. The ears are erect and set high. Svelte, elegant necks slope down to a short backs and a flat top-line, while the tail is carried high. The coat is short and dense, with a glossy look.","The German Pinscher has a silky, shiny coat which commonly comes in fawn, red, brown and yellow, and black and tan","Your German Pinscher is very intelligent, so although he can pick up training easily he can also become bored if the training isn’t exciting or challenging enough for him. Your German Pinscher doesn’t like a lot of repetition so it’s best to keep training sessions short and to the point, and have more of them, than to try and engage your German Pinscher in one long training session every now and again. With the right training and a confident owner, your German Pinscher will do exceedingly well in obedience.","An average shedder, the German Pinscher is an incredibly easy breed of dog to groom. All he requires is an occasional brush to remove dead or lose hair. The German Pinscher is a clean breed and should only be bathed when absolutely necessary.","It is important to check your new puppy or dog’s family history for health issues before purchasing him. German Pinschers come from a small gene pool, which means they are prone to a number of genetic health problems including cataracts, hip dysplasia, Von Willebrand Disease and Thyroid problems. Irresponsible breeding has also led to a number of dogs having cardiac disease. The average lifespan of a German Pinscher is approximately 14 years.","('Working',)",Families with older children Couples Active people People who like to jog Country folk,Intelligent Hard working Energetic outside Docile around the house Obedient
German Shepherd,"Large: Male 24” (63cm) to shoulder, Female 22 ½” (58cm), weight 44 – 80 lb (22 – 40kg)","Originating in Germany, German Shepherd dogs were used to herd and guard sheep. Eventually, after much cross breeding of “good” types, the modern German Shepherd Dog (GSD) was standardised in 1899 and registered with the Kennel Club in 1919. Because of their herding and guarding instincts, they have been used extensively and successfully as Police Dogs, and for guard duties. Their intelligence and good looks have led them into the world of film acting, notable characters being Rin Tin Tin and Strongheart. Their powerful scenting ability has also led them to be used in Search and Rescue operations. Because of their strong bonding instincts, they make excellent family dogs","Highly intelligent and alert, your German Shepherd is a loyal and easy going companion provided he is given plenty to occupy that lively mind. Most intelligent of the large breeds, GSD’s can learn a task within 5 repetitions. Maturing at around three years, training and socialisation requires time and patience. Youngsters can be boisterous, so all that energy needs to be channelled to avoid aggression. Your German Shepherd will love to go jogging with you, and will delight in learning tricks, taking part in Dog Agility contests and playing with as well as protecting (and even herding!) your children. In short, your well bred German Shepherd will protect you and yours with all his heart and soul, and be your best friend too.","Highly active, self assured, happy in himself and loves to learn and to have a purpose in life. Your German Shepherd is loyal and bonds well with people he knows, including children. GSDs can be stand-offish with strangers, and can become over-protective of their family and territory, but careful socialisation can avoid this. They hate being on their own for too long, and can become destructive, chewing furniture or digging up your garden, if bored and lonely, or under-occupied.","A good German Shepherd should have great presence, a look of pride and nobility. The body should be slightly longer than tall, sturdy but lean. The neck should slope to muscular shoulders, strong hind legs and a bushy tail. The head should be slightly convex with a long, square muzzle, ears pointed and erect, eyes almond shaped and fairly deep set with a calm, friendly expression. Note: extreme sloping of the back and “legs out behind”, seen in dogs bred for showing should be avoided if this is not your intention. A dog from a working line does not have this feature, and will stay sound for far longer","The most common is black and tan, but they also come in sable, plain black, blue and white. The coat can be short (rough-coated), medium haired or longhaired.","German Shepherds are naturally obedient, and respond best to positive, reward based training rather than a “firm hand” method which can lead to resentment. Ideally, training should start with Puppy School at 12 weeks or as soon as their initial inoculations are complete. Never underestimate their intelligence – they are “thinking” dogs.","The German Shepherd has a double coat - a longer top coat which sheds all the year round, and a soft, dense undercoat. The coat is highly weatherproof, but needs daily grooming to avoid gross shedding, knots in longer coats and skin problems in all types","The lifespan of a healthy individual is around 10 - 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems are usually rare, but poor breeding can mean character faults, and congenital conditions such as Hip Dysplasia, epilepsy, heart defects and blood disorders, especially in dogs from a showing line, so be vigilant if you want to go down this route. German Shepherds’ open, erect ears can make them prone to ear infections. Just be careful who you buy from, to ensure that you take home a healthy, friendly, happy individual.","('Utility',)","Someone with lots of energy, who will teach me stuff and play with me. An active family with children I can play with and look after. People who are natural leaders. Please remember, I need to be treated with authority by everyone in the family, otherwise I tend to forget my manners.","Handsome and sturdy Intelligent and eager to please Loyal, obedient and protective Hardworking Strong willed and fearless Handy"
German Shorthaired Pointer,Height: Dogs 23-25 inches (59-64 cm.) Bitches 21-23 inches (53-58 cm.) Weight: Dogs 55-70 pounds (25-32 kg.) 45-60 pounds (20-27 kg.),"Descended from other German pointer breeds (although its precise origin is unclear), GSPs were originally bred as dogs that were excellent for the weekend hunt, but provided a great companion in the week. With a keen sense of smell, a dependable intelligence and an outgoing personality, German Shorthaired Pointers were ideal for the casual sportsmen who wanted a family-oriented companion as well. The first studbook was created in 1870 and the breed was first recognised by the German Kennel Club in 1930, and has since been a common staple in dog sports, such as agility, obedience, retrieving , field trials and hunting tests. The breeds close historic relatives include the Old Spanish Pointer, German Bird Dog, Hounds of St. Hubert (Bloodhound types), and the Foxhound; eventually, German breeders added English Pointers to the mix, giving the breed a sleek, handsome shape. Its modern relatives include the two other German Pointer types: the Longhaired and the Wirehaired.","GSPs are first and foremost bred to be working and hunting dogs, and as a result that is their ideal environment. However, they were also bred to be great companions and this means that they are very loyal and love interacting with humans.  As a result they possess a good balance of being friendly, outgoing, reliable, hard-working and easy to please. They love going on long walks, chasing things, running through water and swimming; essentially fulfilling their bred requirement of being a gundog. Plenty of space for them to be able to roam is an absolute must, and are probably not best suited to living in flats. They make the perfect running partner, and can even be a cycling partner; as they can still keep up with you even if you’re on a bike. A very active family is required! They have an excellent nose (designed to pick up a hunt scent), and will occasionally bring you ‘trophies’ from their own individual hunts. The dog needs to be properly trained from a young age to make sure it uses this hunt instinct in the right way. They possess high intelligence (ranking 17th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs) and can be trained for dog sports, such as agility and obedience. They do sometimes like to have a good bark, and make great doorbells – or burglar alarms","As with all gundogs, GSPs require copious amounts of exercise and if this is not fulfilled they will become bored and try to exercise themselves, often with  destructive effects to furniture, sofas, the new living room carpet etc. They also do not like to be left alone for extended periods of time, due to their affection with humans. They are great with children, however care must be taken around puppies as they can become very boisterous. Later in life they still are playful, but learn to become affectionate. They are great with other dogs too but, because of the natural hunt instinct, they must be properly trained to deal with other household pets such as rabbits and cats. That being said, they can be very happy to live with other animals. When they lack in exercise they can become high strung, and frustrated. The GSP will not listen if they sense that they are stronger minded, or above,  than their owner, however they will also not respond well to harsh discipline. The GSP needs an owner who displays a natural air of authority. Firm, but calm, confident and consistent with rules they must be made to follow.","GSPs have a balanced shape, muscular and powerful The breed is streamlined yet powerful with strong legs that make it able to move rapidly and turn quickly. It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. The tail is often docked, although this is restricted in some countries. The dog should have the ability to form the classic pointer’s stance; pointing with the head and body. They have webbed feet (idea for being able to swim). The coat is very short and flat, with a stiff undercoat (causing the coat to be water resistant). The teeth should have a full scissor bite and the nose should be equal to the length of the skull. The eyes should be almond coloured","GSPs are commonly brown and white, colours that act as camouflage in the winter; helpful when sneaking up on game. Black and white varieties can also be seen, but these aren’t allowed by American Kennel Club standards.","With a natural hunting reflex, training is essential in order to control the dog. GSPs require a lot of exercise and vigorous activity, and if this is not fulfilled they will have an attempt at amusing themselves. The breed is perhaps best suited to someone who has had previous experience in dog training before. They will not learn from harsh training, but will also not learn if they feel as though they are above their owners. A perfect balance is key.","Because of their short coat, GSPs are very easy to groom and maintain. It sheds on average and they are hypoallergenic, perfect for someone who normally has allergies to fur . Regular checks of the ears is necessary as, like all dogs with floppy ears, they a prone to infection. A GSP is a very active dog, so needs plenty of water to keep It hydrated, and it goes without saying that this is particularly increased on a hot day.","Like all purebreds, GSPs are prone to some health problems including epilepsy, hip dysplasia, hermaphrodism and lymphedema (a tissue condition). Getting the dog hip scored as a puppy by a vet is a must as, due to their active life styles; issues with the legs can create real problems for the dog later on in life. When the dog is a puppy, care must be taken to make sure it receives the right amount of exercise so as not to put strain on its back and legs. In general, though, they are a healthy breed and will live around 12-15 years.

Popularity: The GSP is a popular dog; especially in Germany, with numerous portrayals in popular culture. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>
    Their German name: Deutscher kurzhaariger Vorstehhund Breed History: Descended from other German pointer breeds (although its precise origin is unclear), GSPs were originally bred as dogs that were excellent for the weekend hunt, but provided a great companion in the week. With a keen sense of smell, a dependable intelligence and an outgoing personality, German Shorthaired Pointers were ideal for the casual sportsmen who wanted a family-oriented companion as well. The first studbook was created in 1870 and the breed was first recognised by the German Kennel Club in 1930, and has since been a common staple in dog sports, such as agility, obedience, retrieving , field trials and hunting tests. The breeds close historic relatives include the Old Spanish Pointer, German Bird Dog, Hounds of St. Hubert (Bloodhound types), and the Foxhound; eventually, German breeders added English Pointers to the mix, giving the breed a sleek, handsome shape. Its modern relatives include the two other German Pointer types: the Longhaired and the Wirehaired. Character: GSPs are first and foremost bred to be working and hunting dogs, and as a result that is their ideal environment. However, they were also bred to be great companions and this means that they are very loyal and love interacting with humans.  As a result they possess a good balance of being friendly, outgoing, reliable, hard-working and easy to please. They love going on long walks, chasing things, running through water and swimming; essentially fulfilling their bred requirement of being a gundog. Plenty of space for them to be able to roam is an absolute must, and are probably not best suited to living in flats. They make the perfect running partner, and can even be a cycling partner; as they can still keep up with you even if you’re on a bike. A very active family is required! They have an excellent nose (designed to pick up a hunt scent), and will occasionally bring you ‘trophies’ from their own individual hunts. The dog needs to be properly trained from a young age to make sure it uses this hunt instinct in the right way. They possess high intelligence (ranking 17th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs) and can be trained for dog sports, such as agility and obedience. They do sometimes like to have a good bark, and make great doorbells – or burglar alarms Temperament: As with all gundogs, GSPs require copious amounts of exercise and if this is not fulfilled they will become bored and try to exercise themselves, often with  destructive effects to furniture, sofas, the new living room carpet etc. They also do not like to be left alone for extended periods of time, due to their affection with humans. They are great with children, however care must be taken around puppies as they can become very boisterous. Later in life they still are playful, but learn to become affectionate. They are great with other dogs too but, because of the natural hunt instinct, they must be properly trained to deal with other household pets such as rabbits and cats. That being said, they can be very happy to live with other animals. When they lack in exercise they can become high strung, and frustrated. The GSP will not listen if they sense that they are stronger minded, or above,  than their owner, however they will also not respond well to harsh discipline. The GSP needs an owner who displays a natural air of authority. Firm, but calm, confident and consistent with rules they must be made to follow. Conformation: GSPs have a balanced shape, muscular and powerful The breed is streamlined yet powerful with strong legs that make it able to move rapidly and turn quickly. It has moderately long floppy ears set high on the head. The tail is often docked, although this is restricted in some countries. The dog should have the ability to form the classic pointer’s stance; pointing with the head and body. They have webbed feet (idea for being able to swim). The coat is very short and flat, with a stiff undercoat (causing the coat to be water resistant). The teeth should have a full scissor bite and the nose should be equal to the length of the skull. The eyes should be almond coloured Colour: GSPs are commonly brown and white, colours that act as camouflage in the winter; helpful when sneaking up on game. Black and white varieties can also be seen, but these aren’t allowed by American Kennel Club standards. Training: With a natural hunting reflex, training is essential in order to control the dog. GSPs require a lot of exercise and vigorous activity, and if this is not fulfilled they will have an attempt at amusing themselves. The breed is perhaps best suited to someone who has had previous experience in dog training before. They will not learn from harsh training, but will also not learn if they feel as though they are above their owners. A perfect balance is key. Care: Because of their short coat, GSPs are very easy to groom and maintain. It sheds on average and they are hypoallergenic, perfect for someone who normally has allergies to fur . Regular checks of the ears is necessary as, like all dogs with floppy ears, they a prone to infection. A GSP is a very active dog, so needs plenty of water to keep It hydrated, and it goes without saying that this is particularly increased on a hot day. Health: Like all purebreds, GSPs are prone to some health problems including epilepsy, hip dysplasia, hermaphrodism and lymphedema (a tissue condition). Getting the dog hip scored as a puppy by a vet is a must as, due to their active life styles; issues with the legs can create real problems for the dog later on in life. When the dog is a puppy, care must be taken to make sure it receives the right amount of exercise so as not to put strain on its back and legs. In general, though, they are a healthy breed and will live around 12-15 years.

German Spitz,not available,"European Spitzen have a very long history, and the existence is thought to go back more than 6000 years. They are thought to have descended from thick coated Scandinavian herding dogs, specifically the Samoyed and Lapphund; and bought into central Europe by Vikings. The earliest literary reference is to the Spitz is in 1450. As the name suggests, the modern-day German Spitz originated in Germany and up until the 19th century, this adaptable breed was bred in Germany to be a hunter, herder and watchdog. Over the years, different communities bred different types of Spitz dogs, and this has what caused the many sub-types we see today.  All of these sub-breeds have been bred for specific purposes, for example the Standard Spitz was bred to be a watchdog, while the Pomeranian has was bred to be a companion and lapdog. As I’ve already mentioned, the Pomeranian (named after the Pomorania area of Germany) became very fashionable in 19th century England due to being a favourite with Queen Victoria. The smaller the Pomeranian, the more of a fashion statement the dog was thought to be, so Pomeranians were eventually bred to become smaller and smaller. In early 20th century America the Standard Spitz was bought over, mixed with both the Keeshond and Pomeranian and developed into a sub-breed known as the ‘American Eskimo Dog’. Early experts originally thought that German Spitzen were, in fact, the oldest dog breed (due to their shape resembling old fossils), but modern genetic evidence now disproves this theory.","The German Spitz is a fairly energetic, playful breed with a slightly higher than average intelligence. They are very curious and will like to go on searches while on walks, as well as poking around areas that they are not familiar with. They are loyal to their owners, and this can cause them to become suspicious of strangers. Because of this they make excellent watchdogs, and do enjoy a good bark. This can get out of hand, but with good training this can be honed so that they bark when visitors come to the door and then keep quiet thereafter. They are very playful, and like to stand on their hind legs; a trick that they can learn to do on command. They, especially the Pomeranian, are a regular staple at dog shows such as Crufts, and  they feel very at home on the show floor. They can be lively, especially when young, but they are also sensitive and require much human attention and petting!","Due to their fierce loyalty, and the fact that they have been bred to be watchdogs, proper training of German Spitzen is essential. The dog will need to learn from a young age who is boss and the pack leader (that’s you!) otherwise it will lose interest and will not listen to what you are telling it to do. It cannot be emphasised enough how important it is that the dog learns that it is the humans who are in charge; otherwise they will become very nervous and suspicious around other animals, other humans and, particularly, children - as most children do not have the ‘natural’ command of the animal most adults do. The best way to think about this type of training is to imagine yourself as the ‘pack leader’ as if the dog was in the wild; that way it will learn who is in charge. In general, though, this type of dog, while a little bit difficult to train sometimes, is not overly aggressive or hyperactive or a handful (just temperamental if not trained properly) – and as such it could suit an elderly person.","Spitzen are well known for their show potential and as such they should look proud and lively. They are Medium-sized, sturdy and fluffy with a slightly round head, straight nose and pointy ears. They always have dark eyes, and should constantly look alert. Its coat is rough, profuse and puffy, with multiple layers, while its feathered tail curls over the back. The curled tail is perhaps the most unique aspect of the breed, and this should look healthy and prominent. The dog should be able to straighten and wag its tail without problem. The Miniature Spitz is of similar appearance, but smaller and the Larger Spitz is similar but, well, larger. Keeshonds are also similar, and the main difference between them and the Standard is their coat colour. Pomeranians are much smaller compared to the other breeds and should not be confused with the Miniature.","The German Spitz come in a variety of colours: · Keeshunds are grey or black · The Large Spitz are white, brown or black. · The Standard Sptiz and Minature can be white, brown or black, orange, grey-shaded and other colours. The Pomeranian can be  orange, cream, black, white, sable and a combination thereof","Pack-leader’ training is essential with the German Spitz. If trained properly, though, they will make great companions. Exercise: The breed, especially the smaller versions, make for excellent apartment pets as they only need a relatively small amount of exercise. They do need daily exercise, and if you would like to go running with them then they do like that too.

Take the compatibility test Test your knowledge about the German Spitz Play our Dog Trivia Quiz Information essential about the German Spitz The term ‘German Spitz’ can actually refer to many different types of dog that are of the German Spitz origin. Some of them are classed as single breeds while some are still grouped together; confusingly, this can even vary from national kennel club to national kennel club! In general, however, this article will concern itself with any of these dogs that have descended from the ‘German Spitz’ breed according to the International Federation of Kennel Clubs. The main sub-breeds include (according to the International Federation of Kennel Clubs): · The Keeshond (as it’s known by the British Kennel Club) or Wolfsspitz, a grey coloured dog that is roughly 43-55cm from floor to withers. It has a very fluffy, plush coat and curly tail – a common trait among other German Spitz types. · The Giant Spitz, a larger sub-breed of the Standard Spitz. 42-50cm from floor to withers, and can be white, brown or black. · The German Spitz (Mittel). 30-38cm floor to withers and come in a variety of different colours. This article will deal primarily with this type and to avoid confusion, if I am referring particularly to the German Spitz (Mittel) in this article (say, if I am discussing the dog’s features or weight), I will call it the ‘Standard Spitz’. From the ‘Standard Spitz’, other sub-breeds have also developed; including the American Eskimo Dog. · German Spitz (Klien). 23-29cm floor to withers. Also comes in a variety of different colours. Again to avoid confusion I shall call the German Spitz (Klien) the ‘Miniature Spitz’, if I am referring to this sub-breed particularly. · The Zwergspitz. A tiny version of the German Spitz only 18-22cm from floor to withers. Comes in a variety of colours. If I am specifically referring to this sub-breed I will call it by its common English: the ‘Pomeranian’. These types of dogs were made famous by Queen Victoria. To further add to the Spitz confusion, Pomeranians are classified as a completely separate breed by the UK Kennel Club (The UK Kennel Club is not part of the International Federation of Kennel Clubs). Generally, any dog that is a Spitz type and of which its origins can be traced back to Germany are ‘German Spitz’. Weight: The Standard Spitz is roughly 23-41 pounds (10.5-11.5 kg.) Popularity: Popularity varies from sub-breed to sub-breed. The Standard Spitz is becoming are rare breed, even in Germany. Pomeranians, on the other hand for example, are very popular; especially in the United States were they have become very fashionable and are currently in the top 15 most popular dogs. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3> Breed History: European Spitzen have a very long history, and the existence is thought to go back more than 6000 years.

German Wirehaired Pointer,Height:  Dogs 24-26 inches (60-67 cm.) Bitches 22-24 inches (56-62 cm.) Weight:  60-70 pounds (27-32 kg.),"Sharing a common ancestry with the other German Spitz types (the longhaired and the shorthaired), the Wirehaired was bred specifically as a hunting dog in the early 20th century from various Foxhounds, Poodles and Pointers. The dogs were able to point, track, retrieve, and work as a gun-dog, in both field and water for both feather and fur. They were recognized by the AKC in 1959. The German Wirehaired Pointers talents are show dog, obedience, gun dog, retrieving, tracking trials, field trials, and hunting tests. They were also bred to have webbed feet, making them excellent at swimming.","Energetic, active and intelligent dogs; the German Wirehaired Pointer is a good all round gun dog; and it will always try to work hard for its owner. Because of these hunting instincts, they will constantly look to roam and this means that it will not like being locked inside for any extended period of time. The dog wouldn’t be suitable for apartment, urban, living either; as they – like all gundogs – require a lot of space to be able to fulfil their natural, genetic, gundog instinct. The breed has an excellent nose, meaning it always knows what’s being cooked for dinner, and can be trained easily to track, point and even retrieve with ease. Proper training is required to make sure the dog knows who is boss, and so that it doesn’t dominate you, children, other dogs and other animals. If they think that you are not in charge they can become aloof and bored. It will always look to chase things, and this includes birds, rabbits etc, and good recall training is necessary to make sure they do not constantly do this. They are quite playful dogs, and enjoy playing fetch or playing other games with their owners; they also love a good swim.","A very active and intelligent breed, German Wirehaired Pointers crave exercise to fulfil their hunting instinct. It is absolutely vital that they get this, otherwise they will become very bored; and look to entertain themselves – sometimes with destructive effects. They are particularly attached to their master and may display jealousy. This breed will generally get along well with other dogs and pets, but may try to dominate them. They are aloof and suspicious of strangers and make good watchdogs, and can bark a lot at a knock on the door or the letterbox. They can be trained so that this does not become an issue. The breed can be god with children, but it can become suspicious of them if they do not show a dominant ‘pack-leader’ attitude; so the breed is probably best with families with older children. They are easy to train and, especially when young, very eager to learn.","German Wirehaired Pointers need to have a strong and lively look. The coat is perhaps the breed’s most distinctive feature and is wirey, course and water resistant; and this also protects them from thorns and brambles. This coat sheds moderately. They have fairly long heads that leads to a dark brown nose, and it’s teeth have a straight scissor bite. The neck is strong and slender. The chest is deep and wide. The tail is often docked, the breed a being a hunting breed, but this is illegal in most countries. German Longhaired Pointers have webbed feet, and this helps them to swim. They are medium sized, and easy to transport long distance; but they will become frustrated if kept in a car for too long.",German Wirehairs are usually white or ‘liver’ coloured,"The breed requires training from a young age, and needs to familiarize itself with its owner and other humans. This is absolutely imperative because the dog will become aloof in older age if it does not understand that you are its leader. Training needs to be firm, patient and consistent; but the dog is very willing to learn, and will become an excellent companion if training is completed in this way. German Wirehaired Pointers need a lot of exercise, and it is essential that they have a large amount of space to be able to run about in and rummage about. The breed can be a challenge for even the most active family and they should only be considered as a family pet if you can guarantee plenty of daily vigorous exercise, for the dog. They need to be taken on a daily, brisk, long walk, jog or run alongside you when you bicycle. If they do not receive this amount of exercise, they will become very restless and perhaps even destructive while kept in the home. While out on a walk or jog be sure to make the dog heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, never in front, as instinct tells a dog the leader leads the way, and its pack leader is you. The dog will need training to achieve this. Training must also be taken to make sure that the dog does not pull on the lead.","As the name suggests, German Wirehaired Pointers have a very thick and wirey coat, and they need to be brushed with a thick brush at least twice a week. The coast should be as hard as possible, but not look inertly untidy. The coat also needs some stripping, and this is not hard to learn how to do. The hairs should be hand plucked occasionally depending on the condition of the coat. The coat turns thinner in the spring and autumn and the dog only needs to be bathed very occasionally. Check the ears of the dog regularly to make sure they are clean. The feet should be checked after the dog has been out working, as the webbed toes can pick up thorns.","German Wirehaired Pointers can suffer with the health problems associated with pure bred gun dogs.

Giant Schnauzer,Large: Weight Male 100 lb (45.5 kg) Female 90 lb (41 kg) Height Male 25.5 – 27.5” (65 – 70 cm) Female 23.5 – 25.5” (60 – 65 cm),"Unlike the Miniature Schnauzer and Standard Schnauzer which were bred to be ratters and watchdogs, the Giant Schnauzer was intended for tasks such as hauling, herding and even barroom bouncing. The breed was created by crossing Standard Schnauzers with bigger dogs such as the Great Dane. The breed originated from southern Germany and the nearby regions of Switzerland and France. They have been represented in art and sculptures from the 1400s and were used as cattle herders during this time until railroads were developed. In the 19th century the breed became popular working as guard dogs and they worked during the world wars as police and war dogs which resulted in them almost being wiped out. The Giant Schnauzer was first shown and appeared in American in 1909. The breed has never been extremely popular but they have many endearing qualities.","The Giant Schnauzer makes a very attentive companion. They are very close to their owners, staying nearby and sometimes watching their every move. They love to be involved in every household activity and are very affectionate and attached. They make superb watchdogs and their commanding presence combined with intense family loyalty makes them formidable household guards. They are able to easily distinguish between friend and foe but they will bark only if they sense a threat, rather than random or excessive barking.","This breed is powerful, large yet elegant. They are capable of enduring harsh weather as they are extremely hardy and also independent and courageous. They are proud and determined and make a loyal and trustworthy family pet. This breed is very loving, protective and responsible. They thrive on human companionship and do not do well if left alone for long periods of time. They are lively and active and can be stubborn and wilful so they require a firm hand when training. They can become very territorial. They get on well with other dogs, household pets and children and are ideally suited to an active family. They are quick to alert their family of strangers, making excellent guard and watchdogs. They require early socialisation and train and are not ideal dogs for a novice owner.","This breed is essentially a larger, stronger version of the Standard Schnauzer. They have large, square built frames covered in dense, wiry coats. Their long heads have distinctive bushy moustaches, beards and eyebrows, not to mention deeply set eyes, powerful muzzles and V-shaped ears that point up and forward. The Giant has a rectangular head and the body length equals the height at the withers.The head should be strong, being flat between the ears. They should have a powerful blunt muzzle and a strong jaw with a perfect scissor bite. Their tails, sometimes docked, are carried high. The neck should be relatively long, strong and slightly arched. The chest should be deep and broad, and the topline strong and straight, slightly higher at the shoulder than the back end. The body length should be the same as the height at the withers. The front legs should appear straight when viewed from all angles, the back legs should be well muscled. The feet should be compact, round and short. Overall, Giant Schnauzers have a sturdy, commanding and lively look. Coat: This breed has a double coat. The outer coat should be harsh and wiry with a dense, soft undercoat. The hair is longer over the eyes and on the muzzle to form bushy eyebrows and a distinctive beard. The hair on the legs is longer than the body coat.","The coat comes in solid black, white or salt and pepper. White Schnauzers are rarely seen in the show ring.","This breed are clever and trainable but have strong hunting instincts. They can become easily excited by small creatures such as squirrels, cats or birds. Ensure to walk them on the lead and maintain a firm but encouraging hand when training. It is essential to train and socialise this breed from a young age. They are a dominant breed and require an experienced and dominant owner. They respond to respect, consistency, firmness, fairness, positive reinforcement and reward. They excel in agility, obedience, schutzhound and are often used as therapy and police dogs.",The Giant Schnauzer requires weekly brushing and combing to keep the coat free of mats and tangles. The hair around the eyes and ears needs to be kept trimmed and their whiskers should be cleaned after meals. Bathing and dry shampooing should be done only when necessary. This breed sheds little to no hair,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed suffers from hip dysplasia, eye problems, joint problems and bone disease. They are prone to cancer, bloat and epilepsy. Exercise: This breed needs a lot of outdoor exercise. Vigorous daily walks or long jogs will help them stay physically and mentally active. When bored or ignored this breed can become agitated. They love copious amounts of exercise and thrive on having something to do, thoroughly enjoying family play sessions. They can play rough so it is wise to supervise play.","('Working',)",Families with older children Experienced dog handlers Outdoorsy types,Handsome Protective High energy Devoted Big and bold Playful
Glen of Imaal Terrier,not available,"The first thing to answer about the history of this breed is: where is the Glen of Imaal? Well, it’s a remote valley in Co. Wicklow in Ireland and this is where the dog originates. It has rather obscure origins, and no one is really sure where exactly they come from; but it is thought that they can be dated to the reign of Elizabeth I. It is believed that when escaping persecution and fleeing to the remote valleys of western Ireland, dog owners bred their small dogs with the local terriers, and this is where the Imaal Terrier comes from. Eventually they were further bred to help hunters hunt for rabbits and rats, as its small size means it can burrow into holes left by these animals. The ability to dig holes is something the breed maintains to this day. They were also (according to Irish legend) bred to perform a very unique task of walking on a treadmill for hours on end turning a rotisserie wheel that cooked meat over an open flame – however there is little evidence to support this claim. Nowadays it has somewhat lost its hunting instinct, but can still perform the task with good training. The breed is still what is known as ‘mute to the ground’, which means when they are working they are silent. If this dog is at a show it should not bark because of this. The breed was first recognised by the UK Kennel Club in 1975. Its rareness in the USA can be evidenced from the fact that the US Kennel Club didn’t recognise the breed until 1997. As the Glen of Imaal is now used by the Irish armed forces as a firing range, there are no Glen of Imaal Terriers currently living in the Glen of Imaal.","Glen of Imaal Terriers are a very curious and hardworking breed. They are surprisingly strong for a dog of their size, and are sometimes known as a ‘big dog on short legs’. They are also brave and spirited and like to go for an explore. They love human companionship, but do not constantly need human attention, so they could be good for busy families – even though the dog would still need a lot of attention and exercise. If they do not receive this exercise then they will become a little aloof and this needs to be controlled. Despite their small size, these dogs are still born to hunt; and will constantly look to hunt and chase animals. They can be couch potatoes sometimes, and occasionally will need to be dragged away from their bed; but once out on walks they will be curious and relaxed. When working they are silent, but if they think they – or their owner (they are a very loyal breed) – is under threat then they will bark. The bark is quite loud and booming for a small dog; and this means that they can make good watchdogs. They are moderately intelligent, but are late bloomers; so it takes them a while to go from being puppies to a full grown dog and become more intelligent","Proper training of this dog is absolutely essential , as the dog can develop ‘small dog syndrome’ if it thinks that its owner does not possess any authority. As such the dog must become familier with its owner from a young age, and realise that it is their back leader – and is in charge. This is also true if the dog is going to be around children. When hunting they are vigorous and hardworking, but when inside they are generally calm and mild-mannered. They can make a great family pet – but children must learn to also hold an air of authority over the dog. They’re not great with other dogs or other animals – but they can learn to live with cats if the cat determines a domination over the dog. They like to dig holes, so they need to be trained to restrict this. All in all they are very plucky dogs for their size, and will not be taken as fools. Having said that, they can make great family pets.","Glen of Imaal Terriers are very small but muscular dogs. They have wide heads, with a domed skull, pricked ears, a strong nose and alert eyes. It’s teeth have a strong scissor bite. The bowed legs are short and well boned. It’s body resembles a Welsh Corgi, but lower to the ground; as this is what helps them to hunt burrowing animals. It’s tail is sometimes docked, but this is illegal in many countries. Their coat, like all terriers, is of medium length, harsh and shaggy; and this protects them against the elements. The undercoat is soft and fluffy.","Glen of Imaal Terriers are usually grey, but they can be silvery blue to tan.","Glen of Imaal Terriers are very eager to learn, so training must be carried out positively and consistently. They are very sensitive to correction training and will not respond to violence or shouting. With good obedience training they can be trained to retrieve. Early socialization with humans is an absolute must to establish the ‘pack-leader’ role of the owner","Because of their think coat, this breed will require brushing at least twice a week. The coat will need to be stripped several times a year. At first this can be performed professionally, but this is easy to learn and can be adequately performed at home. Special care must be taken to the hair around the dog’s eyes and ears, as well as to the hair under its tail","Like most dogs, Glen of Imaal Terriers can suffer  from hip dysplasia and will need to be hip scored by a vet as puppies. The breed in general, though, is very healthy and the only other concerns are eye problems and skin irritations. Due to the fact that the breed is rare and has not been interbreed with other breeds that often, no known genetic conditions exist that can severely affect the health of the dog. Exercise: Glen of Imaal Terriers can be great dogs for those without that much space. They do require exercise; like all dogs, but only a very moderate amount. They do like playing, especially if they haven’t had any exercise in a while and this can sometimes be destructive when they are puppies. They need a daily walk on a lead and must be taught not to pull. If they are constantly ahead on the lead, this is a severe sign of weakness on the part of the owner; and the dog will not think of you as the pack leader. They like to dig, and this means that if you have shallow fences they can use this as  a means of escape. They’re great to travel long distances with, and enjoy a good car journey; especially if you have a convertible","('Terrier Size and Weight: Height:\xa0 14 inches (35.5-36.5 cm.)

They are moderately intelligent, but are late bloomers; so it takes them a while to go from being puppies to a full grown dog and become more intelligent Temperament: Proper training of this dog is absolutely essential , as the dog can develop ‘small dog syndrome’ if it thinks that its owner does not possess any authority. As such the dog must become familier with its owner from a young age, and realise that it is their back leader – and is in charge. This is also true if the dog is going to be around children. When hunting they are vigorous and hardworking, but when inside they are generally calm and mild-mannered. They can make a great family pet – but children must learn to also hold an air of authority over the dog. They’re not great with other dogs or other animals – but they can learn to live with cats if the cat determines a domination over the dog. They like to dig holes, so they need to be trained to restrict this. All in all they are very plucky dogs for their size, and will not be taken as fools. Having said that, they can make great family pets. Conformation: Glen of Imaal Terriers are very small but muscular dogs. They have wide heads, with a domed skull, pricked ears, a strong nose and alert eyes. It’s teeth have a strong scissor bite. The bowed legs are short and well boned. It’s body resembles a Welsh Corgi, but lower to the ground; as this is what helps them to hunt burrowing animals. It’s tail is sometimes docked, but this is illegal in many countries. Their coat, like all terriers, is of medium length, harsh and shaggy; and this protects them against the elements. The undercoat is soft and fluffy. Colour: Glen of Imaal Terriers are usually grey, but they can be silvery blue to tan. Training: Glen of Imaal Terriers are very eager to learn, so training must be carried out positively and consistently. They are very sensitive to correction training and will not respond to violence or shouting. With good obedience training they can be trained to retrieve. Early socialization with humans is an absolute must to establish the ‘pack-leader’ role of the owner Care: Because of their think coat, this breed will require brushing at least twice a week. The coat will need to be stripped several times a year. At first this can be performed professionally, but this is easy to learn and can be adequately performed at home. Special care must be taken to the hair around the dog’s eyes and ears, as well as to the hair under its tail Health: Like most dogs, Glen of Imaal Terriers can suffer \xa0from hip dysplasia and will need to be hip scored by a vet as puppies. The breed in general, though, is very healthy and the only other concerns are eye problems and skin irritations. Due to the fact that the breed is rare and has not been interbreed with other breeds that often, no known genetic conditions exist that can severely affect the health of the dog. Exercise: Glen of Imaal Terriers can be great dogs for those without that much space. They do require exercise; like all dogs, but only a very moderate amount. They do like playing, especially if they haven’t had any exercise in a while and this can sometimes be destructive when they are puppies. They need a daily walk on a lead and must be taught not to pull. If they are constantly ahead on the lead, this is a severe sign of weakness on the part of the owner; and the dog will not think of you as the pack leader. They like to dig, and this means that if you have shallow fences they can use this as\xa0 a means of escape.

    Wicklow Terrier Breed History: The first thing to answer about the history of this breed is: where is the Glen of Imaal? Well, it’s a remote valley in Co. Wicklow in Ireland and this is where the dog originates. It has rather obscure origins, and no one is really sure where exactly they come from; but it is thought that they can be dated to the reign of Elizabeth I. It is believed that when escaping persecution and fleeing to the remote valleys of western Ireland, dog owners bred their small dogs with the local terriers, and this is where the Imaal Terrier comes from. Eventually they were further bred to help hunters hunt for rabbits and rats, as its small size means it can burrow into holes left by these animals. The ability to dig holes is something the breed maintains to this day. They were also (according to Irish legend) bred to perform a very unique task of walking on a treadmill for hours on end turning a rotisserie wheel that cooked meat over an open flame – however there is little evidence to support this claim. Nowadays it has somewhat lost its hunting instinct, but can still perform the task with good training. The breed is still what is known as ‘mute to the ground’, which means when they are working they are silent. If this dog is at a show it should not bark because of this. The breed was first recognised by the UK Kennel Club in 1975. Its rareness in the USA can be evidenced from the fact that the US Kennel Club didn’t recognise the breed until 1997. As the Glen of Imaal is now used by the Irish armed forces as a firing range, there are no Glen of Imaal Terriers currently living in the Glen of Imaal. Character: Glen of Imaal Terriers are a very curious and hardworking breed. They are surprisingly strong for a dog of their size, and are sometimes known as a ‘big dog on short legs’. They are also brave and spirited and like to go for an explore. They love human companionship, but do not constantly need human attention, so they could be good for busy families – even though the dog would still need a lot of attention and exercise. If they do not receive this exercise then they will become a little aloof and this needs to be controlled. Despite their small size, these dogs are still born to hunt; and will constantly look to hunt and chase animals. They can be couch potatoes sometimes, and occasionally will need to be dragged away from their bed; but once out on walks they will be curious and relaxed. When working they are silent, but if they think they – or their owner (they are a very loyal breed) – is under threat then they will bark. The bark is quite loud and booming for a small dog; and this means that they can make good watchdogs. They are moderately intelligent, but are late bloomers; so it takes them a while to go from being puppies to a full grown dog and become more intelligent Temperament: Proper training of this dog is absolutely essential , as the dog can develop ‘small dog syndrome’ if it thinks that its owner does not possess any authority. As such the dog must become familier with its owner from a young age, and realise that it is their back leader – and is in charge. This is also true if the dog is going to be around children.

Golden Retriever,not available,"The Golden Retriever’s roots are Scottish. During the mid 18th Century, wildfowl hunting became very popular among the rich. Scotland is covered in lakes, tarns and rivers, so a dog was needed which could retrieve from both land and water. The improvement in firearm capability soon meant that birds were being downed (and lost) at greater distances from the guns, and over very difficult terrain. Even the best setters and retrievers of the day were not up to the job. A specialist was required. Early retrievers were crossed with the best water spaniels, eventually giving rise to the Golden Retriever we know today. The breed was developed largely by Sir Dudley Marjoriebanks (later Baron Tweedmouth) on his Scottish estate. Golden Retrievers were first registered with the British Kennel Club in 1903 as Flat Coats – Golden, then in 1913, the Golden Retriever Club was formed, and the breed was finally registered as the Golden Retriever in 1920. The United States stole a slight march on Great Britain by first registering the Golden Retriever with the American Kennel Club in 1894. Canada first registered the breed in 1927. Because of the specialisation of their retrieving skills and willingness to please, Golden Retrievers are unsurpassed at this work, which also makes them excellent Guide Dogs and Assistance Dogs as well as ideal all-round family pets.","Your Golden Retriever ranks fourth in Stanley Coren’s book “The Intelligence of Dogs”, behind Border Collies, Poodles and German Shepherds for obedience command training. A mature Golden Retriever is active and fun loving, and their ability to sit quietly for hours in a hide when hunting has the happy side effect of making them exceptionally patient with children. Your Golden Retriever loves to work, but be warned because they don’t know when to stop, and can become exhausted, so take care not to let yours overdo it. Their size and agility gives them the ability to scramble in and out of boats (as well as over garden fences after that rabbit) and because of their hunting genes, they adore water and swimming. Brilliant in obedience trials and agility contests, your Golden Retriever responds well to positive, reward based training. Harsh methods do not work with these dogs, as they are very sensitive. Bitches make excellent surrogate mothers, and some have been known to nurse kittens, and even tiger cubs at zoos, producing milk despite not being recently pregnant or nursing. Your Golden Retriever loves everybody – you, your friends, your children, your other pets, other people’s pets. If it moves and breathes, it will be your Golden Retriever’s friend.","The Steve Stills song “Love The One You’re With” could have been written for Golden Retrievers. They just love everybody, which is what makes them such ideal family dogs. Active, clever, and confident if treated positively, your Golden will happily join in any activity you like, from beach cricket to Flyball, from hunting to hiking. Your Golden is a sensitive soul though, and gets very upset if there is any disharmony in the home. He isn’t aggressive, territorial, jealous or destructive, though, like the Labrador Retriever, he can be a bit hyper when a puppy. They do grow out of it though, promise! Meanwhile, keep your Golden busy running, swimming, playing ball, fetching sticks and letting him get deliciously wet and muddy. Goldens love to carry things around, sometimes a favourite object will be carted around for days until it is a soggy, filthy mess. Your Golden will not be the best of guard dogs, apart from the occasional “woof” he will be the welcoming party to anyone coming to your door.","There are three types of Golden Retriever, the British, the American and the Canadian. A good British Golden Retriever should look balanced and well proportioned. The head should be broad with a wide, slightly tapered muzzle, a brown nose, gentle, round brown eyes and medium sized, softly pendant ears. The neck should be sturdy and the chest broad, the back level and the legs strong. The long tail should be straight. The dense, water-resistant coat can be flat, wavy or  feathered. The American type is taller and less stocky than the British type, with a narrower muzzle, more sloping forehead, and longer legs. The back often shows a slight rear angulation unlike the straight backed Brit. The American type has eyes which are more almond shaped or triangular than the round eyes of the British type. The Canadian Golden, like the American, is lankier than the British, but the coat tends to be thinner and darker than both other types. All three should show a free-moving, graceful and well co-ordinated gait.",The coat can be any shade from soft pale cream to a rich red gold. Dogs from a working line tend to be darker than those bred for showing.,"Golden Retrievers are naturally obedient and willing to please, as well as being among the most intelligent of all the breeds, so training should be problem free. As long as his schooling is done in a positive, reward based way, with no harsh methods used, he will learn anything you choose to teach him. Puppies can be boisterous, and it is therefore sensible to begin basic training early on.","Goldens shed all the year round, with “bursts” of shedding in Spring and Autumn (Fall). Regular brushing every week, and daily during those extra shedding periods, and a bath every couple of months will keep your Golden’s coat in tip top condition. If you notice extreme shedding that leaves bald patches, this may indicate that your dog is not well, and a check up with the vet is recommended.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 14 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, if your Golden does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. Common diseases include cancer, heart disease, cataracts and glaucoma. Hip and elbow dysplasia can also occur, and it is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. Other problems can include patella luxation, where the kneecap slips in and out of place, arthritis and cruciate ligament rupture. When your Golden puppy is young, many of these joint problems can be avoided by exercising for short periods only and avoiding too much rushing around until the bones are strong enough to take more strenuous exercise, after around 18 months. Goldens have sensitive skins and allergies, especially to flea bites are common, causing dermatitis. Haemophilia is rare, but does occur in Goldens. However, if you are careful who you buy from, your Golden Retriever should give you many years of good health, fun and loving companionship.",not available,Families People who like long walks People who like short runs Town or country folk People who like country pursuits,Handsome Intelligent and eager to please Gentle and loving Playful
Gordon Setter,Large: Weight Male 55 – 80 lbs (25 - 36 kg) Female 45 – 70 lbs (20 - 32 kg) Height Male 24 – 27” (61 - 69 cm) Female 23 – 26” (58 - 66 cm),"The name Gordon Setter was given to this breed in 1924 by the UK Kennel Club. Previously, the Gordon Setter was known as the Black and Tan Setter which was bred to be a hunting dog in Scotland. The name Gordon Setter was chosen due to the close link the setters had to the kennels of Scottish nobleman Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon. He is credited as the founder of the Gordon after creating the Gordon Setter breed standard and popularising the breed during the early 1800s while owning a number of the dogs and keeping them on his estate. The Gordon Setter was prized for its ability as a gundog and was especially popular in rural Scotland. In 1842 the Gordon Setter was imported into the United States where it was also a popular breed for a limited time. The dogs which were brought into America were called Rake and Rachel and were from Duke Alexander Gordon’s own kennels.","Your Gordon Setter loves to take a long walk every single day and will become a handful if he doesn’t get this vital exercise. A good walk will prevent your Gordon Setter from becoming bored, restless, badly behaved and destructive and they will also make good use of a secure, fenced garden to roam around in. As the Gordon Setter was bred to work closely with its owner it is a devoted, obedient and loving pet who loves human company and has a sweet nature. Your Gordon Setter will get on well with children thanks to a kind and gentle personality. However, while your Gordon Setter will cherish his owners he may be aloof around strangers and won’t readily trust new people. While Gordon Setters tend to be quite relaxed and obedient, if they sense that their owner is timid they will try to boss them around and take charge over them. It is therefore important to have an air of authority around your Gordon Setter so that he knows his place in the family. Gordon Setters tend to get on well with other dogs when they are well socialised, but won’t usually get on with other pets such as cats unless they have been brought up with them.","Your Gordon Setter is an enthusiastic breed that takes an interest in everything you do. He loves to get outside and explore with his owner and is incredibly alert and tuned into his surroundings thanks to his inherent gundog abilities. Strong minded and intelligent, but with a desire to please his owner the Gordon Setter makes a wonderful family pet for active and attentive households. However, while the Gordon Setter loves children they have a puppy like nature which continues into adulthood and can make them unintentionally boisterous so they may not be suitable for families with very young children.

However, the breed is generally not as well-known as other breeds of setter and is considered rare in most parts of the world. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3> Breed History: The name Gordon Setter was given to this breed in 1924 by the UK Kennel Club. Previously, the Gordon Setter was known as the Black and Tan Setter which was bred to be a hunting dog in Scotland. The name Gordon Setter was chosen due to the close link the setters had to the kennels of Scottish nobleman Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon. He is credited as the founder of the Gordon after creating the Gordon Setter breed standard and popularising the breed during the early 1800s while owning a number of the dogs and keeping them on his estate. The Gordon Setter was prized for its ability as a gundog and was especially popular in rural Scotland. In 1842 the Gordon Setter was imported into the United States where it was also a popular breed for a limited time. The dogs which were brought into America were called Rake and Rachel and were from Duke Alexander Gordon’s own kennels. Character: Your Gordon Setter loves to take a long walk every single day and will become a handful if he doesn’t get this vital exercise. A good walk will prevent your Gordon Setter from becoming bored, restless, badly behaved and destructive and they will also make good use of a secure, fenced garden to roam around in. As the Gordon Setter was bred to work closely with its owner it is a devoted, obedient and loving pet who loves human company and has a sweet nature. Your Gordon Setter will get on well with children thanks to a kind and gentle personality. However, while your Gordon Setter will cherish his owners he may be aloof around strangers and won’t readily trust new people. While Gordon Setters tend to be quite relaxed and obedient, if they sense that their owner is timid they will try to boss them around and take charge over them. It is therefore important to have an air of authority around your Gordon Setter so that he knows his place in the family. Gordon Setters tend to get on well with other dogs when they are well socialised, but won’t usually get on with other pets such as cats unless they have been brought up with them. Temperament: Your Gordon Setter is an enthusiastic breed that takes an interest in everything you do. He loves to get outside and explore with his owner and is incredibly alert and tuned into his surroundings thanks to his inherent gundog abilities. Strong minded and intelligent, but with a desire to please his owner the Gordon Setter makes a wonderful family pet for active and attentive households. However, while the Gordon Setter loves children they have a puppy like nature which continues into adulthood and can make them unintentionally boisterous so they may not be suitable for families with very young children.

Grand Basset Griffon Vendeen,Medium: Weight Male 40 – 44 lb (18 – 20 kg) Female 40 – 44 lb (18 – 20 kg) Height Male 15 – 17” (40 – 44 cm) Female 15 – 17” (40 – 43 cm),"Originating from Vendee in the western region of France, the Grand Basset Griffon Vendeen can be traced back to the 16th century. Bred directly from the white Southern Hound and rough-coated dogs from Italy, there are two varieties of the Basset Griffon Vendeen. While they originally occurred in the same litters, the breeding of these two varieties has been separated into two distinct breeds since the 1970’s- the Grand and the Petit. Cross breeding is now forbidden. The Grand Basset Griffon Vendeen (GBGV) is the ancestor of the Griffon Vendeen, with the GBGV being bred slightly smaller in size in order to cope with the thick undergrowth of the French countryside. Originally bred as hunting dogs, GBGV’s have maintained a keen sense of smell and are still used, as individuals or in packs, to hunt wild boar, deer and to scent rabbit and hare. The cheerful plucky nature of the GBGV makes for an ideal family companion","Your GBGV can be a mischievous little thing, so be prepared for some intensive training sessions. They must be handled firmly from a young age to ensure that they understand the boundaries of family life. That being said they are a very intelligent breed and will astound you with their how quick they are to learn. Willing to please, but very independent, your GBGV has a highly inquisitive nature. Stifled by the confines of city living, your Grand Basset Griffon Vendeen will flourish in the countryside. They are not a dog that is well suited to small spaces and crave the open fields from which they originated. Active and lively, your hound’s energy knows no bounds so you may struggle to keep up on those long country walks. Grand Basset Griffon Vendeens are hunters at heart and will be quick to chase the nearest prey once let off their leads. However, thanks to their superb nose they will always be quick to return to their fretting owner. It should be noted that this strong sense of smell also means that they will require a well-fenced garden and a tight leash should you wish to keep them close at hand. Very social by nature, GBGVs have fast become known for their affable characters. Your dog will not only get on well with you and your family, but also friends, strangers and everyone in between.","A happy-go-lucky dog, GBGVs just love to be active. Energetic and always keen for a run in the fields, these hounds are quite simply made for country life and are in their element when running wild and free after a rogue hare or rabbit. It may seem like they just can’t set still, but they should be sated after lengthy daily walks. Intelligent and always exploring, their keen sense of loyalty (not to mention smell) means that they will never stray from their owner for too long. In fact, they crave human attention so would not be suited to being left alone for long periods of time. Great with other dogs, adults and children alike, their friendly nature makes them a great choice for young families. This being said, their strong hunting instincts mean that Grand Basset Griffon Vendeens unfortunately can’t always be trusted around non-canine pets. GBGVs are very independent and although they always aim to please, they aren't naturally obedient so potential owners need patience and tolerance.","The GBGV is a medium sized, strong scent hound that is characterised by the shaggy hair over its eyebrows, beard and moustache. They are approximately 50% longer than they are tall. It should appear to be a well-balanced, short-legged dog and have a longer muzzle and ears than the Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen. The jaws should be strong with a perfect scissor bite and the top teeth closely overlapping the bottom teeth. The eyes, framed by the signature longhaired eyebrows, should be large and dark with no white showing. The ears should be covered with long hair and fall well below eye level and the neck should be long and strong. The GBGV’s elbows are set close to the body, which features a deep chest with a level topline. The tail should is set high on the body and carried proudly. The coat is rough and harsh on top with a thick undercoat and should not trimmed for showing purposes.","The GBGV can be white with lemon, orange, black, tricolour or grizzle.","While the GBGV is energetic and independent, they are not naturally obedient. They require consistent training and socialisation, especially throughout adolescence and it is integral that they are taught to know who is boss in their family situation. They do need a secure garden as they will be off if they get the scent of small game.",,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12-14 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, if your GBGV does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. The GBGV is generally considered to be a hardy, healthy dog, relatively free from hereditary and congenital problems. Epilepsy has been known to occur in the breed, although selective breeding has reduced the occurrence. Hip and elbow dysplasia can also occur, and it is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. Because dysplastic dogs often produce dysplastic puppies, buyers should ask if both the sire and the dam of the puppy in which they are interested have been rated clear of hip dysplasia. Do not take yes for an answer without seeing a certificate, and ask for a copy to take to your veterinarian. Other problems can include patella luxation, where the kneecap slips in and out of place. Despite these concerns, if you are careful who you buy from, your Grand Basset Griffon Vendeen should give you many years of good health, fun and loving companionship.","('Hound',)",Families Country Folk People who like country pursuits People who like long walks,Independent Happy-go-lucky Energetic Intelligent
Great Dane,not available,"Many people believe that the Great Dane originated in Germany. In 400 AD, Asiatic tribes invaded what is now Germany, bringing with them huge, mastiff-like war hounds which they also used for hunting big game such as bears and wild boar. Over time, as these dogs proved their prowess in the hunting field, they were crossed with Irish Wolfhounds, and the Great Dane evolved. Other sources believe that the breed originated in Denmark, as it was referred to as “le Grand Danois” by the Comte de Buffon in 1749. The Great Dane was introduced in Great Britain in 1877, and in 1899, the Great Dane Club of America was founded.","Your Great Dane’s great size belies his gentle nature. However, he is protective, and makes a good guard dog and watchdog, although he only barks when feeling under threat. While his courage and bravery as a protector can’t be denied, he is a sensitive soul and can be nervous. Your Dane can also be stubborn, and unless thoroughly schooled, and reminded regularly of his manners, can use his strength against you if he wants to go his own way. However, a well trained Dane is a perfect companion for older children (younger ones are at risk at being bowled over) being clownish and playful yet protective. He will also be the perfect gentleman (or lady) with visitors. He needs a good bit of exercise to keep fit, a good hour’s walk each day plus some playtime will keep him trim.","Your Dane is loyal and attentive, and will pick up your mood, so if you are happy, he is happy, if you are sad, he’ll go all mournful, and if there is any disharmony in the home, he will become visibly upset. He likes nothing better than to be surrounded by his loving family, preferably on a big sofa or in front of a nice big fire, where he will stretch out and keep all the heat off you. Your Dane thinks he is a lapdog, and will try to climb onto your lap, or failing that will perch his backside neatly on your knee. One of his quiet signs of affection is to lean against your leg. Aah.","Your Dane should look tall and powerful, yet elegant. His head should be long and narrow with large nostrils and erect ears. His eyes should be dark and round with an alert gaze. He should have a long neck, straight legs with round feet, and a chiselled body with a deep chest and well defined waist. His coat should be thick, glossy and close-fitting. The undocked tail should be thick at the root, tapering to just below the hocks and carried more or less level with his back when moving. The whole impression should be graceful, contained power.","Danes can be fawn, brindle, black, blue, harlequin (white with black patches), mantle or merle.","Such a big, powerful dog needs to be well trained, and a firm hand is sometimes needed. While not overly territorial or domineering, your Dane has a mind of his own and can be destructive if not taught manners from an early age. You will need to remind him who’s boss throughout his life, easily done as part of his playtime routine.","Your Dane needs regular brushing, and because it’s practically impossible to give such a huge dog a bath, regular cleaning of his ears, between his toes and other parts is a necessary routine.","Your Great Dane could live as long as 13 years, but the average lifespan for such a large animal is between 8 and 10 years. He has a very slow metabolism, which means less energy and less food consumption per pound of dog than small breeds. In other words, he won’t eat you out of house and home. Like other large, deep chested dogs, he is prone to gastric torsion (bloat). Feeding a little and often, and not rushing around too much after meals will help prevent this. Apart from his naturally shorter lifespan, your Dane can suffer from heart disease too, hence the nickname, Heartbreaker Breed. Another congenital problem is blindness and/or deafness. Check with your breeder before you buy a puppy to avoid buying from a line carrying this fault. It is important when your Dane is young to protect his joints, as he will grow very large, very fast, but will not reach his full height and strength until at least 18 months, maybe older. So when young, avoid too much exercise and play until he reaches adulthood. With care, your Dane could well make that magic number 13, and give you and your family fun and frolics for many a year.","('Working Size: Male minimum height 30” (76 cm) Female 28” (71 cm). Minimum weight Male 120 lb (54 kg) Female 100 lb (46 kg) Popularity: The Great Dane is popular among lovers of large dogs, but restricted by the need for a large living space. Famous Great Danes: Scooby Doo needs no introduction. Alexander Pope the English satirist had one called Bounce for protection (he was a cripple and a controversial character). Danny in 101 Dalmatians is a Dane, so is Reggie in Lady & The Tramp II. The Hound of The Baskervilles is always a Great Dane.

Greater Swiss Mountain Dog,Giant: Weight Male 132 – 154 lb (60 – 70 kg) Female 110 – 132 lb (50 – 60 kg) Height: Male 26 – 28” (65 – 72 cm)  Female 24 – 27” (60 – 68 cm),"The origins of the Great Swiss Mountain Dog is not entirely clear but it is thought that they are descended from the Molosser, a large Mastiff type dog which was brought to Switzerland by the Romans in the first century B.C. From these dogs, other breeds were created by crossing and inbreeding. Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are almost certainly the result of crossing native farm dogs with large Mastiff type dogs brought into Switzerland. The early ancestors of this breed were used by farmers, merchants and herdsmen in central Europe and the breed was bred as a draft dog to pull carts, to guard and move dairy cattle and as a watchdog and family companion. The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog may have contributed to the develop of the St. Bernard. The breed almost became extinct in the late 1800s but they were rediscovered in 1908 by Professor Albert Heim, who took a great interest in the Sennenhund breeds. He helped to re-establish the breed and save it from extinction. The Greater Swiss was first imported into the USA in 1967 but is still rare even in Switzerland. They were first recognised by the AKC in 1995.","The Greater Swiss is a sociable, active dog that loves being part of the family and has a strong affinity to people and children. They are calm and dignified but they crave attention. They are happy and enthusiastic and eager to please. They are gentle with children but can be stubborn and determined. They can be difficult to housetrain but are intelligent and quick learners. They have a tendency to try to eat just about anything. They are alert and vigilant, making good watchdogs. They are confident and self assured, being stable around unfamiliar people or situations. They are accepting of other dogs and animals and reluctant to bite.","This happy breed is willing and eager to please. They are calm and dignified and have an easy going, sweet nature. They are excellent with children, good with other pets and not dog aggressive. They are extremely loyal and devoted to their family and are protective of their home. They are keen watchdogs who will bark to alert their owners of unexpected visitors. They crave attention and love being part of the family, not being well suited to being confined to a kennel.","The Greater Swiss is a large, sturdy, muscular dog. The skull is flat and broad and the muzzle is blunt. The eyes are medium sized and almond shaped and vary from hazel to chestnut in colour. The ears are medium sized, triangular in shape and slightly rounded at the tip. The ears hang close to the head. The front legs are straight and the feet are round and compact. The chest is deep and broad and the tail tapers to a point. Coat: The Greater Swiss has a double coat with a dense outer coat between 1 – 2 inches (3 – 5 cm) long. The undercoat is dense.","The coat comes in tricolour with a black base and rust and white markings. Symmetrical markings are preferred. Rust markings appear above each eye, on the cheeks and either side of the chest. White appears as a blaze on the muzzle, chest and tip of the tail. There may be a white collar or patches of white on the neck.","This breed can be energetic and boisterous and benefits from early socialisation and training in order to get along with other animals and people. They require firm, consistent training in order to assert yourself as the master, otherwise they can become dominant. They can be difficult to house train. The Greater Swiss is talented in tracking, guarding, carting, competitive obedience and as a watchdog.",The Greater Swiss Mountain Dog has a smooth coat which is easily groomed and they benefit from regular brushing. This breed is an average shedder,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is about 10 to 11 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. The breed is generally a healthy breed for their size and has fewer problems than other similar sized dogs. They can be prone to bloat, epilepsy and hip displasia. They can also suffer from distichiasis (extra eyelashes), lick fits where they will frantically lick anything in sight which is reported in 17% of the breed. Many owners prevent lick fits by ensuring the dog never has an empty stomach and instead  feeds them several smaller meals during the day with large dog biscuits in between meals. This breed can also suffer urinary incontinence and typically occurs while they are sleeping. More than 20% of females are affected usually after being spayed. Incontinence is occasionally found in males as well. Exercise: While capable of being athletic, the Greater Swiss is usually very active in short bursts followed be naps. They enjoy taking part in family activities and their activity level will often match the activity level of the family. They do require good daily walks and as a working dog they enjoy having a job to do. They enjoy participating in hiking, carting, competitive obedience, herding, weight pulling and back packing with their owners.","('Working',)","Singles Active, outdoorsy types Families with older children",Devoted Alert Fearless
Greyhound,Large: Weight Male 65 – 70 lbs (29 – 32 kg) Female 60 – 65 lbs (17 – 29 kg) Height Male 26 – 30” (66 – 76 cm) Female 26 – 30” (66 – 76 cm),"It is often thought that Greyhounds originate from Ancient Egypt, where there are images of smooth coated sight hounds like the Saluki. However, modern DNA analysis has found that the Greyhound is not closely related to the Saluki and the breed is in fact more similar to herding breeds. It is more likely that the Greyhound originates from the ancient Celts in Eastern Europe, where dogs similar to the Greyhound were frequently bred in all sizes. The Greyhound was originally bred to hunt in open spaces where their excellent eyesight and incredible speed gives them an advantage over other hunting dogs. Many experts believe that the breed was introduced to the UK from Celtic Europe in the 5th Century BCE, making the Greyhound a truly ancient breed. The Greyhound was popular among hunters in the UK who used the dogs in the coursing of deer and later in hare coursing for sport and competitions. Greyhounds continued to be bred for hunting until the early 1900s when Greyhound racing was introduced. The breed also started to be seen for its companionship and owners began taking them on as pets and show dogs. In 1928, a greyhound called Primely Suare won the first ever Best in Show awards at Crufts. To this day many owners consider the Greyhound as a loving and affectionate pet away from the race track.","Your Greyhound is a quiet, contented and relaxed pet with plenty of love to give. Affectionate and with a wonderfully sweet nature, Greyhounds are incredibly loyal to their owners and love to be around their owners whenever they can be. A true companion animal, your Greyhound will be totally devoted to you! Despite their history as fast, sporty, racing dogs Greyhounds are very sensitive. They can be prone to separation anxiety and won’t do well with harsh or sever training – a soft, gentle yet firm approach with plenty of praise and rewards is best when training a Greyhound. Most Greyhounds will be good pets for families with older children, however their sensitive nature makes them best suited to quiet and calm households. Your Greyhound doesn’t tend to bark a lot and they tend to be friendly and welcoming to strangers providing they are with their owners at the time.","Due to the Greyhound’s background as a racing dog, it is often presumed that the breed is hyperactive. This however is not usually true. Greyhounds are excellent sprinters and incredibly fast, but they are more suited to short and fast bursts of activity than having a lot of stamina and endurance. Greyhound owners frequently describe their dogs as being couch potatoes. However, like any dog if the Greyhound is not given enough mental and physical stimulation he may become bored and come across as hyperactive or destructive as a way of entertaining himself. For this reason, they tend to be best suited to experienced dog owners who can give them all the stimulation they require.  The greyhound’s relaxed and quiet nature means that they can be kept as apartment dogs, providing they have a good daily walk or run. Your Greyhound may well sleep for up to 18 hours per day and won’t need as much space as most large breeds. The Greyhound was originally bred to hunt and they still have an inherent desire to chase. Their strong prey drive means that they are best kept on a leash and are often not good pets for people who have smaller animals.","The Greyhound has a distinctive appearance in that it is tall and lean. The body is highly contoured and has a long look with a deep chest and muscled neck. The head is long with a tapered muzzle, folded ears and dark, round eyes. Built for speed, the Greyhound’s legs are straight at the front with hare like feet and the hindquarters are muscular and strong. The tail is carried low, curving slightly at the end. The coat is smooth and short.","Despite its name, the Greyhound does not just come in grey. The coat can be any colour including blue, white, brindle, black and fawn.","Your Greyhound has a very sensitive nature and will become upset if you lose your patience with him or use severe methods during training. Treating a Greyhound harshly can cause him psychological trauma, so it is extremely important that you are gentle with your Greyhound when you train him and remain patient, calm and consistent. Plenty of praise and treats will help your training sessions go well and you will find your Greyhound picks up new training relatively easy with the right training methods. As Greyhounds are naturally shy they must be socialised with people, dogs and other animals from an early age to prevent timidness and fear of strangers.","The Greyhound’s short coat is prone to shedding, so a daily brush with a mitt will control the shedding while keeping the house relatively free of loose dog hair. Bathe your dog only when necessary to prevent skin conditions from arising, you may even prefer to use a dry shampoo. The Greyhound’s teeth should be brush several times every week as the breed is prone to dental issues.","The average lifespan of the Greyhound is 10 to 13 years. Hereditary illnesses in Greyhounds are rare, however some Greyhounds have been known to develop esophegael achalasia, osteosarcoma and bloat. The Greyhound’s svelte body means that the dogs are uncomfortable sleeping on hard floors and can develop sores if they are not provided with plush bedding. Your Greyhound is also very susceptible to insecticides including flea collars and flea spray if the formula contains pyrethrin. As your Greyhound is so lean and does not have an undercoat he is very susceptible to extreme temperatures and must be given extra warmth in cold weather and kept cool in hot weather.",not available,People who enjoy walks People who live in a temperate climate Families with older children Couples Quiet households Patient and sensitive owners,Quiet Sensitive Fast Couch potato Loyal Affectionate
Griffon Bruxellois,Small: Weight Male 8 – 11 lbs (3.5 – 5 kg) Female 7 – 10 lbs (3.2 – 4.5 kg) Height Male 7 – 8” (18 – 20 cm) Female 7 – 8” (18 – 20 cm),"The Griffon Bruxellois originates from Belgium and is one of three variations of this type of dog, the others being the Griffon Belge and the Petit Brabanson. Griffon Bruxellois descend from the Sousje, which was a rough coated terrier like breed used as a rodent catcher and a common working dog and pet of Belgian coachmen. During the 19th Century the breed was mixed with the pug and King Charles Spaniel to create the distinctive looking Griffon Bruxellois that we know today. The Griffon Bruxellois proved to be unusual in that it was favoured by both working men and nobility at the same time. Awareness of the breed was boosted by Queen Marie Henriette who loved dogs and became a breeder of Griffon Bruxellois. Like many breeds of dog, the Griffon Bruxellois suffered after the First and Second World Wars. After World War II, only a small number of Griffon Bruxellois were left in Belgium and it was thanks to enthusiastic and dedicated breeders in Belgium and the UK that the breed survived. The Griffon Bruxellois is still quite a rare breed and continues to recover from its set back during the wars, however it is steadily growing in popularity in the UK and America.","The Griffon Bruxellois is commonly referred to as a big dog in small body. Your Griffon Bruxellois may be little, but he has tonnes of character and a huge personality. While he can be loving, affectionate and a wonderful companion he is also tough, self-assured and lively. Your Griffon Bruxellois is very confident and can demonstrate some self-importance when he feels like it! Although the Griffon Bruxellois is a sweet pet that loves attention and affection he can also try to show dominance over his owners, so he needs to be made aware that he is at the bottom of the family’s pecking order or he’ll try to rule the household. Your Griffon Bruxellois will usually only bond closely with one member of the family, who they will be completely loyal and devoted to, but he will still be friendly and sociable with other people too. Griffon Bruxellois can be aloof with strangers at first, but once they have realised they aren’t a threat they will warm up to them. However, your Griffon Bruxellois will miss you terribly when you aren’t around. The strong bond he forms with that one special owner means that he can become distressed when he’s left on his own and as they have a tendency to bark, this can also be distressing for any close neighbours!","Your Griffon Bruxellois is an intelligent and lively dog, so he likes to keep busy. Once bred to catch rats for coachmen, he still loves to run and chase and has a terrier-like personality. Griffon Bruxellois can become bored if they are left alone or not stimulated mentally and physically, so he’ll need plenty of toys, play time and walks to keep him content and relaxed. That said, your Griffon Bruxellois is an adaptable dog who will undertake a range of tasks – he’ll love a long hike but will also settle down for an evening at home on the sofa. Really, he just wants to be by his owners side whatever they might be doing. The Griffon Bruxellois can be sensitive at times and can therefore become shy when meeting new dogs or people, it is therefore very important to socialise your Griffon Bruxellois from a very early age. Griffon Bruxellois are best suited to families with older children who can be trusted not to tease or work up the dog, as he loves to play but is not always patient or tolerant of others. The breed usually gets on well with other dogs and pets, but may try to show dominance over them despite his size. Your Griffon Bruxellois sees no harm in trying to tell much larger dogs who is boss!","There are two varieties of Griffon Bruxellois – the rough, which is harsh and wiry, and the smooth which is short and softer. The smooth Griffon Bruxellois can also be known as the Petit Brabancon. The Griffon Bruxellois’s most distinctive feature is his face which is flat with a prominent chine and large eyes which give the breed the nickname ‘little monkey’. The body is sturdy and square and is heavier than it appears for such a small size. The head is large in proportion to the body with a wide, round skull and black rimmed, dark eyes which are spaced well apart. The muzzle is short and wide and features a beard and black nose while the ears are small and set high on the head, semi-erect. The Griffon Bruxellois has small cat like feet with black toenails, his thighs are well muscled. The tail is set high and curves over the back when the dog is in motion.","The Griffon Bruxellois comes in three colours; red, black, and black and tan.","Your Griffon Bruxellois is keen to learn and loves to please his owner, making him a pleasure to train. Griffon Bruxellois can be a bit stubborn at times, so keep training sessions short and varied in order to keep him enthusiastic and attentive. The Griffon Bruxellois is a very intelligent dog and might try to outwit his owner, so you need to stay one step ahead of him or he might be a bit mischievous! As your Griffon Bruxellois is quite sensitive, it is best to train him with positive reinforcement and reward based training. Harsh training, severe methods or punishing your Griffon Bruxellois during training will only set you both back.","The Griffon Bruxellois needs his coat to be hand stripped twice a year, during the shedding seasons. This prevents build-up of dead hair which can cause mattes and tangles which can be uncomfortable. Meanwhile, a weekly brush with a hard bristle brush will keep the coat looking healthy, though the Griffon Bruxellois’ beard should be combed daily to keep it clean.","Griffon Bruxellois have a few genetic health issues including Syringomyelia and Chiari-like malformation. However, they are a hardy breed on the whole and have a lifespan of between 10 and 15 years. Buying from a reputable breeder will increase the chances of getting a Griffon Bruxellois which is free from inherited health problems. They can also be prone to cleft palate, cataracts and glaucoma. Due to their short muzzles, the Griffon Bruxellois is prone to heat stroke so care should be taken when the weather is warm to ensure your Griffon Bruxellois stays cool and well hydrated.","('Toy',)",Single people Families with older children Couples without children Retirees Urban or country folk,Lively Playful Stubborn and strong willed Intelligent Distinctive looking
Havanese,not available,"An old breed, we are talking ancient, the Havanese is a descendent of breeds brought to Cuba from Spain and could also be related to the Tenerife, an ancestor of the entire Bichon family. The National Dog of Cuba and the country's only native breed. Once known as the Havana Silk Dog and the Spanish Silk Poodle, the Havanese evolved from its role as a pampered lap dog of the aristocracy into a family companion responsible for being a watchdog, child's playmate and herder of the family's poultry flock. This little dog is the Cuban member of the Bichon family, a group that includes Bichon Frise, Bolognese, Coton de Tulear, Lowchen and Maltese. These breeds differ in coat type and character. They are thought to have originated in the Mediterranean area. Bichon type dogs were probably taken to Cuba by traders & settlers and to have evolved into the Havanese.","Happy with a zest for life, they adore their family, bonding closely with them. This is the main reason why Havanese are not suitable as kennel dogs. Their greatest desire is to live at home as part of the family. They will become sad & introverted if left alone regularly or repeatedly for the greater part of the day & so are not suitable for people who work full time. Havanese need companionship to thrive. They are very good with children, especially older children who can appreciate their small size & play with them appropriately. They love their toys & can be very entertaining involving their humans in games of their own devising. Havanese mix well with other breeds. They enjoy obedience training & mini agility or indeed any pastime in which they can participate & be with their owner. They want to please while still maintaining their own individual character. They are easy to house train as they are very clean by nature. They don't mind water & indeed have been known to swim! They will give warning but are not ""yappy""","The Havanese is a bright and lively little dog that likes to think up his own games and then play them with you. It's certainly possible to spoil a Havanese, but they're pretty resistant to becoming tyrants and generally respond well to a little judicious indulgence. This is a busy, curious dog; it is happiest when it is the center of attention. It loves to play and clown and is affectionate with its family, children, strangers, other dogs and pets — basically everyone! The Havanese is willing to please and learn easily, but it tends to be vocal. The Havanese has a classically winning temperament, always willing to please and quick witted. He is easy to train, and has an aptitude for performing in obedience competitions. The breed’s history of circus tricks aids him in agility. Havanese attaches strongly to their families, as they should: their job was always to be a companion. Its true to say life with a Havanese is a special treat. Expect to find yourself accompanied at all times by a funny, friendly, smart best friend who adapts to your lifestyle and schedule. Often mischievous, occasionally naughty — shredding paper is a favorite pastime — the little dogs from Cuba will fly across your furniture, take over the couch and bed, alert you to visitors or intruders, and interpret and adjust to your every mood. The Havanese has a sense of humor and loves the attention he gets when he does funny things. He is a clown and performs all the time. He’s cute and fun, but he’s not perfect. Any dog, no matter how nice, can develop obnoxious levels of barking, digging and other undesirable behaviors if he is bored, untrained or unsupervised. And like many toy breeds, especially those in the Bichon family, Havanese aren’t always easy to housetrain, but consistency and strict supervision will win the day. Avoid giving them too much freedom to roam the house too soon. Many report their dog's favorite spot to be a perch where they can look out the window and announce what is happening outside. Early training is important so that your Havanese obeys commands to cease barking. Separation Anxiety is another common problem with Havanese. They are companion dogs that are highly dependent upon the people they love. People who are not home very often would be doing this breed a disservice. They are best suited for retirees or families with a stay at home parent","The Havanese is a small, sturdy dog of immense charm. The native dog of Cuba, he is beloved as a friendly, intelligent and playful companion. The Havanese is a small, sturdy dog with a friendly disposition. His wavy, silky coat is profuse, but remains extremely light, insulating and protecting the breed against harsh tropical heat. His coat, which comes in all colors, should remain untrimmed. The unique springy gait is a result of the breed's structure and playful, spirited personality. These characteristics of temperament, coat, structure and gait are essential to type. Thanks to his cheerful and loving temperament, he's wonderful with children and is good at obedience and agility. The Havanese makes a terrific therapy dog because of his easy temperament, not to mention he fits onto any size lap. The Toy breeds are small companion or lap dogs. Many of the Toy breeds were bred for this capacity although some have been placed into this category simply due to their size. They should have friendly personalities and love attention. They do not need a large amount of exercise and some can be finicky eaters. A wonderfully happy breed, the Havanese has a unique gait, referred to as springy, that announces his cheerful temperament. He springs along and makes you laugh. He’s easygoing, easy to train, and quick-witted. Between his sturdiness, his willingness to please, and his spinning and jumping habits, it’s no wonder that he excels at tricks and was a circus dog. Watching Havanese play is a giggle. They like to tear around the house or yard and will play for hours with anyone who has the patience and stamina to keep up with them. Even though they’re small in stature, they’re very sturdy and agile. They are also happy to settle on a lap — anything is fine with a Havanese as long as it involves attention.","Cream, gold, sables, tobacco brown, silver, to black and any combination of these colours.","Start training your Havanese puppy the day you bring him home. Even at 10 to 12 weeks old, he is capable of soaking up everything you can teach him. Never wait until he is six months old to begin training, or you will have a more headstrong dog to deal with. If possible, get him into puppy kindergarten class by the time he is 10 to 12 weeks old, and socialize, socialize, socialize. They will do anything for attention, and when training is conducted with positive reinforcement and treats, a Havanese catches on quickly. Harsh discipline will get you nowhere – a Havanese will shut down completely if his trainer yells or pulls.","Although energetic, the Havanese can have its exercise needs met with a short walk or a good play session. It is not a dog that can live outside. Coat care entails brushing two to four times a week. This is a no shedding dog, which means that loose hairs are caught in the outer hairs, tending to tangle, unless they are combed out. The breed's non-shedding coat makes it suitable for allergy sufferers, but regular grooming is necessary to keep the coat in top condition.","All dogs have the potential to develop genetic health problems, just as all people have the potential to inherit a particular disease. The Havanese has the potential to develop a number of health problems. They include Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, luxating patellas, various eye problems, deafness, hypothyroidism, and heart problems. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease affects a wide range of small breeds, including Havanese. The blood supply to the head of the femur (the ball in the ball and socket joint of the hip) is inadequate, which causes the head of the femur to degrade.

Their popularity as pets waned, however, and their stronghold remained in the circus, where they performed throughout Europe as trick dogs. Eventually the breed declined in numbers to such an extent that it was almost extinct not only in Europe but also in its native Cuba. A few remained in Cuba, however, and three families with their Havanese left Cuba for the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. Most present-day Havanese descends from these dogs. The breed has gradually aroused attention from dog fanciers and pet owners, and in 1996 the first Havanese entered an AKC show ring and was accepted for regular recognition as a member of the toy group as of the first day of 1999. After the Cuban revolution in 1959, the breed fell on hard times. A few came to the United States with Cuban refugees, and in 1979 the Havanese Club of America was formed. It has grown from nine members to approximately 400 members, and the Havanese was admitted to the American Kennel Club’s Toy Group in 1999. Since then, his popularity has exploded because of his great charm. Currently, he ranks 31st among the breeds registered by the American Kennel Club, up from 43rd in 2005 and 86th in 2000. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3> Breed History: An old breed, we are talking ancient, the Havanese is a descendent of breeds brought to Cuba from Spain and could also be related to the Tenerife, an ancestor of the entire Bichon family. The National Dog of Cuba and the country's only native breed. Once known as the Havana Silk Dog and the Spanish Silk Poodle, the Havanese evolved from its role as a pampered lap dog of the aristocracy into a family companion responsible for being a watchdog, child's playmate and herder of the family's poultry flock. This little dog is the Cuban member of the Bichon family, a group that includes Bichon Frise, Bolognese, Coton de Tulear, Lowchen and Maltese. These breeds differ in coat type and character. They are thought to have originated in the Mediterranean area. Bichon type dogs were probably taken to Cuba by traders & settlers and to have evolved into the Havanese. Character: Happy with a zest for life, they adore their family, bonding closely with them. This is the main reason why Havanese are not suitable as kennel dogs. Their greatest desire is to live at home as part of the family. They will become sad & introverted if left alone regularly or repeatedly for the greater part of the day & so are not suitable for people who work full time. Havanese need companionship to thrive. They are very good with children, especially older children who can appreciate their small size & play with them appropriately. They love their toys & can be very entertaining involving their humans in games of their own devising. Havanese mix well with other breeds. They enjoy obedience training & mini agility or indeed any pastime in which they can participate & be with their owner. They want to please while still maintaining their own individual character. They are easy to house train as they are very clean by nature. They don't mind water & indeed have been known to swim! They will give warning but are not ""yappy"" Temperament: The Havanese is a bright and lively little dog that likes to think up his own games and then play them with you. It's certainly possible to spoil a Havanese, but they're pretty resistant to becoming tyrants and generally respond well to a little judicious indulgence. This is a busy, curious dog; it is happiest when it is the center of attention. It loves to play and clown and is affectionate with its family, children, strangers, other dogs and pets — basically everyone! The Havanese is willing to please and learn easily, but it tends to be vocal. The Havanese has a classically winning temperament, always willing to please and quick witted. He is easy to train, and has an aptitude for performing in obedience competitions. The breed’s history of circus tricks aids him in agility. Havanese attaches strongly to their families, as they should: their job was always to be a companion. Its true to say life with a Havanese is a special treat. Expect to find yourself accompanied at all times by a funny, friendly, smart best friend who adapts to your lifestyle and schedule. Often mischievous, occasionally naughty — shredding paper is a favorite pastime — the little dogs from Cuba will fly across your furniture, take over the couch and bed, alert you to visitors or intruders, and interpret and adjust to your every mood. The Havanese has a sense of humor and loves the attention he gets when he does funny things. He is a clown and performs all the time. He’s cute and fun, but he’s not perfect. Any dog, no matter how nice, can develop obnoxious levels of barking, digging and other undesirable behaviors if he is bored, untrained or unsupervised. And like many toy breeds, especially those in the Bichon family, Havanese aren’t always easy to housetrain, but consistency and strict supervision will win the day. Avoid giving them too much freedom to roam the house too soon. Many report their dog's favorite spot to be a perch where they can look out the window and announce what is happening outside. Early training is important so that your Havanese obeys commands to cease barking. Separation Anxiety is another common problem with Havanese. They are companion dogs that are highly dependent upon the people they love. People who are not home very often would be doing this breed a disservice. They are best suited for retirees or families with a stay at home parent Conformation: The Havanese is a small, sturdy dog of immense charm. The native dog of Cuba, he is beloved as a friendly, intelligent and playful companion. The Havanese is a small, sturdy dog with a friendly disposition. His wavy, silky coat is profuse, but remains extremely light, insulating and protecting the breed against harsh tropical heat. His coat, which comes in all colors, should remain untrimmed. The unique springy gait is a result of the breed's structure and playful, spirited personality. These characteristics of temperament, coat, structure and gait are essential to type. Thanks to his cheerful and loving temperament, he's wonderful with children and is good at obedience and agility. The Havanese makes a terrific therapy dog because of his easy temperament, not to mention he fits onto any size lap. The Toy breeds are small companion or lap dogs. Many of the Toy breeds were bred for this capacity although some have been placed into this category simply due to their size. They should have friendly personalities and love attention. They do not need a large amount of exercise and some can be finicky eaters. A wonderfully happy breed, the Havanese has a unique gait, referred to as springy, that announces his cheerful temperament. He springs along and makes you laugh. He’s easygoing, easy to train, and quick-witted. Between his sturdiness, his willingness to please, and his spinning and jumping habits, it’s no wonder that he excels at tricks and was a circus dog. Watching Havanese play is a giggle. They like to tear around the house or yard and will play for hours with anyone who has the patience and stamina to keep up with them. Even though they’re small in stature, they’re very sturdy and agile. They are also happy to settle on a lap — anything is fine with a Havanese as long as it involves attention. Colour: Cream, gold, sables, tobacco brown, silver, to black and any combination of these colours. Training: Start training your Havanese puppy the day you bring him home. Even at 10 to 12 weeks old, he is capable of soaking up everything you can teach him. Never wait until he is six months old to begin training, or you will have a more headstrong dog to deal with. If possible, get him into puppy kindergarten class by the time he is 10 to 12 weeks old, and socialize, socialize, socialize. They will do anything for attention, and when training is conducted with positive reinforcement and treats, a Havanese catches on quickly. Harsh discipline will get you nowhere – a Havanese will shut down completely if his trainer yells or pulls. Care: Although energetic, the Havanese can have its exercise needs met with a short walk or a good play session. It is not a dog that can live outside. Coat care entails brushing two to four times a week. This is a no shedding dog, which means that loose hairs are caught in the outer hairs, tending to tangle, unless they are combed out. The breed's non-shedding coat makes it suitable for allergy sufferers, but regular grooming is necessary to keep the coat in top condition. Health: All dogs have the potential to develop genetic health problems, just as all people have the potential to inherit a particular disease. The Havanese has the potential to develop a number of health problems. They include Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, luxating patellas, various eye problems, deafness, hypothyroidism, and heart problems. Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease affects a wide range of small breeds, including Havanese. The blood supply to the head of the femur (the ball in the ball and socket joint of the hip) is inadequate, which causes the head of the femur to degrade. Patellar luxation happens when the kneecap pops out of normal position. It can range in severity from mild The Havanese is a long-lived healthy breed with an average life expectancy of 14 to 15 years.

Havanese are a rare breed not just in the U.K. but worldwide so you may have to wait until a puppy is available. The Havanese Dog Breed has a personality and temperament that is intelligent and sensitive. They crave attention and bond closely with their human companions. Make sure you can be around for them as they cannot handle being left alone for too long. While the Havanese is a watchful dog, this little breed welcomes friends and strangers alike into the home and barks very little so can easily live an adapt to an apartment setting with children or with elderly people.

It is therefore important that the dog has a strong and respected leader whom he trusts to make decisions, if not he may, perhaps unwisely, exercise his own judgment. This is very much a working breed, which needs a job to do in order to remain fit and happy. Because of their inherent strong-willed nature, their guarding instinct, and their extreme intelligence this may not be the ideal breed for first time owners. This is a very energetic breed requiring a considerable amount of exercise.

Hungarian Kuvasz,not available,"This very large, white, fluffy dog is one of several types of large herding and mountain dogs that have spread throughout Europe in the last few thousand years. In fact most pastoral regions in Europe and Western Asia seem to have their own breed, slightly different according to the requirements of climate and inclination. They are intelligent and hard working without fail. The Kuvasz's name comes from the Turkish word ""kawasz,"" meaning ""armed guard of the nobility."" He originated in Tibet, but developed into the breed he is today in Hungary. The breed served as a companion to the rulers of Hungarian and other European empires and was owned only by royalty. Hundreds of years later, the breed fell into the hands of ""commoners,"" and shepherds found they worked well with sheep and cattle. It was in Hungary that the Kuvasz developed into the form in which he is seen today. He is still a big dog but not the giant of ancient times. King Mathias I, who reigned from 1458 to 1490 had at least one Kuvasz with him at all times. He developed a large pack for hunting purposes. The scope of his breeding did much to perpetuate a strain of the breed. Surplus puppies were presented only to the noblemen and to visiting dignitaries.","Despite his sweet looks, the Kuvasz is a tough protector, fearlessly defending his family or home. He is gentle with and protective of children in his own family. He is reserved with strangers; however, he tends to be very gentle with other pets and livestock. He is devoted and loyal but not very demonstrative. Some can be domineering but in contrast can be very sensitive to praise and blame. Devoted, gentle and patient without being overly demonstrative, he is always ready to protect loved ones to the point of self-sacrifice. He can show an extremely strong instinct to protect the children in his life, polite to accepted strangers, but rather suspicious and very discriminating in making new friends. An unexcelled guard, possessing ability to act on his own initiative at just the right moment without instruction. Bold, courageous and fearless. Kuvaszok can make wonderful companions for the right families. Their devotion to their family is extreme. Such devotion should not be taken lightly, and is deserving of a family that is committed to returning the same level of devotion, guidance and affection for the lifetime of their dog.","This ancient and quite intelligent dog was bred to be independent and make decisions on his or her own. As such, the defining characteristics of the Kuvasz personality are the loyalty and protection of the ""flock"" and a headstrong attitude that borders on the imperious.   You will get no respect from this dog for simply being a human. If you want to establish yourself as the alpha dog in this pack, you're going to have to earn that distinction. Most of all, you'll need to behave in a fair and reasonable manner. The Kuvasz is smart enough to know when you're being unreasonable, according to his or her standards anyhow. While many dogs have an overriding concern to please their owners, Kuvasz and other large herding dogs are more interested in doing the job right. If you're pleased in the process then, all the better. They like to think of themselves as the partner of man and are very happy and successful when treated as such. They are typically very good around children and other members of the family, but must be convinced of the good intentions of anyone else. This means that one should constantly have them meet new people (on their territory). The breed, as a whole, is slow to anger, preferring instead to take their time and make up their own minds about everyone and every situation. However, when the situation warrants immediate action, he or she is ready to fight. The Kuvasz is so large that it could easily kill an unarmed man or few, so it's a dog not to be trifled with. It is for this reason that a great many were shot by advancing armies during World War Two, since they actually did present a threat to the life and limb of anyone who wasn't ""theirs.""","Bold, courageous and fearless, the Kuvasz is an unparalleled livestock guard, able to act at just the right moment without instruction and cover rough terrain for long periods of time. One of the larger working breeds, he is well muscled and agile. His double coat features a coarse guard hair that protects a soft, fine undercoat. The hair ranges from straight to quite wavy, but must always be white. Bred to guard royal persons and property in the more rugged parts of modern day Hungary, they've been a sign of wealth and privilege since becoming the royal bodyguard during the Hungarian Renaissance.   They are quite large, often exceeding 100 pounds, and take nearly 2 years to reach maturity. They are known for being independent and fiercely loyal, often to the point of self-sacrifice. They are very good with children but must be well socialized to keep them from viewing all visitors as strangers and enemies. The Kuvasz by far impresses the eye with its strength and activity, combined with his light-footedness. Adults convey an unmistakable sense of self-confidence and regalness, or nobility of bearing.","White, cream or ivory","These dogs are very large and can be quite willful at times. They, like many other herding dogs, are used to making their own decisions and tend to view their humans as either their property or their equals.

However, it is important you don't resort to any sort of punitive punishments during the course of your training. They have a very strong sense of ""justice,"" and don't have any respect for someone who betrays their trust.   Training should begin very young with reward based play training and socialization. This can slowly be made a bit more strenuous, but should not ever include severe punishments. If you must reprimand, do so immediately.

Matthias was crowned on March 29, 1464 when he was just 15 years old. Despite his youth, Matthias was a shrewd and wise military leader. He built a large army of mercenaries that was able to beat back the Ottomans and expand the holdings of the Kingdom of Hungary. As might be expected in such turbulent times, palace intrigue was rampant. Plots and assassination attempts were commonplace. It was a time when a king couldn't even trust his own family, but Matthias felt secure so long as his Kuvasz were close by. It's said that he took a brace of Kuvasz with him wherever he went, even to his sleeping chambers. Because they were associated with royalty, Kuvasz became very popular. Since the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, conditions have steadily improved in Hungary and the Kuvasz has begun to regain his popularity. Today, there are active Kuvasz breed clubs scattered throughout Europe. It has been a struggle, however, because the near extinction left a very small gene pool from which to rebuild the breed, forcing some breeders to use other dogs, such as Great Pyrenees, to continue their programs. Kuvasz were first shown at a dog show in 1883 when Count d'Esterházy, a strong supporter of the breed, displayed two Kuvasz in Vienna. In 1884, the first Hungarian standard for the breed was written. In 1931, the first Kuvasz was registered in the U.S. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3> Breed History: This very large, white, fluffy dog is one of several types of large herding and mountain dogs that have spread throughout Europe in the last few thousand years.

He is often especially polite and reserved when meeting strangers. It's important to start training early, but be patient, as the breed matures slowly. This is not a dog for everyone. They need a firm, but loving owner whom has experience with dogs. Their beautiful looks and soft, gentle expression camouflages an extremely well developed guardian instinct. Their soft facial expression may look like a retriever, but a retriever the breed is not. The breed is first and foremost a guard and they have been selectively bred as such throughout the centuries and millennia of their development. Accordingly, they should be given the care and respect of a guardian. This means that you need to be aware of potentially threatening situations that could trigger the guarding instinct, rather than being surprised by your dog's reaction to various events (e.g. the postman, delivery man, or someone shearing sheep that he has been guarding). They are however, very gentle towards their family and are affectionate and very protective of small children and animals within their family circle. If you want a dog that will obey your every wish, the Kuvasz may not be for you. There are several other breeds that are better candidates and will be happier in such a relationship. They are intelligent and very sensitive to praise and blame. They can be trained for a variety of tasks, but quickly bore of repetitive exercises. They do not tolerate heavy-handed training techniques, but respond well to praise. In general, praise, and encouragement, coupled with earned respect, will give you a companion of tremendous devotion. An awareness of what the dog is and what it isn't must be understood before choosing a breed such as the Kuvasz. Be honest and introspective in terms of what you want and what you are prepared for in a dog. Any dog is a responsibility. A guarding dog is an even greater responsibility. You should be prepared to make a commitment for the lifetime of the dog.

Hungarian Puli,not available,"More than 1200 years ago, the original Magyar tribes swept into Central Europe from Asia, bringing with them ‘Puli’ dogs and settling in the Danube valley, as they took up an agricultural and pastoral lifestyle. From these early times, Pulis have played a valuable part in the lives of the Hungarian shepherds. It comes as no surprise that dogs in the northern Himalayas closely resembling the Puli are still to be found. In Tibet, the Lhasa Apso is said to be a relative of the Puli. The Tibetan terrier, somewhat smaller than the Puli, is also a related breed. ‘Puli’ in this Dravidian language means a certain method of rounding up and driving a herd, and in Tibet any herding dog is called a ‘Puli’","Puli’s are energetic and extremely intelligent, and whilst they are not always by nature a lap dog, they like to know where their human family is and to take part in all they do. Puli’s do not take well to being locked away from their family for hours on end and left to their own devices, day after day, but they are very adaptable to normal family life if they are allowed to take part in it. They do enjoy exercise even if this is in walking the children to school or a walk after the school run has been accomplished. Pulis also need ‘you’ time; time he/she can spend with you doing things that you both do together, and hopefully in activities that will lead to a well-trained and socialised dog. Whatever your day to day routine may be, you need to think carefully about how you can include your Puli in it; if it is not possible to incorporate him/her in your daily activity, then it is very likely that a Puli, or most other breeds for that matter, is not for you. Their brainpower can be far ahead of some other breeds, therefore deserving of an understanding owner who will ensure that boredom does not take over! Any dog that is bored can easily turn into a destructive force.","Pulis are lively, animated dogs who make untiring playmates for children. Their natural dispositions are friendly although they will announce visitors at the door and be somewhat wary of strangers but never aggressive, with them. They are busy dogs that like to make sure that everything they are involved in is being run properly and that all is well with their people and property. This is a happy, athletic and confident breed of dog with a high working and energy drive. As such, it needs plenty of exercise to keep it happy and combined with its easy going intelligence and sociability, the Puli is a perfect companion for an active family who want a dog that they can involve with their activities. They are generally very good with children and develop strong and protective bonds with their family, bringing their innate guarding instinct to the fore. Because of this, they can be wary with people they do not know and it is not uncommon for Puli to growl or even snap at a stranger from whom they feel threatened.   They can have a habit of herding household pets and sometime people; so early socialisation is a must if they are to live with any other animals. As a rule, they make good, solid and sociable family pets when the correct training, exercise and leadership is provided.

Indeed, the Hungarian shepherds have a saying ‘the Puli is not a dog, it’s a Puli. They are medium sized, self-confident dogs that may be discriminating in those they choose to befriend while they become devoted to their own family. They can be vocal if need be and are busy dogs that like to make sure that everything they are involved in is being run properly and that all is well with their people and property. They seem to get on very well with children particularly if brought up with them. Black is the most usual colour seen in the breed but there are also grey (mostly born black so hard to tell if a puppy will eventually grey out), white and a type of fawn colour known in Hungary as 'fako'. Pulis don't get brushed or combed nor do they shed coat; their coats are separated by hand as their cords grow. Bathing a Puli isn't difficult but a fully corded Puli can take quite a long time to dry. The cords fascinate people and make the breed look so distinctive. The herding instincts are a reflection on the demands of his working environment, on the Hungarian Plains he would have been in charge of large flocks of sheep. The Puli therefore had to be a forceful and vocal, as well as a companion and a close working herder and a constant to the shepherd. Very often it is the lovely flowing full length corded coat that first attracts people to the breed, seeing the cords streaming and whirling during the extremely agile movement of a Hungarian Puli - is quite a sight, and sometimes even difficult to know if he is coming or going!! His coat is his glory!","Black, Silver, Brindle, Cream, Brown, White.","Pulis are very intelligent and fairly easy to train if you are consistent and kind in your methods. Training should begin right away; traits that may be endearing in a puppy may not be so acceptable in an adult. Well-trained Pulis excel in agility and obedience. Early, consistent training is essential for most breeds and particularly so for a breed as intelligent as a Puli, don't forget that the little bundle of fluffy you're looking at is a very smart little dog who will quickly figure out how to take charge of you if you don't start training from an early age. They don't like to spend long periods of time alone -they love to be close to and involved with their family so not a breed to be left alone for long periods of time if, for example, you have to be out at work all day.","Their distinctive corded coat is formed from an intermingling of a woolly undercoat with a harsher outer coat. Once the cords have formed the grooming requirements are low, however a lot of attention is required between the ages of around 6 – 9 months when the coat is beginning to change from the soft puppy coat to the start of the corded coat. The Puli requires little special attention beyond their regular trips to the vet and keeping their eyes and ears clean and clear.","Puli have a life expectancy of between 10-15 years and there is a very small amount of Hungarian Puli health problems for owners to worry about.  They are a very healthy, fit and active breed, making it extremely unlikely that they will suffer from any problems.  As with all breeds however, it is necessary to be on the lookout for some issues, just in case they do occur.  Some lines have been known to suffer from hip or elbow dysplasia, two conditions that affect the specific joint, it is caused by the abnormal formation of the hip ball and socket joint.

Take the compatibility test Test your knowledge about the Puli Play our Dog Trivia Quiz Information essential about the Hungarian Puli Breed Group: Pastoral SIZE Height: Female: 14–17 inches (36–42 cm), Male: 15–18 inches (39–45 cm) Popularity: Often referred to as a Hungarian legend, the Puli was practically unknown to the world until more recently, and in its home country of Hungary the breed was so closely treasured by the shepherds that most people in that country were only faintly aware of its existence. The Puli is highly valued as a working dog and companion, and much credence is given to this by the fact that as recently as the last fifty years it was not uncommon for a shepherd to give an entire year’s wages in payment for a Puli. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3> Breed History: More than 1200 years ago, the original Magyar tribes swept into Central Europe from Asia, bringing with them ‘Puli’ dogs and settling in the Danube valley, as they took up an agricultural and pastoral lifestyle. From these early times, Pulis have played a valuable part in the lives of the Hungarian shepherds. It comes as no surprise that dogs in the northern Himalayas closely resembling the Puli are still to be found. In Tibet, the Lhasa Apso is said to be a relative of the Puli. The Tibetan terrier, somewhat smaller than the Puli, is also a related breed. ‘Puli’ in this Dravidian language means a certain method of rounding up and driving a herd, and in Tibet any herding dog is called a ‘Puli’ Character: Puli’s are energetic and extremely intelligent, and whilst they are not always by nature a lap dog, they like to know where their human family is and to take part in all they do. Puli’s do not take well to being locked away from their family for hours on end and left to their own devices, day after day, but they are very adaptable to normal family life if they are allowed to take part in it. They do enjoy exercise even if this is in walking the children to school or a walk after the school run has been accomplished. Pulis also need ‘you’ time; time he/she can spend with you doing things that you both do together, and hopefully in activities that will lead to a well-trained and socialised dog. Whatever your day to day routine may be, you need to think carefully about how you can include your Puli in it; if it is not possible to incorporate him/her in your daily activity, then it is very likely that a Puli, or most other breeds for that matter, is not for you. Their brainpower can be far ahead of some other breeds, therefore deserving of an understanding owner who will ensure that boredom does not take over! Any dog that is bored can easily turn into a destructive force. Temperament: Pulis are lively, animated dogs who make untiring playmates for children. Their natural dispositions are friendly although they will announce visitors at the door and be somewhat wary of strangers but never aggressive, with them. They are busy dogs that like to make sure that everything they are involved in is being run properly and that all is well with their people and property. This is a happy, athletic and confident breed of dog with a high working and energy drive. As such, it needs plenty of exercise to keep it happy and combined with its easy going intelligence and sociability, the Puli is a perfect companion for an active family who want a dog that they can involve with their activities. They are generally very good with children and develop strong and protective bonds with their family, bringing their innate guarding instinct to the fore. Because of this, they can be wary with people they do not know and it is not uncommon for Puli to growl or even snap at a stranger from whom they feel threatened.   They can have a habit of herding household pets and sometime people; so early socialisation is a must if they are to live with any other animals.

If you live in a flat or apartment, are you sure that you can manage to give sufficient exercise. Some places do have communal areas, but may also have a ‘No Pets’ restriction placed upon them. If you have no restrictions, and/or have suitable areas nearby for regular exercise, are you prepared to go out several times in a day whatever the weather conditions? Have you looked carefully at Pulis in all stage of development and coat growth? Do you feel that you have both time and inclination to cope with a rather special coat formation? Are you prepared for bathing and properly drying a corded coat? A neglected coat can soon become foul smelling, and with it can come problems such as skin irritation and perhaps mites or fleas. If you still want a Puli but feel that you cannot cope with the coat, then it is fairly common for them to be kept in neatly trimmed, short coats, but in so doing you will not have the distinctive appearance. If you feel able to take on the regular requirements to keep a Puli fit, healthy, clean and well exercised then it is time to take further steps towards ownership.

Ibizan Hound,not available,"When King Tutankhamen’s tomb was opened in 1922, one of the treasures found inside it was a life-size statue of the jackal god Anubis, the Watchdog of the Dead, and the resemblance to the modern Ibizan hound was striking. The carving and other artifacts from the time of the pharaohs suggest that dogs like the Ibizan hound have existed for 5,000 years, making them one of the most ancient types of dogs. Turns out that supposition probably isn't correct, though. Genetic research has shown that the modern-day Ibizan, as well as his cousin, the Pharaoh Hound, are recent reconstructions of an older type and don't actually have a lineage that stretches back thousands of years. The age of the Ibizan aside, how did this type of dog end up on the Spanish island of Ibiza, from which he takes his name? The Phoenicians, the most adventurous and well-traveled traders of the time, may have taken him there in the 8th or 9th century BCE. On Ibiza, the lithe and speedy hound traversed rough terrain, using his splendid sight and hearing to seek out his prey: rabbits and hares.","The Ibizan hound is an elegant, agile, deer-like hound with large ears and amber eyes that give the breed an exotic look. The lively Ibizan is attracted by anything that moves and will run after cats, rabbits, or anything else that looks like it might be fun to chase. His large, mobile ears are indicative of his super sense of hearing, which makes him an excellent watchdog. He might not bark an alarm, but if you see those ears twitching, you'll know something or someone is around.","With his family, the Ibizan is even-tempered, affectionate, and loyal. He may be reserved at first with strangers, but he should never be shy or aggressive. Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Because they're so playful and silly, Ibizans are good with children. They can be gentle but may chase young children who are running around. They're probably best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. The Ibizan hound is even-tempered, affectionate and loyal. Extremely versatile and trainable, he makes an excellent family pet, and is well suited to the breed ring, obedience, tracking and lure coursing. He exhibits a keen, natural hunting instinct with much determination and stamina in the field. An Ibizan hound grows very attached to his family and is quite loyal but he will still keep his independence. They definitely have an abundance of free will. They are always looking for ways to benefit themselves and that is critical to remember when working with your Ibizan. When training an Ibizan I always like to make it seem like it was their idea. The Ibizan hound is a hunting breed. They where bred to work with the hunter but also to work out away from the hunter (usually along with other Ibizans). They think for themselves and will find the best way to capture their prey. You can see this in the breed from the onset. They are great problem solvers, even if it’s not a problem you really wanted them to solve! Ibizans usually make great watchdogs.  They are very alert about their surroundings and will bark when they feel something is not quite right.  They have big barks and can be quite intimidating to a passerby.  They are a much better watchdog then they are a guard dog though!","The beautiful red and white dog has a long, narrow head that resembles that of the Egyptian jackal god Anubis, large, erect ears that can point forward, sideways, or be folded backward, and flesh-colored pigment on the nose and eye rims, all of which combine to give him a unique appearance. More important is the wonderful personality that shines through. The Ibizan hound, nicknamed Beezer by his fans, is playful and sometimes silly. He's not a touchy-feely dog, but he enjoys snuggling with members of his family. The Ibizan can be reserved with strangers and protective of his home, but he should never be shy or aggressive. A medium-size sight hound who was developed to hunt rabbits and other small game; he was bred for speed, stamina, and determination. Today, those talents make this athletic dog a match for some of the top coursing breeds, as well as an excellent competitor in agility, thanks to his ability to jump high and far. Its lithe build enables it to perform the double-suspension gallop with great speed, agility and endurance. Ibizan Hounds enjoy their comforts--that sleek, sculpted body needs cushioning, after all--and can become couch potatoes who enjoy spending their days sleeping. Their exercise needs are moderate. They'll enjoy a couple of 20- or 30-minute walks or jogs daily. Whenever possible, give them a chance to run full out in a large, safely fenced area. The Ibizan hound comes in two coat types, shorthaired and wirehaired, and both are easy to maintain.   Regardless of whether you want to compete or simply want a wonderful companion, this could be the breed for you. An Ibizan will walk or run with you, love you, and always make you laugh.","Fawn, Red, White, Red & White","Train your Beezer with positive reinforcement techniques such as praise, play, and food rewards. Hounds in general weren't created to work closely with people, so they need short, fun training sessions that will hold their interest. Ibizan Hounds are intelligent and can learn quickly, but they'll become bored if training is repetitive. If you train your Ibizan correctly, he'll be an eager, enthusiastic student, but if your teaching methods are harsh or boring, this sensitive dog will refuse to respond to you. Management is the key to a well-behaved Ibizan hound puppy. An Ibizan puppy is energetic, adventurous, and fun loving. They need ways to keep themselves entertained or they will take it upon themselves to find something fun to do. This could be chewing on your favorite pair of shoes, re-decorating your house with toilet paper, etc.","With their quiet nature and moderate exercise needs, Ibizans are suited to most living situations, from condos to homes with yards, as long you can provide them with a couple of daily walks or runs. They aren't trustworthy off leash, however, and should never be allowed to run free except in a safely fenced area. An Ibizan is an excellent jumper and should be confined by a fence that's at least six feet high. Don't count on an underground electronic fence to keep him in your yard; the desire to chase a moving object will always overcome the threat of a momentary shock. The Ibizan hound can have a coat that's shorthaired or wirehaired. The wirehaired coat can be one to three inches long, with the longest hair on the back, the back of the thighs, and the tail. He may sport a moustache on his muzzle. Whether he has a short or wire coat, the Beezer's hair is hard to the touch. Brush him weekly to remove loose hair and keep his coat shiny and skin healthy. You can brush him more often if you want to reduce the amount of hair he sheds. Bathe only as needed. Brush your Beezer's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month.","Ibizan hounds can live as long as 13 years with relatively few genetic health issues.

They might have remained there, little known, but for the importation of a pair, Hannibal and Certera, by Colonel and Mrs Consuelo Seoane to Rhode Island in 1956.

If you train your Ibizan correctly, he'll be an eager, enthusiastic student, but if your teaching methods are harsh or boring, this sensitive dog will refuse to respond to you. Management is the key to a well-behaved Ibizan hound puppy. An Ibizan puppy is energetic, adventurous, and fun loving. They need ways to keep themselves entertained or they will take it upon themselves to find something fun to do. This could be chewing on your favorite pair of shoes, re-decorating your house with toilet paper, etc. Care: With their quiet nature and moderate exercise needs, Ibizans are suited to most living situations, from condos to homes with yards, as long you can provide them with a couple of daily walks or runs. They aren't trustworthy off leash, however, and should never be allowed to run free except in a safely fenced area. An Ibizan is an excellent jumper and should be confined by a fence that's at least six feet high. Don't count on an underground electronic fence to keep him in your yard; the desire to chase a moving object will always overcome the threat of a momentary shock. The Ibizan hound can have a coat that's shorthaired or wirehaired. The wirehaired coat can be one to three inches long, with the longest hair on the back, the back of the thighs, and the tail. He may sport a moustache on his muzzle. Whether he has a short or wire coat, the Beezer's hair is hard to the touch. Brush him weekly to remove loose hair and keep his coat shiny and skin healthy. You can brush him more often if you want to reduce the amount of hair he sheds. Bathe only as needed. Brush your Beezer's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath. Trim nails once or twice a month. Health: Ibizan hounds can live as long as 13 years with relatively few genetic health issues. Some may develop allergies and seizures cataracts, congenital deafness, medial canthal pocket syndrome and epilepsy.

An Ibizan is generally aloof with strangers and considers himself to be equal in status with his human counterparts. Living with an Ibizan hound you have to have a sense of humor.  They are big comedians and many times will try to do things just to make you laugh.  Even when they are doing something naughty sometimes all you can do is laugh because they seem to do it with such style.  They are very good at keying into how you are feeling and hate to see you upset or sad.  Ibizans also seem to be ""forever young"" and keep their youthful personality throughout life. They are playful and curious even as adults.  This is not to say there are no serious Ibizans out there either.

Irish Red and White Setter,Large: Weight Male 50 – 75 lb (23 – 34 kg) Female 50 – 70 lb (23 – 32 kg) Height Male 24 – 26” (61 – 66 cm) Female 22.5 – 24” (57 – 61 cm),"The Irish Red and White Setter originates from 17th century Ireland, where the breed was developed to be pointing bird dogs. The original Irish Setter was mostly red or red and white, but towards the end of the 19th Century the solid red setter gained popularity became the preferred colour of the Irish Setters. As a result, the Irish Red and White Setter very nearly became extinct. Thankfully, a Northern Irish clergyman called Noble Huston was enthusiastic about the breed and saved it from the brink of extinction in the 1920s, although only a small number of Irish Red and White Setters remained, despite his efforts. It wasn’t until 1970 that a full revival of the rare Irish Red and White Setter was planned and their numbers began to slowly but steadily increase. A decade later, the Irish red and White Setter was imported to the United Kingdom, where the breed was developed as a show dog rather than a working dog. The breed is now recognised by most Kennel Clubs throughout the world and is no longer threatened by extinction.","Friendly, affectionate and loving, your Irish Red and White Setter is a sociable dog that gets on well with everyone from children and adults to dogs and other pets. They are truly devoted to their owners and unafraid of strangers. They’ll greet your visitors with a happy and cheerful welcome, so train them from an early age not to jump on people. Your Irish Setter’s lovable and trusting nature means that he isn’t a good watch or guard dog as he has no protection instincts. There are two types of Irish Red and White Setter, so it’s important to pick the right line for you and your lifestyle. The first is the field type – a hard working dog bred for hunting and field trail work, they tend to be smaller and have shorter coats. The bench type was bred for the show ring – they have a longer coat and have a little less energy than the field type dogs. Whether your Irish Red and White Setter is a bench or field type, be prepared to have a swift, high spirited, energetic dog on your hands. They need daily exercise in order to keep them content and to avoid them becoming highly strung or destructive. A natural hunting dog, your Irish Red and White Setter will relish running around open fields and chasing the wildlife, so a country home is well suited to the breed.","Your Irish Red and White Setter is a highly intelligent dog who loves to keep you happy, making him a fairly easy dog to train. The temperament of the Irish Red and White Setter has been known to vary widely, even within the same litter. When choosing a puppy, make sure you look for characteristics of the type of dog you would like. Meeker owners should choose a submissive dog, while more experienced and confident owners may do well with a more dominant dog, providing they can show them an air of authority. Your Irish Red and White Setter can be sensitive to the tone of your voice, so speak calmly to ensure he doesn’t become agitated or upset during training sessions.","Whilst being strong and powerful, the Irish Red and White Setter is not a stocky looking dog and has an athletic, elegant look. The head should be broad and in proportion to the body with a good stop, while the skull is slightly dome and the muzzle is square. The ears should be set on a level line with the eyes, which are hazel or dark brown, and lie close the head. The strong jaw forms a scissor bite. A long and muscular neck is slightly arched and meets well laid back shoulders. The chest is deep and the ribs are well sprung. The hindquarters are strong and give the Irish Red and White Setter speed and power. The Irish Red and White Setter has a strong tail at the base, which tapers to a point. The feet should be close knit and well-feathered between the toes. The Irish Red Setter has a fine, soft, slightly wavy coat.","The Irish Red and White Setter’s coat is parti-coloured, meaning it has a white base colour with solid patches of red. Mottling around the face, feet and foreleg may also be present.","In order for training your Irish Red and White Setter to go smoothly, it’s is important that your dog is calm and content. Therefore, there are two key factors to implement into your training technique. The first is to ensure your Irish Red and White Setter is well exercised; this will burn up some of his abundant energy and create a calmer, happier dog that is more likely to be easy to work with during a training session. The second point is to show your Irish Red and White Setter that you are in control by giving him firm but fair handling and being consistent and confident around him at all times. If these two requirements are not met, your Irish Red and White setter can become a handful, however, they are intelligent dogs and can be very well trained with the right methods.",The Irish Red and White Setter’s long and silky coat doesn’t need a huge amount of grooming. A daily brush and bathing only when necessary is all that is needed to make sure his coat remains healthy and knot free. He sheds an average amount of hair.,"The Irish Red and White Setter is prone to Von Willebrand’s Disease, a genetic disease which creates a failure of the blood to clot over a wound, meaning that affected dogs can actually bleed to death if badly cut or wounded. In addition, they are susceptible to Posterior Polar cataract, a minor form of cataract that does not usually lead to blindness. The Irish Red and White Setter can also be prone to Canine Leucocyte Adhesion Deficiency; a fatal auto immune disease. Hip dysplasia can also occur and owners should ensure their Irish Red and White Setter is exercised well and fed a healthy diet in order to avoid bloat. The average life expectancy of a healthy Irish Red and White Setter is between 11 and 15 years.","('Gundog',)",Country folk People who like long walks People who like country pursuits People who have a sociable lifestyle Families,Playful Energetic Affectionate and loving Loves to be active Intelligent
Irish Setter,Large: Weight Male 65 – 75 lb (29 – 34 kg) Female 55 – 65 lb (25 – 29 kg) Height Male 26 – 28” (66 – 71 cm) Female 24 – 26” (61 – 66 cm),"The Irish Setter was developed from mixing the Irish Terrier, Irish Water Spaniel, English Setter, Pointer and the Gordon Setter to be the ideal birding dog. They were categorised with a large group of red and white setters for hundreds of years until the early 1800s when the solid red Irish Setter became the commonly accepted type. They were originally known as Irish Red Setters in the United States. When the breed included both white and red dogs, the breed had shorter legs to help the dogs “set” the game, allowing them to crouch low near the bird so the hunter could toss a net over the pray and the dog. In the 19th century selective breeding produced a dog with a pure chestnut red coat and white was bred out of the breed. The English and Irish Setters are both ancestors of the Spanish Pointer but the Irish Setter is probably older than the English Setter. The Irish Setter is an all purpose hunting dog and is both a pointer and retriever in all types of terrain. They are especially good at hunting game birds as they have excellent noses and are very fast. When the Irish Setter finds his game he runs quickly back and forth in front of the hunter in order to alert him. Over the years many breeders have started breeding more for looks rather than the dogs hunting ability. The Irish Setter's talents include hunting, tracking, retrieving, pointing, watchdog, agility and competitive obedience.  With the instincts of a great hunter, the beauty of a show dog and the winning personality of a family pet, the Irish Setter is one of the world’s most beloved dogs.","The Irish Setter is energetic, intelligent, affectionate, loving and high-spirited. They have no guarding instincts, get along with other pets and are very good with children. They can be reckless and highly strung if not given enough mental and physical exercise and may become destructive. They are impulsive and independent and sensitive to the tone of one’s voice but will not listen to a weak owner. They do not respond well to harsh discipline and provided they are given firm handling and plenty of exercise they are a joy to own. Early training will prevent behaviour issues and discourage them from jumping on humans even as a puppy. They are relatively easy to housetrain. There are two types, field lines and show lines (bench). Field lines are bred for hunting and field trial work and are generally somewhat smaller with shorter coats. The bench type are bred for conformation shows. Both types are energetic and require lots of exercise but field lines have a higher energy level and require even more exercise. The dominancy level in this breed varies even within the same litter. If you are not the type of person who can display a natural air of calm, but firm authority, then be sure to choose a pup who is more submissive. The temperament of both show and field lines vary widely, depending upon how the owners treat the dog and how much and what type of exercise they provide. The Irish Setter is used for all types of hunting. They are extremely swift, with an excellent sense of smell and are hardy over any terrain and in any climate, working well even in wetlands. This breed should be always kept on a lead as they have a tendency to run off and can be difficult to catch.","This breed is affectionate, loving and sensitive but not recommended for the average home. They are extremely active and can become destructive if left alone for long periods of time. They require entertainment if they are to be well mannered and respectful. They form strong bonds with their owners but are gentle and welcoming to everyone. Aside from a good, healthy bark, they don’t have any solid “watchdog skills.” Strangers who drop by the house will most likely be wrangled into a lengthy game of fetch. Bred for hunting in the fields, Irish Setters are bursting with energy, quickness and endurance. If you’re a jogger, runner or bicyclist, take them along. Irish Setters will be calm, happy and trainable as long as they have an outlet for this exuberant energy. Irish Setters have a rambunctious personality that’s almost puppy-like—a trait that can linger long after the puppy years are over. Though always full of good intentions and great vibes,","This breed is an active bird dog. The head is long and lean and has at least double the width between the ears then it does in length. When viewed from the front the skull is oval and when viewed from the top it is slightly domed. The body is slightly longer than tall. The muzzle is moderately deep with a distinct stop. The teeth meet in a scissors bite. The nose is either black or brown with wide open nostrils. The medium sized eyes are almond shaped, set somewhat wide apart and are either dark to medium brown in color. The triangular, low-set ears are thin and hang close to the head. The front legs are straight and the feet are rather small with arched toes. The long tail almost reaches the hock, is thicker at the base tapering to a point. The coat is short and fine on the head and the front side of the legs and medium in length on other parts of the body. There is an even longer feathering on the ears, back of the legs, belly and brisket extending to the chest. Coat colors include mahogany to a rich chestnut red. There is no black, but may be a small amount of white on the chest, throat, toes and sometimes a thin centered streak on the top of the head. Young dogs can sometimes have a silvery-gray color behind the ears and legs that usually disappears as the dog grows. Coat: The coat is silky and feathered of medium length. The coat grows long on the ears, tail and chest.",The coat comes in mahogany or rich chestnut red. Black is a disqualified colour but minimal white is allowed.,"This breed requires an owner that is calm yet possesses an air of natural authority being firm, confident and consistent, giving the dog clear rules to follow. Meek or passive owners who do not provide enough exercise will find them difficult to train. This breed benefits from firm, positive training.","Daily brushing and combing will keep the coat in excellent condition. Ensure it is kept free from burrs and tangles and brush more frequently when the coat is shedding. Bathe and dry shampoo only when necessary. This breed is an average shedder and is rather clean, not requiring much coat maintenance.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 11 and 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is prone to bloat and benefits from two or three small meals a day rather than one large meal. They also can suffer from epilepsy, severe skin allergies, elbow and hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism and eye problems such as PRA, auto-immune disease. Check regularly for ear infections and inflammation. Exercise: This breed is not recommended for apartment life unless the owners are active daily joggers or bikers and plan on taking the dog along with them. They do best with a large yard. All Setters require a daily, long, brisk walk or jog to prevent them becoming restless and difficult to manage. Do not allow the dog to walk in front of the person holding the lead as they can become dominant. This breed benefits from three walks a day and does not do well if left along for extended periods of time.","('Gun Dog',)",Families Active seniors Joggers and hikers,High energy Intelligent Sensitive Jolly and giddy
Irish Terrier,Small: Weight Male 27 lb (12 kg) Female 25 lb (11 kg) Height Male 18” (46 cm) Female 18” (46 cm),"Thought to be one of the oldest breeds of terrier, the Irish Terrier originates from 18th century Ireland and is commonly seen in paintings of the era. Irish Terriers were originally found in County Cork, however the exact breeds it was developed from are unknown. Bred to hunt den animals such as water rats, the Irish Terrier is highly skilled at hunting and exterminating vermin. This made them extremely popular pets among Irish farmers who prized not only their hunting skills but their strong work ethic, guarding abilities and friendly companionship. As well as working with Irish farmers, the Irish Terrier was also used as a working dog for armies during wartime. The breed’s courageous nature found him as a messenger for soldiers throughout many battles and wars and provide the perfect example of this spritely breed’s bravery and complete lack of fear.","Some breeders call the Irish Terrier ‘dare devils’ due to their brave and mischievous nature.

Despite his wild streak, this mischievous dog is completely devoted to his family and is a loyal, loving and incredibly affectionate pet. They are highly protective of their owners and will keep watch over their family, home and territory, making them excellent guard dogs.","The Irish Terrier tends to be longer than it is tall, with straight long and muscular front legs. The breed shows a long head which is flat between the ears and in proportion to the body. The ears should be a V shape and fold forward towards the outside corner of the eyes. Some breeders, who intend to show their Irish Terrier, will ‘train’ the ears, which involves gluing the ears to the top of the head so that they form the correct shape as the puppy grows and the cartilage in the ears develops. The Irish Terrier’s nose should be black and the small eyes a dark brown, while the teeth meet in a level or scissor bite. In some countries, the tail is docked by around a quarter of the natural length, though this practice is banned in most European countries. The Irish Terrier should have bushy eyebrows, long whiskers and a bearded muzzle. The breed’s coat has a thick, rugged, wiry outer coat with a soft, fine undercoat.","The Irish Terrier comes in solid wheaten, red wheaten, bright red, and golden red, though puppies can be born dark black and change colour as they mature.  Occasionally there may be a small patch of white on the chest.","The Irish Terrier is a wonderfully intelligent dog, which means that training can be easy with the right owner and training methods.

Irish Water Spaniel,Large: Weight Male 55 – 65 lb (25 – 29 kg) Female 45 – 58 lb (20 – 26 kg) Height Male 22 – 24” (56 – 61 cm) Female 21 – 23” (52 – 58 cm),"As the name suggests, Irish Water Spaniels originate from Ireland. In the mid-1800s, an Irishman called Justin McCarthy, from Dublin, created the Irish Water Spaniel. It is unknown which dogs were bred to create the breed, but it is thought that it may be a mix of the Poodle and Irish Setter, Poodle and Curly Coated Retriever, or the Poodle and Portuguese Water Dog. The Irish Water Spaniel was bred to be a dual purpose hunting dog, in that it can work both land and water. He was also bred to have an incredibly soft mouth, which allows him to retrieve game without damaging it. It was for these reasons that the Irish Water Spaniel became so popular in the 1800s, particularly in North America where it was used as a duck hunting dog. Sadly, the increasing popularity of the Labrador retriever, which was easier to care for, meant that the Irish Water Setter became less and less common and it is now considered a rare breed.","Devoted, eager to please, loving and protective…Your Irish Water Spaniel makes an excellent family dog. A happy, well exercised Irish Water Spaniel is a relaxed, docile pet with good manners and a willingness to please you. Your Irish Water Spaniel may be quiet, but he makes a wonderful watch dog and will bark only when he needs to warn the family about something which concerns him. Their protective nature also means they can sometimes make good guard dogs. A working dog at heart, your Irish Water Spaniel will need plenty of exercise to satisfy him – around two hours every day! His excellent stamina means that you may well get tired on walks before he does. The Irish Water Spaniel will be happiest living in the country, where his fantastic sense of smell will keep him occupied looking for rabbits and squirrels on walks, and where he can indulge his love of swimming by leaping into lakes and ponds. It’s important to show your Irish Water Spaniel that you are in charge and he ranks at the bottom of the family, or he will try to rule the house and become stubborn, mischievous, nervous, suspicious or over protective.","Your Irish Water Spaniel is highly intelligent and incredibly confident. They are sometimes considered the clown of all the Spaniel breeds as they are happy, exuberant and devoted dogs with a bubbly and fun personality. Your Irish Water Spaniel is completely devoted to you and your family; he loves to be close to you and enjoys human companionship at all times. His protective nature may make him a little bit wary of strangers, but it also means that he’ll keep watch over you, your family and your home and protect you if danger arises. Their friendly and gentle disposition means they get on well with other pets, providing they are properly introduced.","The largest of the spaniels, the Irish Water Spaniel has a large head with a long, deep muzzle and teeth which meet in a level or scissor bite. His almond shaped eyes are small and brown, his nose a liver colour and his ears should be long, set low on the head and hanging down. The narrow chest should be deep and the front legs straight. The Irish Water Spaniel’s hindquarters are a little higher than his shoulders. Helping him to be an excellent swimmer are his feet, which are webbed and round. The Irish Water Spaniel has a distinctive coat which is long and full of loose curls on the body, while the hair on the tail and face is shorter. On the top of the head there is a curly topknot of hair. The long, shaggy outer coat conceals a thick undercoat which helps to protect the Irish Water Spaniel from cold water.",The colour of the coat should always be a solid liver shade with a slightly purple undertone,"Your Irish Water Spaniel is not only incredibly smart but also has a strong desire to please; this makes him a fairly easy dog to train as he is capable of learning a large amount. However, they can become bored and have a stubborn streak, so short and varied training sessions with a confident owner are best suited to the breed. It’s important that you establish leadership over your Irish Water Spaniel or he will refuse commands and become disinterested in training. Socialise and train your Irish Water spaniel from an early age in order to get the best from him.",The Irish Water Spaniel is a high maintenance breed which needs a lot of grooming. His coat can become matted very easily so daily brushing is recommended and the coat should also be trimmed on a regular basis. Bathing should be done only when absolutely necessary as it can damage the natural oils in the coat. The Irish Water Spaniel may be a good breed for people who suffer from allergies as they shed little to no hair.,"A Healthy Irish Water Spaniel usually lives from 10 to 12 years. Though they are generally a healthy breed, they have been known to suffer from entropion or inverted eyelids, hip dysplasia and hypothyroidism.

Irish Wolfhound,not available,"The Irish Wolfhound was originally either smooth or rough coated, though the smooth coated type died out sometime during the early 19th Century. The breed was used from ancient times for hunting wolves and the Great Elk which was once common in Ireland. They were highly prized by English noblemen who adopted them as hunting dogs themselves. Irish Wolfhounds were also used as War Hounds, and when the Roman invaders came they were terrified by them. Not that this didn’t stop them taking some back to Rome to use in the Games. Thanks to their efficient coursing methods, wolves and elks eventually became extinct and the Irish Wolfhound also died out too, thanks to the lack of prey and the Great Famine of 1840. However, by 1870 the breed was re-established and a breed club was in existence by 1885.","One of the gentlest of dogs, your Irish Wolfhound is nothing like the ferocious War Hound of history. He never appears in a hurry to do anything, but he can cover a lot of ground with that great loping stride, and needs a good two hours of exercise every day.

The breed was used from ancient times for hunting wolves and the Great Elk which was once common in Ireland. They were highly prized by English noblemen who adopted them as hunting dogs themselves. Irish Wolfhounds were also used as War Hounds, and when the Roman invaders came they were terrified by them. Not that this didn’t stop them taking some back to Rome to use in the Games. Thanks to their efficient coursing methods, wolves and elks eventually became extinct and the Irish Wolfhound also died out too, thanks to the lack of prey and the Great Famine of 1840. However, by 1870 the breed was re-established and a breed club was in existence by 1885.

There is a 6000 year old Egyptian tomb featuring an image of a dog which looks incredibly similar to the Italian Greyhound and they have been depicted across the Mediterranean in art work dating back 2000 years. A small dog appearing to be an Italian Greyhound was found in the lava flow of the partially buried ancient Roman city of Pompeii. There’s no denying that the beautiful Italian Greyhound breed has a long history behind it. In the sixteenth century the Phoenicians brought the breed to Europe, where it was later developed by the Romans. The Italian Greyhound became a popular dog among European nobility during the renaissance, no doubt in part due to its elegant and refined features. The Italian Greyhound was loved by royalty for many years, with James I of England, Catherine the Great of Russia, Anne of Denmark and Queen Victoria all owning the breed. Perhaps the most dedicated royal to the breed was the Prussian King Frederick the Great who, in the 1700s, took his Italian Greyhound to war with him. When his beloved pet died, he buried it himself at the Sands Souci Palace. It was Frederick’s dying wish that he would be buried next to his Italian Greyhound on the 205th anniversary of his death, on 17 August 1991 and they are now both buried there together. During the 1800s, it is reported that an African chieftain fell in love with Italian Greyhounds and offered 200 cattle for just one of the dogs. This goes to show just how lovable the breed can be. Sadly, during World War I Italian Greyhounds came close to extinction in the UK, however they were already well established in America and due to careful breeding in the United States, they are now once again replenished in Britain.","Your Italian Greyhound is incredibly fast and can reach speeds of up to 40 miles per hour, but if you’re looking for a dog which will go running with you come rain or shine you might be surprised to hear that the Italian Greyhound might not be for you. Despite your Italian Greyhound’s speed and agility, he’s much happier inside next to a warm fire or staying snug in his bed, especially during winter. Their short, smooth coats and muscular little bodies mean that they really feel the cold and they hate to get wet. It can be tough getting your Italian Greyhound to go outside if it’s raining! Italian Greyhounds are commonly submissive dogs that are highly dependent on their owners and want nothing more than to keep you happy. They need constant reassurance that you are pleased with them and can become upset if they feel that you are angry or annoyed, so be careful not to raise your voice or speak in a harsh tone whilst training them. Your Italian Greyhound has a sensitive nature which makes him best suited to quiet households. He can become skittish if he’s stressed out. Keep your Italian Greyhound relaxed by showing him that you are in control and calm. It’s important not to baby an Italian Greyhound as it shows him that you are submissive to him and tells him he’s in control of the household, leading to unwanted behaviour.","The Italian Greyhound is the ultimate companion. They are lap dogs through and through and like nothing better than lying as close to you as they can manage. They are sweet, gentle natured dogs but can be timid so they do not do well in households with larger or more dominant dogs. Though your Italian Greyhound is incredibly affectionate, they are incredibly sensitive and often shy, so they are not well suited to families with young children, which your little Italian Greyhound may be fearful of. They will, however, love the company of older children who will not pester them or be too tough during playtime.","The Italian Greyhound is slender, elegant and poised. With a small, toy sized body, the breed shows a sleek, muscular frame with a sinewy appearance. The head should be long and narrow whilst being almost flat on top and the muzzle should taper to a point. The ears are small and folded, and the eyes are medium sized and very dark. The nose should be black or brown, depending on the colour of the Italian Greyhound’s coat. The teeth meet in a scissor bite. A long, arched neck should slope down to a broad deep chest and tucked in abdomen. The tail is slim with a slight curve and tapers to a point. The front legs are straight. Soft, glossy and satin-like, the coat consists of short and glossy, fine hair.","The Italian Greyhound’s coat comes in almost all colours, including slate, grey, black, white, cream, red and fawn. They can also have markings on their chest and feet in white, for coloured dogs, or colour, for white dogs. A flecked coat also exists, though it is not recognised as breed standard in all countries.","The Italian Greyhound has a reputation for being difficult to train. This is due to the fact that they are often highly strung and incredibly sensitive, so they can become upset or stressed during training exercises. They can become incredibly timid if training is done in a harsh method, so consistent, reward based training is best suited to the breed. Obedience classes with a professional trainer are highly recommended to anyone getting an Italian Greyhound.","Looking for a dog which is easy to groom? With the Italian Greyhound, you’ve got one! The Italian Greyhound is a very low maintenance breed to groom. His shiny, soft coat only needs the occasional rub down with a soft towel, and bathing should take place only when absolutely necessary. Your Italian greyhound sheds very little hair. However, their fine coat makes Italian Greyhounds very sensitive to the cold, so their owners will often put a jumper on them to keep the chill off.","The average life expectancy of an Italian Greyhound is 12 to 15 years, however they have been known to live as long as 18 years. While adult Italian Greyhounds are fairly hardy, they are an incredibly fragile breed as puppies and can break or fracture a leg easily. It is therefore important to be careful with them, not let them jump down from sofas or other high surfaces, and to supervise them at all times until they are about 18 months old. The breed is also prone to epilepsy, slipped stifle and Progressive Retinal Atrophy. Buying from a reputable breeder will help you avoid these issues and get a happy, healthy pup","('Toy',)",Active people Families with older children Retirees People with sedentary lifestyles Quiet households,Fast Lovable and affectionate Loyal Timid Sweet and gentle
Italian Spinone,Large: Weight Male 75 – 86 lb (34 – 39 kg) Female 64 – 75 lb (29 – 34 kg) Height Male 32.5 – 27.5” () Female 22.5 – 25.5” (),"Originating in Italy where it was bred as a versatile hunting dog, the Spinone breed line can be traced back as far as the Renaissance, though it could be much older with some experts believing that the Italian Spinone is an ancient breed dating back to 500 B.C. Developed as a hunting dog, the Spinone loves to hunt and retrieve and is still prized for its abilities in this area.  It has been suggested that the Spinone is a cross between White Mastiffs, French Griffons and Italian Setters, bred with dogs which were brought to Italy by Greek tradesman. However, as the breed dates back so far this remains uncertain. It is not known whether Italian Spinones were originally bred in order to create a good hunting breed or if it was a happy coincidence and the Spinone was naturally bred from common stock. It wasn’t until 1950 that the breed was reconstructed to be more pure and refined. Though the Spinone makes a great pet, he’s happiest when hunting and is still a popular hunting dog today due to his great sense of smell and skills in pointing, setting and retrieving.","A large dog with an impressive stature, your Italian Spinone is reputed for his strength and stamina. With a love of hunting, your Spinone will need plenty of exercise to keep him happy and content. He may not be as fast as a collie or pointer, but he prefers to keep a slow, solid and steady pace when he works on the hunt. Even the Spinone’s coat makes him a good hunter as it protects him from water and cold temperatures, which means he is more than happy to jump into a freezing lake or swamp in order to hunt or retrieve water fowl. Extremely intelligent and patient, your Spinone learns fast and responds well to motivational training, providing he feels that the human training him is above him in the pack. Though he takes training and hunting very seriously, your Italian Spinone is a happy go lucky, easy going breed with a comical and clownish personality. His friendly nature means he’s sociable and welcoming to visitors, but he isn’t a protection dog. Intruders are more likely to be licked than barked at and your Spinone is unlikely to attack unless you or your family are directly and aggressively threatened.","Known among its breeders as the friendly grouch, the Italian Spinone may have a grumpy look on his face, but it completely contradicts his nature. Your Spinone is sweet, affectionate and wonderfully gentle as well as being incredibly sociable and loyal. He’ll happily get on with other dogs and animals and thrives on companionship, so expect to have him with you whether you are at home, in the garden or travelling. He may be independent at times, but he has a sensitive side which means that heavy handed, negative or harsh training can upset him. Although your Spinone is generally an easy going dog, his sensitive temperament means that he’s best suited to a household with older children who are able to respect him and treat him gently.","A large and rugged looking dog, the Italian Spinone has a distinct and strong stature with a robust frame. The chest is broad, deep and long; extending at least as far as the elbow. The square muzzle is the same length as the backside of the skull and the nose has large wide open nostrils. The colour of the nose differs depending on the shade of the coat and should be flesh coloured in white Spinones, darker in white and orange dogs and brown in brown and brown roan Italian Spinones. The teeth should meet in a level or scissor bite and the triangular ears hang downwards. The Italian Spinone’s coat is waterproof and should be thick, long, dense and wiry, with a wave to it. The hair should be longer around the eyebrows, chin and lips, creating a gruff yet distinguished appearance.","The Italian Spinone’s coat comes in a range of colours; white, white and orange, orange roan with or without orange markings, white with brown markings and brown roan with or without brown markings.","A smart, loyal and obedient dog, your Italian Spinone is a fast learner. However, he can be stubborn if he thinks the he ranks over you, so trainers must have an air of authority and be consistent, firm and fair in their technique. Motivational, reward based training works best for the Italian Spinone. Socialisation with people and other animals should take place when your Italian Spinone is a young puppy, as the breed can become timid if allowed.","Grooming is practically a breeze when it comes to the Italian Spinone. The dogs have been known to groom themselves like a cat would, and your involvement with keeping his coat healthy is relatively small. A weekly brushing and bathing as necessary is all the regular grooming you will need to do, but every now and then he will require a small amount of stripping. This involved pulling away the dead hair to neaten the coat, rather than cutting or clipping it.","The Italian Spinone has an average life span of 12 to 13 years. Due to the rarity of the Italian Spinone, there has been very little research collected on their health. Though they are thought to have relatively few major health concerns, they can be prone to an inherited disease called Cerebella Ataxia which creates an abnormal gait due to a problem with part of the brain. Minimise your chances of getting a dog with Cerebella Ataxia by buying from a reputable breeder. Italian Spinones are also prone to mild bloating and ear infections as well as hip dysplasia.","('Gundog',)",People who are very active People who love to hike Families with older children Singles Couples Experienced dog owners,Excellent hunting Dog Friendly giant Affectionate Strong Mellow and easy going
Jack Russell Terrier,Small: Weight 14 – 18 lb (6 – 8 kg) Height 10 – 15” (25 – 38 cm),"During the mid-1800s this breed was used to hunt foxes and other small game and was developed by English clergyman Rev. John Russell. They were exceeding adept at digging and burrowing into foxholes and dens. The term “Jack Russell Terrier” was coined after Rev. Russell’s death in order to distinguish the small working dogs from the existing “fox terriers,” which were larger and the breed standard was very broad. Even today, Jack Russell Terriers constitute a wide range of different types. Due to the wide variety of working types, in April 2003 the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America was changed to the Parsons Russell Terrier Association of American. Working types remained as Jack Russells while American show types became known as Parsons Russell Terrier.  Some of the Jack Russell's talents include: hunting, tracking, agility, and performing tricks.","This breed is a cheerful, merry, devoted and loving dog. They are spirit and obedient and fearless. They enjoy games and playing with toys and are generally friendly and kind with children as long as the children do not tease or hit the dog. They are intelligent and can become wilful so they need a firm and confident owner as they need set rules to follow, otherwise they will set their own rules. This breed has a tendency to develop Small Dog Syndrome where they believe they are the pack leader to the humans if not properly trained and controlled. Small Dog Syndrome can lead to behaviour problems including snapping, guarding, separation anxiety and excessive barking. This breed is highly trainable and capable of impressive tricks and are often used on TV or in movies. This breed thrives when given a job to do and as a working dog, has strong hunting instincts. This breed should appear confident, alert, lively and active.","The Jack Russell Terrier is a loving and devoted dog and are highly spirited, lively, amusing and energetic. They get along with considerate, older, well behaved children but are not recommended for children under eight years of age. They do not get along with other pets. Their natural hunting instinct can bring out their aggressive nature but they are highly intelligent and bold. This courage can often lead them into dangerous situations with potentially fatal results. Conformation:","This breed is sturdy and tough. The body length must be in proportion to the height, and it should present a compact, balanced image, always being in solid, hard condition. The head should be well balanced and in proportion to the body. The skull should be flat, of moderate width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes. There should be a defined stop, which is the transition area from backskull to muzzle,but not overpronounced. The length of the muzzle from the nose to the stop should be slightly shorter than the distance from the stop to the occiput. The nose should be black. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with strongly muscled cheeks. Eyes Should be almond shaped, dark in color and full of life and intelligence. The ears are small ""V"" shaped drop ears carried forward close to the head and of moderate thickness. Mouth Strong teeth with the top slightly overlapping the lower. Two bites are acceptable; level and scissor - scissor being preferred. The neck is clean and muscular, of good length, gradually widening at the shoulders. The shoulders should be sloping and well laid back, fine at points and clearly cut at the withers. Forelegs should be strong and straight boned with joints in correct alignment. Elbows hanging perpendicular to the body and working free of the sides. The chest should be shallow, narrow and the front legs not too widely apart, giving an athletic, rather than heavily chested appearance. As a guide only, the chest should be small enough to be easily spanned behind the shoulders, by average sized hands, when the terrier is in a fit, working condition. The back should be strong, straight and, in comparison to the height of the terrier, give a balanced image. The loin should be slightly arched. The hindquarters should be strong and muscular, well put together with good angulation and bend of stifle, giving plenty of drive and propulsion. Looking from behind, the hocks must be straight. The feet are round, hard padded, wide, of cat-like appearance, neither turning in nor out. The tail should be set rather high, carried gaily and in proportion to body length, usually about four inches long, providing a good hand-hold. Coat: The Jack Russell Terrier has a dense double-coat that comes in three varieties: smooth, rough, and broken. The smooth coat has an outer-coat that is short and stiff. In the rough coat the outer-coat is longer. The broken variety is used to describe both dogs with outer-coats of different lengths or dogs that have longer hair on specific parts of the body.","The coat is primarily white (at least 51%) with black, tan or tri-colour markings. Brindle markings are unacceptable","The Jack Russell Terrier can be determined and wilful and require firm and consistent training as they can be easily distracted. It is important for the owner to assert authority over this breed or they will try and take control themselves. Early socialisation may moderately temper their aggressiveness which stems from their hunting instinct. Obedience training is a must and this breed is talented in hunting, tracking and agility.","All coat types are easy to groom in this breed. They require regularly brushing and combing with a firm bristle brush and bathe only when necessary. When showing the coat must be stripped. Like the rough coat, a broken coated Jack Russell Terrier needs the coat to be stripped. It is important to keep nails trimmed regularly to prevent problems and this breed can be easily overfed and have a tendency to become overweight so care is needed when feeding.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This solid breed had relatively few health issues. They can be prone to dislocated kneecaps, inherited eye diseases, deafness and Legg Perthes-a disease of the hip joints in small dog breeds. Exercise: This breed will do okay in an apartment provided they are sufficiently exercised. They are very active indoors and do best in an average sized yard. When sufficiently exercised this breed is a pleasant companion but otherwise can become a nuisance. They need a long, daily, brisk walk and love having space to run, hunt and play. They thrive on exercise and require constant stimulation so are not well suited to two career families.

Japanese Akita inu,Giant: Weight Male 75 – 120 lbs (34 – 54 kg) Female 75 – 110 lbs (34 – 50 kg) Height Male 24 – 26” (61 – 66 cm) Female 24 – 26” (61 – 66 cm),"The Japanese Akita Inu originates from Tohuku, an area in the Akita province of Japan. While the exact origin of the Japanese Akita Inu is not clear, it is thought that the breed descended from an Ancient Japanese breed. Some experts believe that today’s Akita Inu comes from the Akita Matagi, a medium sized dog which was used in dog fights, a popular past time in Japan between the 1600s and 1800s. These dogs were primarily owned by Japan’s wealthiest and most powerful people, who would also use them as tracking dogs on hunts. During 1783 a terrible famine came to the Akita region. The famine caused social revolt which led to many families acquiring the Akita Matagi as guard and watch dogs. The Akita Matagi was soon being bred not just for its ability to track and hunt, but also to protect. These traits have been passed on to the modern day Japanese Akita Inu. During World War II the Japanese Akita Inu breed suffered and the numbers of the dogs diminished greatly. While many breeds suffered during the war due to a lack of breeding programs, the Japanese Akita Inu also had to struggle with famine and the capture and killing of the dogs for their coats which were given to the army for warmth. By 1945, after the war, there were less than thirty Japanese Akita Inus left in Japan. Many of the dogs had been bred with German Shepherds in order to prevent them from being killed for their furs. A mission began to save the Japanese Akita Inu from destruction and the Akita Inu Introduction Foundation was launched to breed the remaining purebreds and return the dog to its original Japanese appearance. The resulting breed is today’s Japanese Akita Inu. In 2005 the Japanese Akita Inu was determined as a separate breed from the Akita by the UK Kennel Club. However, there is still great confusion over the two breeds and they are frequently confused and can be wrongly registered.","The Japanese Akita Inu is independent, stubborn and wilful! He knows what he wants and he’s going to get it no matter what. A dominant dog with a strong will, this is a breed best suited to an experienced dog owner who can handle his somewhat difficult character. A Japanese Akita Inu owner needs to be confident, patient and firm with this opinionated and often bossy dog so that he knows his place in the household and doesn’t try to rule the roost. Despite their strong character and alpha personalities, the Japanese Akita Inu is a big softy towards his immediate family. While he is not usually sociable with other animals and strangers, he loves his human family with all his heart. With the right training, you’ll find your Japanese Akita Inu is loyal, obedient and willing to please. He’s a big dog and needs a lot of space to roam around, including a large, secure, fenced off garden. Your Japanese Akita Inu will appreciate plenty of toys to keep him entertained and long walks once or twice a day to burn off his abundant energy levels and keep him calm and balanced. In warmer climates, your Japanese Akita Inu will also love a good swim.","Although the Japanese Akita Inu is a very independent and stubborn breed, he is generally incredibly easy going and does not become over anxious or hyperactive, except when he isn’t given enough physical and mental stimulation. You’ll find that your Japanese Akita Inu is quiet and calm and doesn’t bark much. The Japanese Akita Inu makes a great watchdog as he will usually only bark when he feels it is absolutely necessary or he senses danger. He has a calm and content presence and can be wonderfully gentle and sweet. While the Japanese Akita Inu is a bit more sociable than the closely related Akita, he still tends to be aloof and wary of strangers and other dogs but will bond closely with his household. The breed is famous in Japan for being a loyal and devoted pet thank to the actions of Hachiko. Hachiko would greet his owner from work at the train station every day and accompany him home. After his owner’s death in 1925, Hachiko continued to wait at the station daily for a decade. This is testament to the love and loyalty that Japanese Akita Inus have for their owners.","The Japanese Akita is a large Spitz type of dog. The frame is well built and strong and slightly longer than tall. The head is broad with thick, triangular, erect ears which slope forwards, and small, almond shaped, dark brown eyes. The jaw is very strong, meeting in a scissor bite. The neck slopes to thick, strong shoulders which lead to straight forelegs. The Japanese Akita Inu’s hindquarters are muscular and stocky. The tail should be fluffy, long and curled tightly over the back. Japanese Akita Inus have a double coat which feature a soft dense undercoat and a long, coarse outer coat.","The Japanese Akita Inu coat comes in red fawn, sesame, white and brindle with a white shade on the cheeks, muzzle, inside of the legs and under the chest, body, neck and tail. Black markings are not allowed in the show ring.","Due to the Japanese Akita Inu’s stubborn and independent nature, they can be difficult to train. It is important to thoroughly train and socialise them from an early age in order to prevent behaviour problems later in life. They need an owner who has an air of confidence and will not let the dog think that he is in charge. Positive, reward based training with a firm yet fair attitude is the best method for training your Japanese Akita Inu.","The Japanese Akita Inu does not need to be professionally clipped or timed, however they do go through heavy shedding twice per year, during which they blow their undercoat. It is particularly important to brush your Japanese Akita Inu at least once per day during these periods in order to control the shedding and minimise mess. At other times of the year a weekly brush will suffice in order to ensure the coat is healthy and tangle free. Bathing should take place only when necessary as it can damage the Japanese Akita Inu’s water resistant coat.","The Japanese Akita Inu comes from a small gene pool after the breed was nearly wiped out during the Second World War. The breed is therefore prone to some hereditary diseases including hypothyroid, autoimmune thyroiditis, hip dysplasia and entropion patella as well as knee trouble. The average lifespan of a Japanese Akita Inu is 11 to 15 years.","('Utility',)",Experienced dog owners Country folk Couples without children People who like long walks Hikers and ramblers,Stubborn Independent Loyal Protective Quiet

Japanese Shibu Inu,"Japanese Shiba Inus are medium sized dogs with an average height from floor to withers of 14 inches to 16 inches (35–43 cm) for males and 13 inches to 15 inches (33–41 cm). In terms of weight the average is approximately 23 pounds (10 kg) for males, 17 pounds (8 kg) for females.","The Japanese Shiba Inu is one of very few ancient breeds of dog still in existence. It is thought that its history can be traced back to at least 7000BC when the earliest immigrants arrived to the islands of Japan with a small type of dog. Archaeological evidence has been found of the breed being depicted on clay pots and terracotta remains. Around 3rd century BC, new immigrants arrived in Japan with other dogs and these interbred with those already there, creating canines with curly tails and pointy ears. The modern Japanese Shiba Inu. The breed was originally used to hunt small game, such as hares, pheasants and foxes. There were originally three different types of Shiba Inu, each named after the region of Japan they came from. These were the Shinshu Shiba from the Nagano region, the Mino Shiba from the Gifu region and the Sanin Shiba from the main land (the Sanin area of the island of Honshu). The second world war proved nearly catastrophic for the breed, but efforts were made to preserve it by breeding dogs in the less war torn areas of the countryside. The dog was also introduced to the United States as a result of US troops stationed there bringing them home. The dog was introduced to the UK in 1985.","Much like the smaller Japanese Chin, Shiba Inus often display cat like behaviour, sometimes even rubbing up against owner’s legs and almost purring when stroked. They do however, like to chase balls and play just like any other dog; and are sometimes known as ‘big, small’ dogs as they enjoy playing rough and tumble. They are very clean when out and around the house, and like to wash and preen themselves. The dog is generally intelligent, but much like other small dog breeds, some owners may find training difficult. As a result of this it is important that obedience training is introduced from a young age, especially to hone the instinctive hunting recall. They will not react at all well to harsh training methods or even when there is a negative mood. They are perhaps not the best dogs to train for obedience training or for any other dog sports, such as agility. Altogether they are very bold and good natured dogs.","Shiba Inus are not the easiest dogs to train and can often be stubborn. Females can even become aggressive due to the a driving hunting instinct. As a result of this the dog should always be kept on a lead. They do make family pets in Japan, but they are probably not best for families with young children, as they can become aloof and dominant. A dominant ‘I am in charge’ attitude is essential when training this type of dog as they will always look to become the pack leader, and will do this if they live with other animals or other breeds of dogs. This can cause conflict, especially if the other breeds are larger than the Shiba Inu. Generally though, aggressiveness is rare, and they are mostly calm and gentle dogs.  A distinguishing characteristic of the breed is the so-called ""shiba scream"". When sufficiently provoked or unhappy, the dog will produce a loud, high pitched scream. This can occur when attempting to handle the dog in a way that it deems unacceptable. The dog may also emit a very similar sound during periods of great joy, such as the return of the owner after an extended absence, or the arrival of a favoured human guest.","The Shiba Inu's frame is compact with well-developed muscles. It is double coated with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick (this can make grooming difficult). Fur is short and even on the fox-like face, ears, and legs. The dark eyes express a sharp intelligence and the ears are triangular and stand erect on top of the head. The body of this small to medium sized dog is strong and athletic with it being made to spend time running through dense bush and scrub. The legs are strong and straight, as is the back which is shaped into the traditional curled tail, which is carried high over the back.","Shiba Inus may be red, black and tan, with a cream, buff, or grey undercoat.","Training a Shiba Inu can be fun, but they are very stubborn dogs, and this can make training difficult. Recall and general obedience training is vital from a young age as the dog will be a struggle to train when older. They are quite difficult to teach tricks. They are however relatively easy to house-train because of their fastidious attitudes toward cleanliness, sometimes they will simply learn to housetrain themselves. Harsh training methods should never be used as the dog simply will not respond to them.","These dogs moult a lot, and as a result are not hypoallergenic, however they do not need to be groomed all that often as they tend to take care of themselves.

They have also been featured in many Japanese films. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>
    Japanese Shiba Inus are also known as the Japanese Small Size dog and the Shiba Ken. Breed History: The Japanese Shiba Inu is one of very few ancient breeds of dog still in existence. It is thought that its history can be traced back to at least 7000BC when the earliest immigrants arrived to the islands of Japan with a small type of dog. Archaeological evidence has been found of the breed being depicted on clay pots and terracotta remains. Around 3rd century BC, new immigrants arrived in Japan with other dogs and these interbred with those already there, creating canines with curly tails and pointy ears. The modern Japanese Shiba Inu. The breed was originally used to hunt small game, such as hares, pheasants and foxes. There were originally three different types of Shiba Inu, each named after the region of Japan they came from. These were the Shinshu Shiba from the Nagano region, the Mino Shiba from the Gifu region and the Sanin Shiba from the main land (the Sanin area of the island of Honshu). The second world war proved nearly catastrophic for the breed, but efforts were made to preserve it by breeding dogs in the less war torn areas of the countryside. The dog was also introduced to the United States as a result of US troops stationed there bringing them home. The dog was introduced to the UK in 1985. Character: Much like the smaller Japanese Chin, Shiba Inus often display cat like behaviour, sometimes even rubbing up against owner’s legs and almost purring when stroked. They do however, like to chase balls and play just like any other dog; and are sometimes known as ‘big, small’ dogs as they enjoy playing rough and tumble. They are very clean when out and around the house, and like to wash and preen themselves. The dog is generally intelligent, but much like other small dog breeds, some owners may find training difficult. As a result of this it is important that obedience training is introduced from a young age, especially to hone the instinctive hunting recall. They will not react at all well to harsh training methods or even when there is a negative mood. They are perhaps not the best dogs to train for obedience training or for any other dog sports, such as agility. Altogether they are very bold and good natured dogs. Temperament: Shiba Inus are not the easiest dogs to train and can often be stubborn. Females can even become aggressive due to the a driving hunting instinct. As a result of this the dog should always be kept on a lead. They do make family pets in Japan, but they are probably not best for families with young children, as they can become aloof and dominant. A dominant ‘I am in charge’ attitude is essential when training this type of dog as they will always look to become the pack leader, and will do this if they live with other animals or other breeds of dogs. This can cause conflict, especially if the other breeds are larger than the Shiba Inu. Generally though, aggressiveness is rare, and they are mostly calm and gentle dogs.  A distinguishing characteristic of the breed is the so-called ""shiba scream"". When sufficiently provoked or unhappy, the dog will produce a loud, high pitched scream. This can occur when attempting to handle the dog in a way that it deems unacceptable. The dog may also emit a very similar sound during periods of great joy, such as the return of the owner after an extended absence, or the arrival of a favoured human guest. Conformation: The Shiba Inu's frame is compact with well-developed muscles. It is double coated with the outer coat being stiff and straight and the undercoat soft and thick (this can make grooming difficult). Fur is short and even on the fox-like face, ears, and legs. The dark eyes express a sharp intelligence and the ears are triangular and stand erect on top of the head. The body of this small to medium sized dog is strong and athletic with it being made to spend time running through dense bush and scrub. The legs are strong and straight, as is the back which is shaped into the traditional curled tail, which is carried high over the back. Colour: Shiba Inus may be red, black and tan, with a cream, buff, or grey undercoat. Training: Training a Shiba Inu can be fun, but they are very stubborn dogs, and this can make training difficult. Recall and general obedience training is vital from a young age as the dog will be a struggle to train when older. They are quite difficult to teach tricks. They are however relatively easy to house-train because of their fastidious attitudes toward cleanliness, sometimes they will simply learn to housetrain themselves. Harsh training methods should never be used as the dog simply will not respond to them. Care: These dogs moult a lot, and as a result are not hypoallergenic, however they do not need to be groomed all that often as they tend to take care of themselves. Their inner coat is naturally waterproof, so there’s no real reason to bathe them. They will need an odd brush now and then to keep the coat in check; especially when they are shedding during the summer. Health: Shib Inus are a generally healthy and hardy breed. They can sometimes be prone to eye infections, so regular checks of the eyes , ears and nose are absolutely essential. Puppies should be hip scored by a vet to check for any future potential issues with hip dysplasia.Exercise: Shiba Inus need to be exercised daily, just like any other dog. They can make great jogging partners; but they must be kept on the lead. Shiba Inus live on average  12-15 years. A Shiba Inu was the world’s oldest dog until it died in 2011. It lived until the ripe old age of 26.

The dog also bares something of a resemblance to the to the American Eskimo Spitz type. Wherever they originated, the breed was recognised by the UK Kennel Club in 1981. Like most Japanese dog breeds, the onset of the Second World War threatened them, but the breed suddenly became popular in the 1950s (as a fluffy and cuddly dog)  and thus this saed it from extinction.","The Japanese Spitz is, in spirit, a big dog in a little dog's body.  This tough little dog acts as a house protector and guardian. The Japanese Spitz can be an inveterate barker if you allow them to believe they are in charge but be sure to tell the dog enough is enough and to quiet down if he starts barking obsessively. Japanese Spitz are typical of most small dog breeds. This means that they have plenty of energy, and will enjoy chasing things and being used as a jogging partner. They also enjoy plenty of ‘rough and tumble’  play time, but they are not aggressive. They are pretty, alert and high spirited; and very suited to the show ring.

These are not Spitz traits, but rather behaviours resulting in a lack of leadership on the humans part. All of these traits are signs of a badly trained dog. They breed is great with older children, and certainly will not see them, or younger children as a threat. But, having said that, children need to exert the same dominance over the dog that adults do, so they are perhaps not best suited to families with very small children. The breed is very intelligent.

But the coat also has a feature that means that it is non-stick, and waterproof; it is often compared with substance Teflon, which you will find is the non-stick coating on many pots and pans used in your kitchen. As a result the coat will need to be brushed and combed regularly.  When the dog is shedding (and this occurs a lot when they are in season), use a comb with a double row of metal teeth to remove loose hairs from the under-layer.

Keeshond,Height: Dogs 17-19 inches (44-48cm.) Females are 10% less. Weight: some sources say 55-66 pounds (25-30kg.) while others say 35-45 pounds (15-20 kg.),"Being a dog of the Spitz type, the breed holds a similar lineage to the Samoyed, Chow Chow, Finnish Spitz, Norwegian Elkhound, and Pomeranian. The dog is of Artic origin (hence the thick, fluffy coat) and dates back to the 18th century. Their sole purpose was that of a popular family pet, and they never were bred to become working dogs. They have a strong historical relationship with the Netherlands, and became a symbol of the country’s independence parties during the French Revolutionary wars. Keeshonden became a mascot for these patriots. When the rebellion(against the Dutch royal family) failed, the Keeshond suffered a serious drop in popularity. A small group of diehards maintained the breed and, years later, the Keeshond returned to popularity.

King Charles Spaniel,not available,"The original King Charles Spaniels were made famous by their association with Charles II of England (1630–1685) who adored small dogs. However they have been linked with English royalty since the time of Mary Tudor (1516–1558). In many17th-century paintings, these elegant canines sit on the laps of princes and princesses. Over the years, the breed evolved, creating a diversity of types that did not resemble the original. An American dog breeder named Roswell Eldridge went to England in the1920s to find several of the classic King Charles Spaniels. Finding few options, he offered a prize for the best female and male breeds shown at the annual ‘Crufts’ show. This sparked a new interest in King Charles Spaniels, but they did not receive American Kennel Club recognition until 1996. It is thought that the toy spaniels that eventually became the King Charles spaniel originated in the Far East, primarily Japan. They may share a common ancestry with the Pekingese and Japanese Chin. Toy spaniels were given as gifts to European royalty. Historically the breeds that were merged into the King Charles spaniel were used for hunting; due to their stature they were not well suited. They have kept their hunting instincts, but do not exhibit high energy and are better suited to being lapdogs.","The English Toy-Spaniel is gentle, happy, playful, loving and sweet. The breed is intelligent and naturally well behaved. They will be quiet and laidback if treated gently, but firmly. They are friendly with other dogs. They will be good with all children if both owners and children are clear pack leaders towards the dog. It is an average barker, and is an okay watchdog.

This can cause a wide, varying degree of behaviour issues including, but not limited to acting timid, demanding, wilfulness and possible obsessive barking. If you allow things to escalate even higher they may begin to guard objects and or become untrustworthy with children and/or strange adults.","The Breed Standard describes their temperament as ""reserved, gentle and affectionate"" and whilst they are excellent companions they will need plenty of socialization in order to help them grow into a balanced character that doesn't fright too easily.

They are very good playmates for children, being patient and playful, and make a good first impression with strangers. Some can be a little reserved with new people, but they quickly warm up. For this reason, the King Charles is probably not the best choice for a watchdog. Though it may still bark to warn its owners of an approaching visitor.

The black nose is large with wide nostrils. The square jaw is large and deep with a slight under bite. The large eyes are dark brown or black with black eye rims. The ears are very long, hanging close to the head with heavy feathering. The ears should not have a lot of white on them. They have long necks, sloping shoulders and straight forelegs. Their wagging tails are covered in fur and are not carried too high.","Colour: The ""King Charles"" black and tan markings typically consist of a black coat with mahogany/tan markings on the face, legs and chest and under the tail.",,"This breed needs daily brushing, ear cleaning and occasional grooming. They are average shedders but no trimming or stripping is needed. It is important to keep their eyes and ears clean and free of debris and hair. When walking this dog it must be made to heel beside or behind the human. Never in front, as in a dog's mind the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human and NOT the dog.  Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs, however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfil their primal instinct to walk. Dogs who do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display a wide array of behaviour problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large fenced in yard.

Compared to other breeds, the King Charles spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which may be associated with cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia.

The round, head is large in proportion to the dog. The muzzle is very short, with a pushed back nose and extra skin under the eyes. The stop is deep and well defined. The black nose is large with wide nostrils. The square jaw is large and deep with a slight under bite. The large eyes are dark brown or black with black eye rims. The ears are very long, hanging close to the head with heavy feathering. The ears should not have a lot of white on them. They have long necks, sloping shoulders and straight forelegs. Their wagging tails are covered in fur and are not carried too high. Colour: Colour: The ""King Charles"" black and tan markings typically consist of a black coat with mahogany/tan markings on the face, legs and chest and under the tail. Training: Care: This breed needs daily brushing, ear cleaning and occasional grooming. They are average shedders but no trimming or stripping is needed. It is important to keep their eyes and ears clean and free of debris and hair. When walking\xa0this dog it must be made to heel beside or behind the human. Never in front, as in a dog\'s mind the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human and NOT the dog.\xa0 Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs, however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfil their primal instinct to walk. Dogs who do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display a wide array of behaviour problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large fenced in yard. Don\'t think that just because he is small he should be confined to a small space. However they are good for apartment life, relatively inactive indoors, and will do okay without a yard if they are sufficiently exercised. English Toy Spaniels do not do well in temperature extremes. Being people-oriented dogs, King Charles Spaniels crave companionship and attention, rewarding their owners with equal amounts of affection. Don’t ignore them or leave them alone for too long: They can get depressed, lonely and sometimes batty Health: Common health problems include a heart condition called mitral valve disease, hip dysplasia and ear infections. The King Charles is also likely to suffer some sort of breathing difficulty due to its compact muzzle. Their eyes and ears are also areas to keep close attention on as they can develop infections quite rapidly. Health issues relating to the eyes include cataracts, distichia, entropion, microphthalmia, optic disc drusen, and keratitis. Compared to other breeds, the King Charles spaniel has an increased risk of distichia (where extra eyelashes or hairs cause irritation to the eye). Inheritance is suspected in the other conditions, with ages of onset ranging from six months for cataracts to two to five years for corneal dystrophy. Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which may be associated with cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. A healthy breed can live as long as 14 years but averages at 10 years.

Kooikerhondje,not available,"This rare breed originated in the Netherlands in the 1500s. Kooikerhondje's were used to decoy in hunt ducks. The Kooikerhondje was developed in the Netherlands around the sixteenth century to be a tolling breed. They were used to lure and drive ducks into 'kooien' (cages in the form of canals with traps at the ends), where the hunter (the so called Kooiker) could easily catch the fowl. The dogs that were used by the Kooiker for this kind of hunting technique, were referred to as the 'Kooiker's hondjes' (literally: Kooiker's dogs). Eventually this led to this dog being called Kooikerhondje. The Kooikerhondje loves water and is an adept swimmer due to their original role luring ducks into traps for hunters along the Dutch waterways. They suffered terribly during the ravages of WWII, almost heading into extinction until the breed was carefully resurrected. In 1943 Baroness von Hardenbrock van Ammerstol began the arduous task of reviving the breed. Today they remain extremely rare and difficult to obtain. The breed was only officially recognized by the Dutch Kennel Club, in 1971 and has since been imported into other countries and recognised officially. The breed is still relatively unknown in North America and not yet recognized as a breed in the USA or Canada. In the UK, the breed has been removed from the import list and is now eligible to enter Crufts for the Best in Show award, despite there being only 76 of the breed in the UK. Some historians believe the Kooikerhondje may have possibly played a part in the development of the Nova Scotia Duck-Tolling Retriever.","They are brave, versatile, and alert. The Kooikerhondje breed is highly adept at flushing and retrieving fowl. The Kooikerhondje breed is lively, attentive, and good-natured. They are not recommended for homes with small or loud, boisterous children. They bond closely to their family and are reserved with strangers. The Kooikerhondje will do well with other pets they have been raised with. They make an excellent hunting companion or delightful family pet.","The Kooikerhondje adapts to situations rather quickly, changing his behaviour from quiet to lively when the situation allows him to be. He will not always immediately like strangers, instead choosing to retreat. But once he warms up to someone, the trust will be there for the rest of his life. The Kooikerhondje can become quite reliant on its domestic environment.","Seldom seen outside the Netherlands, the Kooikerhondje is a medium sized dog that has the appearance of a Spaniel or Setter. They have medium long, hanging ears with wispy tips, known as earrings, that are set close to the head and they have long, feathered tails with a white plume. The breed has a waterproof, medium long coat that doesn't hold much dirt and is easily cleaned by a simple brushing.The fur is medium long and either slightly wavy or straight These dogs are around). They have shiny bicoloured coats that can take up to 2 years to mature, often predominantly white with orange-red plates.",Colours include white and red or orange and white. The red or orange is typically present in patches. The ears are tipped in black and the face is white blazed.,"The Kooikerhondje is exceedingly sensitive and does not respond to loud, harsh, or heavy-handed methods. Training must be done with kindness, fairness, patience, and consistency.","Kooikerhondje's require occasional brushing. Bathing should only be done when absolutely necessary. It is important to regularly check and clean the ears. If you aren't able to offer the Kooikerhondje enough exercise you'll need to keep a close eye on how much food they are consuming, as they are prone to weight gain. They require moderate exercise and short runs are ideal. The Kooikerhondje breed is not recommended for apartment or city dwelling. They thrive on physical activity and do best in a rural setting with ample opportunity to run, roam, and hunt.","They are prone to such health issues as Epilepsy, Von Willebrand Disease, Eye Disorders, Patella, Luxation, and Myelopathy. Kooikers have good appetites and a tendency to put on weight easily. Today (due to a lot of hard work in the national clubs) most Kooikers used for breeding are free from von Willebrands disease (most national clubs require both male and female dogs to be free from this disease to be allowed to breed). Patellar luxation is no major problem in most countries at the moment, but is kept under a close watch to prevent it from becoming a problem again. In the Netherlands, eye tests are available and all breeders breeding according to the breed club's rules have to test their dogs. Only dogs that are free of eye diseases can be used for breeding. Typically a Kooiker has an average lifespan of 12-14 years.",not available,Outdoorsy type Hunters Families Experienced owners,Brave Versatile Alert Reserved with strangers
Labradoodle,not available,"A Labradoodle is a mixed-breed dog created by crossing the Labrador Retriever and the Standard or Miniature Poodle. The first known use of the term ""Labradoodle"" was by Sir Donald Campbell to describe his Labrador/Poodle cross dog in his 1955 book, ""Into the Water Barrier"". The cross breed was later evolved as an assistant dog for people with allergies and/or asthma. In the eighties Wally Cochran at the Royal Guide Dog Association in Australia, wanted to place an assistance dog with a vision-impaired woman in Hawaii whose husband suffered from allergies. There were 3 puppies in the first litter. One pup named ‘Sultan’ proved to have an allergy-friendly coat and was suitable to be a guide dog. Unsure what to call the pups they coined the phrase “Labradoodle”. Since then there have been two Breeding and Research Centres established for the Labradoodle. These Breeding Centres bred Labradoodle to Labradoodle, seeking consistency and uniformity. Some early litters had low to no shedding dogs whilst other matings produced shedding pups. But it was encouraging enough results to continue and preserve. Hence the Labradoodle was created and is now bred worldwide.","Due to the hybrid genetics of the labradoodlle, puppies may not have consistently predictable characteristics. While many Labradoodles display desired traits, their appearance and behavioural characteristics remain, to some extent, unpredictable. Though over all, this breed is very intuitive and energetic. The Labradoodle makes a good companion dog and does well as a service animal with the right training. This dog is becoming very popular in the average home environment. Labradoodles often display an affinity for water and strong swimming ability from their parent breeds","As intelligent family dogs, Labradoodles can sometimes be too clever for their own good. They take pleasure in obedience but can also find ways to entertain themselves by outwitting their owners by opening doors or playing tricks. They make good watchdogs and should get along well with children if properly socialized. However the temperament of the Poodle may linger which can cause issues in the future. The Labradoodle should get along well with other dogs if socialized properly and raised with them from puppy-hood, however has unknown tendencies when it comes to smaller animals.","The diversity in Labradoodles is incredible: they span 3 sizes, multiple generations, 8 colours and 3 coat types. All Labradoodles are lovely pets and make wonderful companions with a cheeky, scruffy irresistible quality. First crosses tend to be the largest size (Standard). Multi-Generation Labradoodles come in all three sizes and should have a softer, longer coat which usually shows lower shedding. As such, Labradoodles' hair can be anywhere from wiry to soft, and may be straight, wavy, or curly. Many Labradoodles do shed, although the coat usually sheds less and has less dog smellthan that of a Labrador retriever. Labradoodle coats are divided into three categories: wool (with tight curls, and similar in appearance to that of a Poodle, but with a softer texture); fleece (soft and free-flowing, with a kinked or wavy appearance); or hair (which can be curly, straight or wavy, but is more similar in texture to a Labrador's coat).","Labradoodles coat colours include chocolate, cafe, parchment, cream, gold, apricot, red, black, blue, white, silver and chalk (generally any colour a poodle can have).","The Labradoodle is a very intelligent dog combining the extreme trainability of both the Poodle and the Lab. They do well in agility sports and are very easy to train. Training techniques can and should be changed regularly to make training fun and keep this dogs attention. The Labradoodle should be very easy to housebreak if training is consistent, and does very well in many different sports.","Labradoodles are not fussy or particularly greedy eaters. Nor are they prone to obesity. They require grooming once a week. Shedding does vary. According to Generation, Labradoodles, particularly First Crosses can shed. However low to non-shedding Labradoodles can be breed and are more common in Australian Multi-Generational Labradoodles. All coats require a regular trim around their eyes and feet to ensure they can see out, and to help reduce mud being dragged in on paws!! Nails need clipping. It is possible to groom a Labradoodle yourself. However many owners do prefer a professional groomer to have a good clip occasionally particularly fleece doodles when their adult coat comes through. They will adapt quite readily to the amount of time you have for walks, however they will not thrive without human contact. Care should be taken in first year not to over-exercise or allow puppy to run up/down hills or on stairs. Whilst happy to walk with you they love to run and play off the lead.","The problems the Labradoodle could contend with are largely due to genetic problems in the parent breeds. It is essential when purchasing a puppy to ensure the parents have been screened for hereditary problems. Hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy should be tested for. Ear Infections are also known of: due to the Poodle parent, hair grows in doodle’s ears, which should be checked regularly to reduce the risk of infection. Australian Labradoodles have been known to suffer from progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), an inherited disease causing blindness, which occurs in both Miniature Poodles and Cocker Spaniels. It is recommended that Australian Labradoodles be DNA tested for PRA before being bred. UK Labradoodles have a high incidence (4.6%) of multifocal retinal dysplasia compared to Labradors. Cataract is common as well (3.7%) but prevalence is comparable to that of Labradors. Labradoodles usually live between 10 -15 years of age. The average number of pups in a litter is approximately 8. But litters can vary from 4, with 15 being the largest known!",not available,Families,Affectionate Love people Good Guide dog
Labrador,"Large: Male 22 – 24” (57 – 62 cm) to shoulder, Female 20 – 23” (55 – 60 cm). Males should weigh between 58 and 72 lb (29 and 36 kg), Females between 50 and 64 lb (25 and 32kg).","The modern Labrador Retriever has its origins in Newfoundland, on the East Coast of the United States. There, the St. John’s Water Dog, was used by the local fishermen to retrieve nets from the sea, carry ropes, tow dories and generally lend a helping hand. This breed was a hybrid of random working breeds brought to America from Europe in the 16th Century. To look at, they were small, skinny, and had a white chest, feet, chin and muzzle (tuxedo markings). Even today, these markings will show up in a small patch of white on a Lab’s chest (mediallion) or the odd white toe or white whiskers on the muzzle. By the late 1800’s, the development of the modern Labrador was well under way, thanks to breeding programmes created principally by the Earls of Malmesbury and the Dukes of Buccleuch (say, “B’cloo”). The legacy of the St. John’s Water Dog is evident in the modern Lab’s thick, short, waterproof coat, its strength and power, webbed toes (ideal for retrieving from water), athleticism and relaxed temperament.","Your Lab is sharp and alert, though gentle natured and moderately intelligent. Although one of the friendliest of the breeds, however their natural welcoming exuberance needs to be controlled right from puppyhood or that charming, bouncy puppy might one day knock someone over with an overexcited greeting. Trainable, patient and obedient, however they don’t make the best guard dogs because they are too friendly and trusting. They will bark a warning when someone comes to your home, or they hear something unfamiliar that they can’t see, but that’s about it. Labs need plenty of exercise or they become overweight and listless – your Lab is a natural family member, never happier than when going somewhere and doing something active with his “gang”.","Ranked 7th in Stanley Coven’s book “The Intelligence of Dogs”, Labs are active, enthusiastic, friendly, merry, loyal and loving. They love to be with you, whether you are going for a walk, a run, camping, hunting, whatever. They will play fetch forever! Your Lab is reliable, even tempered, willing and patient and therefore makes an ideal playmate for children. They love attention, parties and family occasions (mind that wagging tail at coffee table height!) and are good with other dogs and pets. The one thing they are not good at is being left alone for too long, even in the garden, as the lack of attention will lead to boredom and listlessness, and can lead to destructive behaviour. Labs have even been known to escape, looking elsewhere for company. They will even vanish when out on a walk, if a good scent grabs them by the nose, so clear identification is recommended, either by a collar tag or a microchip, preferably both. Labs have a great sense of smell, and love to hunt. They have a delightfully soft mouth that will hold an egg without breaking it, making them ideal for retrieving waterfowl. Watch out for your shoes and the children’s toys, because your Lab likes to practice his retrieving skills at home and will often bring you “gifts”. Good with children of all ages, and always fun loving, Labs can be boisterous when young – they mature at around three – so firm discipline is needed early on. They often show very puppyish behaviour right up to maturity and beyond, which is not to be mistaken for hyperactivity. Labs love to play fetch, Frisbee and are excellent at fly-ball. They are often used for Search and Rescue, detection and therapy work, such as care home visiting. Forever with his mind on his stomach, your Lab will beg in a most charming but persistent manner, so you will need all your powers of resistance if you are not to give in.","A good Labrador should have a broad, clearly defined head, with hanging ears, and alert, intelligent eyes with a friendly expression. The nose should be thick, with a broad muzzle. The neck should be strong, and the body solid and well built, but slim. Labs tend to gain weight if not exercised enough and fed too much – they don’t need nearly as much to eat as they think they do. The coat has two layers; a short, dense, water resistant outer coat, and a soft downy undercoat for warmth. The tail is straight and otter-like, tapering at the end to flick off water. Labs have webbed feet which makes them great swimmers. There are two types of Labrador, the Conformation (also known as the English, Show or Bench) and The Field (American or Working). We will call them the Show dog and the Working dog here. The Show Labrador tends to be shorter and stockier than its Working cousin, with a fuller face and a calmer, more placid nature. The Working is a little taller, and more lightly built. The temperament of the Working Lab tends to be livelier than the Show Lab, and will make a better sports companion. If you decide to go for a Working type Lab, try to avoid very long noses, thin heads and long legged, rangy bodies, as they probably come from a poor line, and may have other unseen defects","Labradors are registered in three colours: Black, Yellow and Chocolate. Black Labs should be solid black, though some have white hairs on their chest (known as a medallion), or on their toes, tails and elsewhere. Yellows come in anything from pale cream to a vivid copper, known as “fox-red”. Blacks and Chocolates both have noses that match their coat, but yellows, though normally born with black noses, occasionally arrive with pink ones. Some black noses can change seasonally, and this is known as a “snow nose” or a “winter nose”. Another, quite rare, Yellow variation is the Dudley, which has a pink nose and pink rims around the eyes. Many Labs carry genes for different colours which means the litters of matching parents can result in puppies of different colours. Like a box of chocolates, “You never know which one you’re going to get” (apologies to Forrest Gump.)","Your Labrador is easy to train. Food rewards work a treat, and they respond well to vocal commands and gestures, though time and patience is needed to teach these skills when young. “Sit”, “Down” and lead training are essential right from the start, because of their boisterousness. To a Lab, “walkies” is just a perfect opportunity to say hello to all his friends and complete strangers too, so you need to be in control.","Your Labrador will only need an occasional brush – once a week is enough to keep the coat soft and shiny. Lack of exercise and obesity can lead to a dull coat and skin, so the answer is plenty of fresh air and exercise.","A slim, active Labrador should stay healthy and live to at least 10 - 12 years. They have a tendency to go grey around the muzzle quite young, but this is no indication of any problems. Your main concern will be your Lab’s weight. Because they love their food so much it is very easy to think you are not feeding them enough. Don’t listen – he’s telling porky pies! Lots of exercise and a regular diet should keep him fit and well. Treats as rewards are ok, but not at the table or any other time. There are some hereditary disorders to watch out for, mainly Hip and Elbow Displasia. It’s a good idea to ask your breeder what your puppy’s parents’ hip scores are, and if you breed from your own dog, have him or her hip scored before you decide to continue. Luxating Patella (where the knee, or stifle, keeps dislocating itself and then clicking back into place) is quite common. Eye problems and deafness can also be inherited, and certain auto-immune diseases. Quite common is Exercise Induced Collapse that can happen after short bouts of exercise, where the dog becomes overheated (hyperthermia), disorientated and weak, leading to collapse. There is also Hereditary Myopathy, a disease of the muscle fibres which is fortunately rare. If you choose your puppy carefully, from a good bloodline and a reputable breeder, you should not have any problems beyond those which happen to all of us as we get older. Your Lab will remain a happy-go-lucky playmate for the whole family all of his life.",not available,"Active Families, with or without children Hunters, anglers Runners, cyclists Campers, walkers Any outdoor sports people","Beautiful and waggy Short, thick tail (ideal for dusting coffee tables!)

Lakeland Terrier,not available,"Dating from the 1700’s, this terrier originated in the Lake District. They were bred to keep foxes away from sheep and hunt rats in the surrounding mountains. By the early 1900’s local people were talking about the ‘new improved Fell Terrier’ but by 1912 the name Lakeland terrier was agreed upon. Its compact size, coupled with the stamina and energy to spend all day in the field made it a well-regarded working dog.   As they grew more popular, they were shown at local agricultural events and countryside shows but as a breed it was still outside of Kennel Club regulation. The Lakeland Terrier Association (now closed) was founded in 1921 and regulated the breed. Members were split on whether Kennel Club recognition was desirable or not, but in 1928 a majority was obtained in favour of application for Kennel Club recognition. The Lakeland Terrier Club was founded in 1932 and the continued progression of the breeds profile was propagated even further","Bred to be tireless workers, these little guys can be independent and stubborn, but they are usually eager to please. Lakeland Terriers are extremely bold, but they get along with other dogs. However, they should still be kept on a leash when in public. Overall, these dogs have a friendly and fun demeanour.","Robust, hardy and healthy, with a liking for people and especially tolerant of children, in many ways the Lakeland Terrier is an ideal dog, however, as much as they can live with other pets, they cannot always be trusted with dogs of the same sex, especially another terrier with a typical ‘small dog attitude’ to life! They respond well to consistent and firm training. A dependable and patient leader is a must for the gutsy temperament of this dog. Though relatively small, they are active dogs with a lot of stamina and they love to race round, run and play. They can walk all day, in all weathers, but many have adopted the liking for fireside living if the weather is very rainy. This dog loves to chase moving objects so should never be let off lead unless in a fenced in yard. Very feisty and vivacious, this breed requires firm training. They love to dig and have the tendency to guard items that he considers ""his."" The Lakeland terrier is somewhat of a barker too.","Lakeland Terriers have small, square-built frames. Their long, narrow heads have a pair of wily, intelligent, oval and dark eyes and V-shaped ears that fold forward. They have strong necks that slope down to deep chests, short backs and medium-length tails that point straight up. The coat is double, with a soft undercoat and a wild, woolly and harsh outer layer. This makes the coat quite weather resistant, which is suited to the less than clement Lakeland weather. The Lakeland is a sturdy dog with a compact yet narrow shape and long legs.","Most Lakeland Terriers are some variation of the black and tan colour, ranging from a mixture of the two colours, to mostly black or mostly tan. Solid colours include blue, black, liver, red, or wheaten.

Height:\xa0Male: 14.5; Female: 13.5 inches Popularity: Like all dog breeds, the effects of World War II limited breeding of this dog and the population took a nose dive, but by the end of the 1950’s interest in the breed was taken up again <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>\n    This breed was once known as the Patterdale Terrier. Breed History: Dating from the 1700’s, this terrier originated in the Lake District. They were bred to keep foxes away from sheep and hunt rats in the surrounding mountains. By the early 1900’s local people were talking about the ‘new improved Fell Terrier’ but by 1912 the name Lakeland terrier was agreed upon. Its compact size, coupled with the stamina and energy to spend all day in the field made it a well-regarded working dog.\xa0  As they grew more popular, they were shown at local agricultural events and countryside shows but as a breed it was still outside of Kennel Club regulation. The Lakeland Terrier Association (now closed) was founded in 1921 and regulated the breed. Members were split on whether Kennel Club recognition was desirable or not, but in 1928 a majority was obtained in favour of application for Kennel Club recognition. The Lakeland Terrier Club was founded in 1932 and the continued progression of the breeds profile was propagated even further Character: Bred to be tireless workers, these little guys can be independent and stubborn, but they are usually eager to please. Lakeland Terriers are extremely bold, but they get along with other dogs. However, they should still be kept on a leash when in public. Overall, these dogs have a friendly and fun demeanour. Temperament: Robust, hardy and healthy, with a liking for people and especially tolerant of children, in many ways the Lakeland Terrier is an ideal dog, however, as much as they can live with other pets, they cannot always be trusted with dogs of the same sex, especially another terrier with a typical ‘small dog attitude’ to life! They respond well to consistent and firm training. A dependable and patient leader is a must for the gutsy temperament of this dog. Though relatively small, they are active dogs with a lot of stamina and they love to race round, run and play. They can walk all day, in all weathers, but many have adopted the liking for fireside living if the weather is very rainy. This dog loves to chase moving objects so should never be let off lead unless in a fenced in yard. Very feisty and vivacious, this breed requires firm training. They love to dig and have the tendency to guard items that he considers ""his."" The Lakeland terrier is somewhat of a barker too. Conformation: Lakeland Terriers\xa0have small, square-built frames. Their long, narrow heads have a pair of wily, intelligent, oval and dark eyes and V-shaped ears that fold forward. They have strong necks that slope down to deep chests, short backs and medium-length tails that point straight up. The coat is double, with a soft undercoat and a wild, woolly and harsh outer layer. This makes the coat quite weather resistant, which is suited to the less than clement Lakeland weather.\xa0The Lakeland is a sturdy dog with a compact yet narrow shape and long legs. Colour: Most Lakeland Terriers are some variation of the black and tan colour, ranging from a mixture of the two colours, to mostly black or mostly tan. Solid colours include blue, black, liver, red, or wheaten.

Lancashire Heeler,Small: Weight Male 13 lb (5.9 kg) Female 7 lb (3.2 kg) Height Male 12” (30.5 cm) Female 10” (25.4 cm),This breed has been in existence since the 17th century and is thought to be a cross between the Welsh Corgi and Manchester Terrier and possibly the Dachshund or other breeds. Some aficionados claim this breed is actually the ancestor of the Welsh Corgi. This breed was in decline but was regenerated in the 1960s and the Lancashire Heeler Club was established in Britain in 1978. The breed was developed as a herder and driver of cattle and sheep. They are the smallest of the English herding dogs and are also adept at hunting and catching both rabbits and rats. The Lancashire Heeler was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1981 but as numbers have declined it has been placed on the KC’s “vulnerable native breeds” list. A number of dedicated breeders are trying to save this dog from possible extinction but in 2007 only 146 were registered with the Kennel Club. Today this breed continues to be used as a working dog and companion.,"The Lancashire Heeler breed is sturdy, strong, hardy and well-built. This breed is agile, athletic, quick-witted and energetic. They are extremely hardworking and alert dogs. They are affectionate and loyal, doing best in a home with older, considerate children. They do well with other dogs and household pets. They can be wary and suspicious of strangers and will alert their family to visitors and danger.",This breed is intelligent yet stubborn. They will learn new commands and obedience training very easily provided they want to as they have a stubborn streak. These delightful dogs are independent yet incredibly loyal with a sunny and playful disposition. This breed is often used as PAT therapy dogs in hospices and nursing homes. This breed can have a nervous disposition and is not always well suited to households with other pets and young children but early socialisation is recommended to help calm their nervous tendency.,"The strength and sturdiness of this breed makes up for its small size. The dog’s length is longer than its height, hence the theory of Dachshund ancestry. The tail reflects this dog’s cheery personality and curves jauntily over its backend. The Lancashire Heeler often appears to smile when its mouth is slightly open and its lipped are pulled back. The tail is thick and flows smoothly from its straight back. This breed is well-muscled and has strong legs with outward turned front feet. The ears are either pricked or tipped and the skull is broad and smooth. The eyes are moderately sized and a dark, almond shaped. Coat: The coat is short, hard and flat. This is a double coat breed. The outer coat is weather-resistant and thick whereas the undercoat is fine in texture. The hair around the neck is slightly longer.",The coat comes in black and tan or liver and tan which was approved in 1999.,"This breed may attempt to herd family members, including cats. These dogs are easily trained but can be stubborn so need training which is patient and firm. They can be nervous, especially when not exercised sufficiently and need proper socialisation with pets and people from a young age. This herding breed needs to be taught not to nip and herd people and require a dominant handler with clear leadership. They do not response well to harsh, heavy-handed training but respond well to fairness and consistency. Training this dog can often be a battle of wills but always try to be positive and encouraging when training this breed as they will remember negative behaviour in the future.","The Lancashire Heeler requires weekly brushing with a wire brush and bathing should be done only when necessary. This breed sheds seasonally in Spring and Autumn.  Some owners use a washing up glove or grooming mitt, running their hand over the length of the body to remove dead or loose hairs easily – doing this once or twice a week is sufficient. This small dog has a fairly large exercise requirement and needs a good long walk at least once a day to keep it fit, healthy and stimulated This breed will do okay in an apartment provided they are sufficiently exercised and given proper mental stimulation. They love walks provided they are securely on the lead and enjoy free play in a securely fenced yard along with herding and family activities. They have a strong instinct to round and herd and will attempt to herd children, the postman or any other animal. They herd by snapping at the heel and it can be difficult to overcome this breed’s herding instinct but this behaviour can be channelled into other activities such as flyball, agility and trailing all of which the Lancashire Heeler will relish. This breed has fairly large exercise requirements despite its small size and needs a good long walk at least once a day to stay fit and healthy.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 13 years, however, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur.  This breed is prone to health issues such as Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA), patella luxation and primary lens luxation. Collie Eye Anomaly is an inherited and congenital disease which affects certain parts of the eye. It is usually a mild disease that does not disadvantage the dog, however, breeders use DNA testing to ensure their dogs do not produce pups with the disease. Due to their long back and short legs, this breed can be prone to back injury mainly caused by jumping down from furniture, the car or flights of stairs. Such injury can be easily prevented by owner observation and discouraging it from being in the situation in the first place.","('Foundation Stock Service Category: Versatility in jobs including retrieving, herding and ratting',)","High-energy, active owners Homeowners with fenced-in yards Families with older children Those looking for a versatile canine worker Folks who like to be carry a herding dog in a purse",Affectionate Agile Energetic Loyal Athletic
Large Munsterlander,Large: Weight approximately 66 lb (30 kg) Height Male 24 – 26” (60 – 65 cm) Female 2 – 25” (58 – 63 cm),"The Large Munsterlander is originally from the Münster region in Germany. It is one of several continental breeds of versatile hunting dogs. Although the breed is one of the last of the German breeds to gain official representation by a separate breed club, the Large Munsterlander was recognised as a colour variant of the German Longhaired Pointer prior to that time. The breed gained official recognition in the Munsterland of northwestern Germany in the early 1900s but the forerunner of the modern Large Munsterlander has been seen in artist’s representations of hunting scenes as far back as the Middle Ages.  This breed was introduced to North America in 1966 by Kurt von Kleist. In the latter part of the 19th century, interest was growing in individual breeds so the different types were separated. When the German Long-Haired Pointer Club drew up its standards, for some reason, the only colour allowed was liver and white. Litters with all colourations were produced and the black and white puppies, many with excellent blood lines, were given away to farmers and hunters from the Munster area in Germany. Colour did not matter to them and, so these puppies were bred, possibly bringing in other breeds, e.g. spaniel or setter types, until in 1919 the Large Munsterlander was given recognition in his own right to differentiate him from the smaller version.","This field dog is calm and gentle with children and well adjusted to family life. They are loyal, affectionate and trustworthy. This breed is versatile making it a reliable companion for all facets of hunting. A recent comparison of the scores of 82 Large Munsterlanders with 104 other versatile breeds entered in North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association (NAVHDA) tests showed that the Large Munsterlander is a versatile dog that on average works more closely and is more responsive to its handler than other breeds, however it’s pointing instinct matures later. This breed co-operates more than other breeds and has excellent concentration when tracking and recovering crippled game birds. During search for game, most dogs range from 50 to 150 yards (46 to 140 m0 depending on cover.","The Munsterlander is loyal and affectionate. It loves to work and be close to its master. They are good and patient with children but can get boisterous when excited. The Munsterlander requires dedicated training but are willing to please and quick to learn. They bond well with their family and have no problems mixing with other dogs and pets. When necessary this breed will act as a watchdog and can be quite vocal, often bringing their owner presents when they return home. They are eager to work, brave and have a gentle nature but they do need a lot of time and attention from their owner.","The Large Munsterlander is athletic, intelligent, noble and elegant in appearance. Its body should be the same length as its height at the withers. The dog is muscular without being bulky and its gait is fluid and elastic. The head and skull is well proportioned to the body and elongated. They have strong jaw muscles, a well formed black nose  and intelligent, medium sized dark brown eyes that are neither deep set or protruding. The ears are broad and set high, lying flat and close to the head. The neck is strong, muscular and slightly arched and the chest is wide with a good depth of brisket. Well muscled thighs, well turned stifles, hocks well let down. Dewclaws should be removed. Previously docking of the tip of the tail was optional. If left undocked it should be well set on, in line with the back, tapering towards the tip. It should be well feathered and carried horizontally or curved slightly upwards. Coat: The coat is black and white with hair of medium length. This dog has been bred for many decades for hunting and not show. Hence coat colour is highly variable, ranging from predominantly white to predominantly black. Markings occur as solid white patches, or ticked or roan regions.The head is usually predominantly black and the tip of the tail white, regardless of the distribution of black and white on the rest of the body. The coat is dense, but should be firm and sleek.",The coat  of a Large Munsterlander can be black or blue roan with white. The Small Munsterlander’s coat comes in brown (liver) and white,Both Large and Small Munsterlanders are relatively easy to train and are eager to please their owner. They can be dominant so need consistent and firm handling to prevent them becoming unmanageable,"They have a tendency to become picky eaters if spoiled so it is recommended to follow the breeder’s diet sheet. They benefit from eating a little and often. They do not enjoy being left alone for long periods of time. The Munsterlander requires little grooming, with a weekly comb and brush being sufficient. The feathered ears, front and hind legs and tail may occasionally need tidying up. Excess hair between the pads of the feet should be trimmed. These dogs enjoy all types of weather so be aware that they can get very muddy and dirty.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 13 years, however, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed has few reported common ailments but take care whilst exercising a young puppy as they can develop hip dysplasia. This breed is not prone to any other disorders.

He crossed several large breeds such as the Saint Bernard and the Newfoundland to create the big, beautiful canine known as the Leonberger which instantly became popular with European and Russian royals. It is reputed to have been bred to have the look of the lion on the Leonberg town crest. The first dogs registered with the name Leonberger appeared in the 1840s and were used as strong, multipurpose farm dogs, able to withstand the cold temperatures of the high mountains. This breed quickly became popular due to its solid, steady nature, watchdog tendencies and brute strength for pulling carts and general draft work. This breed almost became extinct during World War I but enthusiasts restored and revived the breed. They are considered to be the oldest of the German breeds. The Leonberger continues to be used as a working breed and companion in Germany, France and Scandinavia but is relatively rare in other countries.

Special care should be taken during seasonal shedding of the coat. Bathing should only be done when necessary. It is important to regularly clean the ears and provide good dental hygiene. This breed is continuously heavy shedding with a seasonal shedding of the coat. While its thick coat may seem warm in the summer months, it can insulate it against extreme heat and therefore should not be shaved. It is wise to limit exercise during the heat of the day and provide access to fresh water and shade. Do not consider getting this breed unless you are able to commit to its needs.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 10 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is prone to health issues such as hip dysplasia, OCD, Addison’s disease, entropion, ectropion, osteosarcoma and hypothyroidism.

Lhasa Apso,Small: Weight 13 – 15 lb (6 – 7 kg) Height 9 – 11” (23 – 28 cm),"Lhasa Apso was used to guard Tibetan palaces and temples. This bold and alert canine’s duty was to guard the interior of the building, while its massive and imposing partner (the Tibetan Mastiff) was charged with guarding the outside. In the early 1930s, the Dalai Lama helped introduce the Lhasa Apso to America and other parts of the world. The Lhasa Apso originated in Tibet, and were only bred by holy men and nobles. Thought to bring good luck, this breed was considered to be sacred. For this reason, the Lhasa were used as watchdogs in monasteries for over 2000 years. They are highly intelligent, with keen instinct and acute hearing. The Lhasa Apso is believed to be one of the world’s oldest dog breeds with recent DNA analysis identifying them as one of the 14 most ancient breeds. Some experts claim the breed dates back to 800 BC when it was developed from the Tibetan Terrier and the Tibetan Spaniel. For centuries the dog was bred exclusively in Tibet. Due to the remote nature of Tibet and how the dogs were revered by monks, the Lhasa Apso did not become well known until relatively recently. Rarely were Lhasa Apsos permitted to leave their homeland, and the few that were given to honoured guests, mostly Chinese, were male. In this way, reproduction of the species remained in Tibetan control. This is primarily because the Buddhist way of life values all living things, with the belief that souls of deceased people could enter the bodies of this little dog. As such the trading of them was strictly prohibited. The first Lhaso Apso’s in Britain were gifts to a member of the Indian Medical Service, who in turn gave the dogs to the wife of a British official in the early 20th century. This gift to the west has resulted in a different bloodline from the original Tibetan strain and over the years thoughts have been put forwards as to how to preserve the originality of the breed by rejoining the two lines in some way.","The Lhasa Apso is hardy and vigorous and exude an air of dignity. They can be wary and suspicious of strangers but are considered to be one of the most affectionate breeds with their main function being that of a companion. They have a dual temperament, being highly expressive of their love and devotion but also having a mind of their own and wanting everything their own way. They are spirited, lively and happy and have an acute sense of hearing making them excellent watchdogs. They prefer to be the only pet in a household as they thrive on attention.",This hardy dog is friendly but assertive and is intelligent and lively. They make good pets and companions and are fond of a warm lap or bed to sleep in. They are very affectionate towards their family and quick to learn. They respond well to motivational training and are very obedient and have a good sense of hearing making them good watchdogs. They can be quite comical dogs and readily learn new tricks. This breed cannot bear to be left alone and does not tolerate changes to their daily routine. The Lhasa Apso has a desire to be with people and protect their owners and with appropriate socialisation can live with children and other animals. They have a kind nature but can be wary of strangers. This breed is noted for travelling well and can endure high altitudes being a mountain bred dog. Legend says that they are reputed to have a sixth sense which gives them the ability to sense avalanches before they occur.,"The Lhasa Apso has a small sturdy frame covered in a long, dense coat. Its head has a square muzzle, black nose, moustache and beard, hanging ears and dark medium sized eyes. Its feathered tail curls over the back. This breed looks cheerful but determined. Coat: The Lhasa Apso has a double coat over the entire body. The cover serves as an insulation barrier that keeps them warm in winter and cool in summer. The coat grows to floor length, even covering the eyes. The texture of the coat is neither soft nor silky. The coat is naturally parted from head to tail down the centre of its back. Many non professional owners prefer to clip the hair back for ease of care.","The coat can be any shade from black, gold, cream, white, liver and red. Occasionally the ears may be tipped with a darker colour","This breed is very strong willed so it is important to maintain authority when training. They do not respond well to harsh or heavy-handed training but respects a firm, positive leader. You have to earn this dog’s respect. The Lhasa Apso can display an arrogant and obstinate attitude and may be difficult to housetrain so the crate method is recommended. This breed requires intense early socialisation and training and respond well to praise and rewards. If they are not clearly shown who is the master, this little dog will take charge.",They are fairly easy to groom but need more attention when the hair is long. Daily brushing and occasional bathing will keep the coat looking good. If the coat is left long they are extremely high maintenance. They are prone to eye problems and ear infections to it is important to check and clean them regularly. This breed is an average shedder.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 14 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 18 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is prone to suffering from eye problems such as Dry Eye (Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca) which is caused when the eyes don’t produce enough tears to stay moist. A vet can perform tests to determine if this is the cause which can be controlled by medication. They can also suffer from Cherry Eye, which is a prolapse of a gland in the eye. It is a common defect in some breeds where the gland of the third eyelid prolapses and becomes visible. It appears as a red mass in the inner corner of the eye and is sometimes mistaken for a cancerous tumour. The eye becomes chronically inflamed and there is often a discharge. Because the gland is responsible for about a third of the eye’s tear production, the eye can eventually suffer from dryness. This breed can also suffer from kidney disease, hip dysplasia, respiratory ailments and skin disorders. Exercise: Lhasa Apso needs daily exercise to maintain its upbeat attitude. Fresh air and walks will also keep it healthy. They benefit from free play outside in a protected open area. The Lhasa Apso is a well-behaved traveller. Inside the Lhasa Apso is playful and rambunctious which will largely meet their exercise needs.","('Non-sporting',)",Retirees City dwellers Couch potatoes Families with older children,Lively Outgoing Bold Friendly
Lowchen,Small: Weight Male 10 – 18 lb (4.5 – 8 kg) Female 10 – 16 lb (4.5 – 7 kg) Height Male 13 – 14” (33 – 36 cm) Female 12 – 13” (30 – 33 cm),"The Lowchen, which means “little lion” in German, dates back to the 15th century. Some enthusiasts claim they originated in Germany whereas others say they have a Meditarrenean background. They were particularly favoured by aristocracy and have been popular lapdogs and companions for centuries, featuring in many famous paintings. The breed nearly became extinct during the first half of the 20th century but Madame Bennert of Belgium is credited with saving this breed. The Lowchen has appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records twice: once as the world’s most expensive dog and also as the rarest dog in the world.","The Lowchen is active, well-balanced and strongly built with a playful spirit. They make excellent companions with their charming and delightful personality. They are positive and outgoing with a regal bearing and style. This breed is extremely intelligent, affectionate and sociable. They are eager to please and are loyal and devoted to their owners. They are fearless, resourceful, and bold. They possess a gentle and sensitive nature, and firmly attach themselves to their family. This breed is good with children, other dogs, and other household pets. The Lowchen is fragile in appearance but is actually robust and tough. They may display arrogance or a strong-willed attitude. They are extremely protective of their family and will bark to warn of danger or visitors. The Lowchen is cheerful and playful, but is not hyperactive or high-strung.","Despite its fragile presentation, owners of this dog often report that it makes an excellent guard dog.  They are somewhat puppy like in their behaviour and enjoy playing with the family due to their lively personality. They are entertainers and never really grow up in their behaviour. This lovable nature makes them pleasing to own as family pets, being kind to children and other animals, so long as they are socialised from an early age. Adaptable, friendly, loyal and bright rather than intelligent, they like to be a constant companion and are at their happiest when snuggled in a warm lap or bed. They can be quite excitable at times however, but are generally suited for all situations and lifestyles.","The Lowchen has a small, compact frame covered in a long, soft coat. Its short broad head has deeply set eyes, a dark nose and pendant ears draped in long hair. Its tail is set high and usually carried over the back. Coat: Lowchens are considered a Bichon type dog. Unclipped dogs have a long coated and quite scruffy look. The coat is long and wavy in appearance, especially around the ears. The coat is often presented in the Lion Cut. This means that the haunches, legs (apart from so called ‘bracelets around the lower leg) and part of the tail is shaved, with the left of the coat left in its natural state to present a ‘lions mane’ around the rest of the body, hence the name.","The coat can be any shade from chocolate and apricot, chocolate and cream, gold, sable, black and tan, blue and cream","The Lowchen is intelligent and willing to please which means they are easy to train. They excel at obedience and agility. It is important for this breed to be socialised early and proper training will discourage their tendency to bark excessively and curtail their tendency to dig. They response well to gentle, fair, fun and consistent training.",This breed benefits from a thorough brush every week to prevent matting and tangling but a daily brushing is even better. The Lowchen is usually clipped to have a “lion” look which requires professional grooming every four to six weeks. Bathing should be done on a weekly basis and it important that sunscreen be applied to the shorn area to prevent sunburn.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 14 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed has relatively few genetic health issues but some can develop a knee problem called patellar luxation as well as eye problems such as cataracts and PRA (progressive retinal atrophy). Exercise: This breed loves long walks, daily jogs and hiking. They enjoy free play off the lead but are suitable for apartment dwelling provided they are given sufficient exercise and play sessions. This breed benefits from a securely fenced yard. Exercise wise, this dog requires minimal amounts and is happy with a good run or play in the garden or a daily walk. Because it is low impact in terms of exercise, it can be suited to a person who does not have a particularly active lifestyle or a small home.","('Non-sporting',)",Retirees Families City-dwellers,Cheerful Sensitive Loving Friendly
Lurcher,not available,"Lurchers first emerged in the 18th Century, associated with gypsies and poachers. The name derives from the Romany word lur, meaning thief or bandit, and cur, Middle English for a mixed dog breed. Sight-hounds such as Greyhounds, Wolfhounds and Deerhounds, while fast and effective hunters, did not have the intelligence to perform the tasks required by gypsies and poachers, ie pursuit and capture of rabbits, hares and game birds, often at night. Over time, certain crosses proved better than others, until the original sight-hounds, including the Saluki and the Whippet, were more often than not crossed with Terriers and Collies, which eventually produced the intelligent, canny Lurcher we know today.","Your Lurcher is actually quite lazy, and loves to take up most of the space on your sofa, or collapse in a hairy heap in the sun. However, once up and running, so to speak, he will become the intense, skilful hunter he was designed to be. This means making a few compromises for his sake, like not keeping cats or very small dogs or other small pets – to him they are dinner. However, your Lurcher is highly trainable, but needs real leadership from you. He is not a dog for small spaces, and needs a good sized garden to play in to burn off some of that energy. You will need to keep him leashed on walks or runs or you may find he has disappeared to go hunting, or has gone after the “wrong” prey, like your neighbour’s cat","Despite his advanced hunting instincts, your Lurcher is a gentle person, and very loving. He is naturally sweet natured, though the level of his tolerance of children may depend on what cross he is. A Collie cross might be more suitable for families with children than a Terrier cross which may be more feisty. Remember the word lur, Romany for thief? Turn your back from the kitchen table and you could easily find that what was on it isn’t there anymore, and your Lurcher will be licking his lips and trying to look innocent at the same time. Your Lurcher will keep you fit, and be a wonderful happy companion, giving you many rewards for the few compromises you make for his sake.","While there is no breed standard as such, your Lurcher, whatever his dimensions, should be long legged, with straight pasterns, have a very defined waist, a deep brisket and a longish, gently curved tail. He should give the appearance of floating lightness, despite his hardiness. The short coat can be flat and fine like a Greyhound, or slightly thicker like a Boxer.

Eye colour varies from dark brown to pale hazel or even blue","Your Lurcher looks for leadership, and is therefore very easy to train. But always remember he is a sight-hound, so if he sees a bunny running in the distance (and he is very long sighted) he’ll go after it, and he’ll be so focussed he won’t hear you calling him back. Therefore games off-leash are best kept to the back garden, while walks and runs are best on-leash. He won’t mind. A born runner, you might like to think about racing him in Lurcher races locally, or take him lure coursing, a great alternative to hare coursing which is now illegal in many countries.","Your Lurcher is not for the asthmatic. He will shed quite copiously whether long or short coated, and needs brushing every day. He is also prone to cuts on his pads, so be careful where you run him, avoiding flinty ground where possible.","Your Lurcher can live up to 13 trouble free years. The only problems to watch out for are hip dysplasia and slipped disc, so don’t let him run around in circles or jump too much. Like many deep chested dogs, he can suffer with bloat (gastric torsion) which can be life threatening. Feed him a little and often to prevent this happening and avoid exercise too soon after meals.

Maltese,Small: Weight 4 – 6 lb (1.8 – 2.7 kg) Height 8 – 10” (20 – 25.4 cm,"The Maltese is one of the world’s oldest breeds. It is estimated that the breed originated about 8,000 years ago. They feature in Roman poetry and had special tombs for them by the Greeks. Although the ancient Greeks and Romans believed the dog originated on the Island of Malta, there is really no evidence that proves the dog was indigenous to the Island, but rather that the Maltese is descended from a Spitz-type dog bred by the people who lived in Central Europe. Malta was a central point for trading and these little, good looking dogs were sold as wares and commodities would be from there, these little dogs were taken all over the world with traders and travellers reaching as far as South East Asia and China. The Maltese made its American debut in Westminster’s first show in 1877 and was registered by the AKC one year later. Beginning around the mid 1800's and early 1900’s, speculation into the origins of the Maltese began and what ‘group’ they should be classified within, given their probable Spitz ancestors but rather small stature. Breeders in England, felt that the Maltese belonged in the Terrier family due to their fearless temperament and the fact that they were rather good ratters. People were unable to agree so the breed was simply to be referred to as the Maltese dog from then onwards. The first English Kennel Club stud book has twenty-four Maltese Dogs registered between 1859 and 1873. A prolific breeder of the time (1875 through 1885) was a Lady Giffard, whose dogs were noted for their long silky coats.","This breed has been the beloved companion to princes and princesses for well over 2,000 years. They are gentle, loving, obedient creatures that love attention and affection. They have a fearless energy that can make them more of a handful than the typical, docile lapdog. The Maltese is perfect for city-dwellers and good with children, especially older children. They are confident around other dogs without being overly confident. Their fearlessness makes them self-assured rather than defensive.","The Maltese displays a graceful and regal demeanour and were previously favoured by nobles, royals and aristocracy. They are intelligent, animated and playful dogs and love to be the centre of attention. This breed is loving and deeply devoted to their owners. The Maltese is gentle, trusting, and obedient. They are typically good natured and amiable and love to be held and cuddled. They will tolerate other pets, but are not suitable for inconsiderate or ill-behaved children. They can have a tendency to be ‘snappy’ with smaller children and should be supervised when playing with children, although socialising them at a young age to a wide range of people and other animals will reduce this behaviour. They most often will establish a close bond with one person. The Maltese commit themselves fully to their owner and families. The Maltese is very active within a house and appears to prefer smaller spaces. They can also suffer from separation anxiety and display undesirable behaviours such as chewing, howling, barking and scratching when suffering from this.","This toy-sized breed is covered in a long, silky white (or cream) coat. The head is medium-sized with a rounded skull, hanging ears, tapered muzzles and dark noses and eyes. They carry their heads high on their long necks and carry the tail over its back giving them a distinguished, aristocratic look. With its low hanging coat and smooth gait, this breed seems to float across the floor. Coat: The Maltese has an elegant mantle of long, silky hair. The coat is straight, lacks an undercoat, and is pure bright white in colour. They are non-shedding. Their luxurious cloak of white is the hallmark of the Maltese.",The coat comes in pure white or cream.,"This breed can be difficult to housetrain so crate training is recommended. They benefit from early socialisation but does not require extensive obedience training as they are naturally obedient dogs. They do not respond well to harsh training and are better with training that is gentle, consistent, rewarding and patient. They are adept at learning new tricks.","This breed requires daily grooming. The coat is silky and soft so take care when brush. They do not shed much which makes them a good choice for allergy suffers. They need bathing or dry shampooing on a regular basis. It is important to check and clean their eyes, ears and beards regularly. This breed does not do well in very hot climates or damp conditions and can be finicky eaters suffering indigestion. Dental hygiene is important to prevent tooth loss.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 18 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed can be prone to suffering from dental problems. Dog toys and biscuits that promote dental health can help to keep their teeth strong and clean. This breed can be prone to eye problems, skin disorders and respiratory problems. They are susceptible to ‘reverse sneezing’ which is a gagging, choking sound they can make when playing or are excited, however, this is no cause for alarm and no treatment is usually required. Exercise: This breed is happy with daily 20 - 30 minute walks and do not require a high level of exercise. They are suitable for apartment living and benefit from a small, securely enclosed yard. The Maltese is a social dog and benefits from a play date at the park.","('Toy',)",Singles Retirees Families with older children Kings and Queens,Loyal Affectionate Protective Fearless Agile
Manchester Terrier,Small: Weight 12 – 22 lb (5.4 – 10 kg) Height 15 – 16” (38 – 41 cm),"The Manchester Terrier originated in Manchester during the 19th Century. They were bred from a Whippet and a dark rat-catching terrier as vermin-hunters, used to keep rats away from stables, barns and warehouses. The Manchester Terrier comes in two varieties; standard and toy. The toy variety became popular during the reign of Queen Victoria. Although their popularity has diminished since then, this breed has retained its working capabilities and makes a lovely companion.","This breed is independent and protective but not aggressive. The Manchester Terrier has a steady temperament, gets along with other dogs and is patient with children. They are compact and agile as well as being very intelligent and lively. They are more responsive than other terrier breeds and respond well to positive training, affection and attention. The Manchester Terrier is very devoted and loyal to its family and thrive on human companionship, sometimes being quite demanding of people’s attention. However, they display the true nature of a Terrier in that they are independent yet faithful. They are best suited to a home with older, considerate children and are not recommended for homes with other household pets. This breed has a tendency to be snappish, combative and headstrong.","The Manchester Terrier is alert, energetic and feisty. They quickly form a strong bond with their owners and are very affectionate with their family but can be reserved with strangers. This breed is brave and willing to protect themselves, their home and their family and their keen eye makes them good watchdogs. They are keen to employ their barking skills to ward off any threats. The Manchester Terrier is lively and athletic and is well suited to active, energetic people. They are adaptable and love to be involved in family activity. They do well with gentle, well-behaved children and other dogs, however, if challenged the Manchester Terrier will not back down no matter the size of the other dog.

Maremma Sheepdog,Giant: Weight Male 77 – 99 lb (35 – 45 kg) Female 66 – 88 lb (30 – 40 kg) Height Male 25.5 – 28.5” (64.8 – 72.4 cm) Female 25 – 25” (63.5 – 68.6 cm),"The Maremma originated in (and was named after) a region of Tuscany where it has guarded sheep and livestock for centuries. Some documents tract the Maremma back to Ancient Rome. Ancient Italian writers have mentioned the dog and a 13th century picture in the church of Santa Maria in Florence depicts the Maremma. The original stock came from migrating Eastern shepherd dogs which developed into the individual breeds particular to a region, for example, the French Pyrennean Sheepdog and the Hungarian Kuvasz. In Italy, the shorter coated Maremmano and the longer backed Abruzzese merged into one breed sometime in the 1860s, due to seasonal movement of flocks. It is said that the courageous Maremma can ward off wolves, bears and human predators and their solitary function (both past and present) is guarding flock and property. The Maremma was first brought to England in 1931 with the dog ‘Drago of Castlenuova’. A mate was then brought over and a breeding programme was set up by Helen Home-Robertson and Mrs J. M. Pryor. Maremma’s now have their own class at Crufts and are generally used in this country for estate guard dogs and pets. Still popular in its native country, the Maremma Sheepdog is a helpful worker and companion in the United States, Australia and elsewhere.","The Maremma is sturdy, dignified and carries itself with a majestic appearance. It is a large breed and is well-built with an aloof expression. This is a true working breed and is not intended to solely be a pet as they are very intelligent, independent and alert. The Maremma is extremely adept at guarding farm, flock and family and is extremely loyal, affectionate and dedicated to its family and work. They do well with other dogs, pets and are good with children. They are always on the look out and have a tendency to bark.","This breed is happiest when at working guarding its flocks as it has a very strong and well developed guarding instinct. They are loyal to their master, devoted to their flock but intolerant of intruders making this breed a good guard dog. The Maremma is intelligent but can be difficult to train due to its strong willed nature and needs to be socialised well at a young age or it might not be well behaved with children and other dogs. They are good with other animals if they have been brought up them and well socialised at a young age. They are reasonably tolerant of others unless they feel their charges are being threatened and although it is not aggressive, this dog is courageous when protecting its flock and home.","The Maremma has a large, sturdy frame and has a rough, thick and slightly wavy coat that is usually white and sometimes has patches of yellow and orange. It has a broad, triangular head with a slightly tapered muzzle and dark, almond shaped eyes. The ears are small and high set. The neck should show strength as it leads to long, sloping shoulders and straight, well-boned forelegs. The frame is heavy boned and muscular. The feet are oval and well arched. The back should be strong and straight with a low set tail, reaching past the hocks. Its hindquarters are broad and muscular with well let down hocks and moderately bent stifles.  Coat: The coarse outercoat is white, ivory or pale fawn while the undercoat is thick and dense. Together both coats should waterproof the dog. The puppy coat is soft and woolly, growing harsher between six and twelve months. Puppies are always white in colour.","The coat is usually solid white, ivory or pale fawn in colour although orange or yellow tints can occur around the ears",This breed requires early socialisation and obedience training. Early socialisation and training will ensure this breed gets along well with smaller pets and children.The Maremma will regard its master as an equal and friend and do not respond well to harshness. Training must be done with respect and consistency. This breed is strong willed so can be difficult to train. It is loyal to one master but training may still take considerable effort.,"The Maremma is prone to bloating so it is recommended to feed it several smaller meals in the day rather than one large meal. Rough coated Maremmas are not prone to matting and tangling like the fine-coated versions but both types shed during spring and autumn. Maremmas that live mostly inside will need more brushing and clipping than their working counterparts. Regular brushing and grooming will remove loose hair and more attention is needed during shedding periods. The ears and paw pads need to be checked often for debris. Due to their rarity and selective breeding, this breed is not well suited to warm climates. Whilst this is quite a large dog, on reaching maturity it is not a big eater and therefore can be kept on a low maintenance diet. It matures slowly, not reaching full maturity till two years so it is advised that it be fed a special diet for giant breed puppies. It is important not to overfeed the puppies but be aware that there are growth spurts. Poor nutrition in its youth will lead to skeletal problems in older dogs.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 14 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. The Maremma is a hardy breed but can be susceptible to some ailments common to large breeds. They can suffer from hip dyplasia, achondroplasia and slipped patellas. Veterinary surgeons must be careful when anaesthetising this breed as it is sensitive to anaesthetics. Exercise: This breed is not recommended for apartment or city living. The Maremma requires a rural setting an an excessive amount of physical exercise and mental stimulation everyday. They do best with room to roam and enjoy having a job to do. While this breed can take a huge amount of exercise, it is not a necessity. This breed is used for guarding a herd and has stamina to work all day as they are endurance dogs rather than high energy. Between 40 and 60 minutes exercise a day is sufficient for this breed.","('Pastoral (Not AKC recognised) Category: Maremma Sheepdogs belong to the pastoral group and are used as guard dogs for herds, as companions and seen in the show-ring.',)",Farmers and ranchers Active singles Families Cold-climate dwellers,Gentle and nurturing Protective Dependable Playful Loyal

Another theory is that Phoenician traders introduced them to Britain at around the same time. This ancient breed  perhaps descended from the ancient Alaunt through the Pugnaces Britanniae (the original Roman name for the Mastiff). The breed was primarily used as a guard dog. The Mastiff was favoured by nobility as a hunting companion and revered by peasants as a family and livestock protector. They were also used as arena gladiators, participating in bull, bear and dog combat but this breed is now noted for its gentle temperament. The lineage of the modern dogs can be traced back to the early 19th century when organised breeding of the Mastiff started. The greatest weight ever recorded for a dog was a 343 lb (156 kg) English Mastiff from England named Aicama Zorba of La Susa. According to the Guinness Book of Records, at 7 years old Zorba stood at 35” (89 cm) at the shoulder and was  8.25 feet (251 cm) from nose to tail, about the size of a small donkey. This breed has a long history of being used in blood sports such as bear baiting, bull baiting, lion baiting and dog fighting. In 1835 the Parliament of the United Kingdom implemented the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, prohibiting the baiting of animals which led to the decline of the Mastiff being used for this purpose. Mastiffs continued to be used as guards for country estates and town businesses. The breed was almost extinct after World War I until a dog called Beowulf bred in Canada from British imports Priam of Wingfied and Parkgate Duchess was registered by the AKC in 1918, starting the slow re-establishment of this breed. The breed has gradually been restored and is now found worldwide.","Massive and sometimes lumbering, these dogs have a gentle, loving an dignified personality that makes them the quintessential “gentle giant”. Mastiffs are responsive and obedience with an intelligence so serene that they come across as extremely mellow. The Mastiff is watchful, reliable and intelligent. They are extremely loyal and devoted to their family, thriving on human companionship and affection. This breed does not do well if left alone for extended periods of time. The Mastiff does well in a home with older considerate children but is not good with other household pets unless they have been raised with them. This breed is naturally protective and possessive of its family and home. This breed is not recommended for the novice, inexperienced or passive owner.","The Mastiff has an imposing and dominant demeanour but are often referred to as a “gentle giant” due to their dignified yet mellow personality. They are fearless, alert and extremely courageous making them good estate guard dogs. The Mastiff is calm and affectionate to its master but is equally capable of protecting their owner. Any perceived threats will mean the Mastiff takes immediate defensive action, placing itself between its master and the perceived threat and using a warning growl. Some Mastiffs on the other hand will high behind their master before using their warning growl. The Mastiff will rarely attack a perceived threat unless severely provoked and instead will generally pin the individual until a human they know arrives and reassures them. Overall, Mastiffs are good natured, calm, easygoing and surprisingly gentle for their large size.","The Mastiff is a giant, symmetrically shaped dog with a powerful frame. While the Irish Wolfhound and Great Dane are taller, they are not as robust as the Mastiff. This breed has a large, square head with broad, wrinkly foreheads and short, black muzzles. The eyes are small and brown with a watchful and warm expression and the ears hang close to the cheek. They have thick, strong necks, deep chests and level backs with a tapered, high set tail that hangs low. The Mastiff carries itself with dignity and grandeur This breed has a double coat. The outer coat is short, coarse and straight while the undercoat is dense and fits close to the body. Pied Mastiffs are rare and other non-standard colours include black, blue brindle and chocolate mask.","The coat colour comes in apricot, fawn, silver or brindle with a black nose, muzzle and ears.","Early socialisation and obedience training is extremely important for this breed as the Mastiff requires a dominant handler. They do not respond well to harsh or heavy-handed methods. While eager to please, they can be difficult to train. This breed responds well to training that is firm and consistent and require a trainer who is respectful, fair and patient. The Mastiff is a sensitive breed and makes a well-mannered household pet. This breed excels in guarding, military and police work, weight pulled and search and rescue.","This breed has a tendency to drool and snore. The coat requires minimal grooming, occasional brushing with a firm bristle brush is sufficient. Bathing or dry shampooing should only be done when necessary. This breed is an average shedder","The lifespan of a healthy individual is around 10 years, however, some live for as long as 11 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. The Mastiff is prone to hip and elbow dysplasia, heart disease and eye problems. They are prone to bloat so it is recommended to feel them several smaller meals rather than one large meal a day. The Mastiff is a large dog that needs the correct diet and exercise to stay healthy. Excessive running is not recommended in the first two years of the dog’s life but regular exercise must be maintained to prevent lazy behaviour and health problems. A soft surface is needed for sleeping to prevent the development of calluses, arthritis  and hygroma (an acute inflammatory swelling). Due to the large size of this breed, puppies can potentially be smothered or crushed by the mother during nursing and a whelping box along with careful monitoring can prevent such accidents. The Mastiff can  also suffer gastric torsion, entropion, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and persistent pupillary membranes (PPM). When buying a Mastiff it is recommended that the dog be tested for hip and elbow dyplasia, thyroid and DNA for PRA. Exercise: The Mastiff is slow moving and has a tendency to be lazy. Daily walks on a lead or play sessions in a safely fenced yard are recommended to keep them happy and active. They do okay in an apartment provided they are given sufficient exercise and attention.","('Working',)",Singles Families with older children Outdoorsy types,Loyal and devoted Laid back Protective
Miniature Dachsund,Medium: weight male & female 11 lbs (4.9kg.) Height male and female 5-7 inches (13-18 cm.),"The Dachshund can be traced back to 15th century Germany. Dachshunds—coming from the German dach, which means “badger,” and hund, meaning “dog”—were used widely as hunting dogs. Their short, sleek frames and incredible sense of smell allowed them to hunt above ground, below ground and track animals for days at a time. Various sizes were developed over the years and the breed has come to exhibit ""terrier"" characteristics. They’re versatile and courageous dogs known to take on prey as large as foxes. The most distant appearance of a Dachshund type dog has been spotted in ancient Egyptian and Mexican art. In addition, remains of a Dachshund type dog were discovered with shipwreck remnants in Italy, dating back to the 1st century AD. A most enchanting and richly traveled breed I’m sure you’d agree! Though, the gene pool really came into its fruition, when Dachshunds were exported to Great Britain with Prince Albert, populating Britain and America throughout the 19th century. The Dachshund was lawfully recognised by the American Kennel club in 1885.","These intelligent pups have bundles of potential if lead by an owner who knows whose boss. The breed can become lovingly attached to their family and usually one family member in particular. It’s recommended that firm, consistent training techniques be used to overcome the dog's natural tendency to dominate, whilst not incurring a sense of injustice. Unfairly treated, a dachshund will sulk at length. If partial to long trips you’re in luck because this breed travels well. Be warned though, they are instinctive diggers so any freshly gardened plants may be just collateral damage in the latest escape plan.","Hell hath no fury like a Dachshund scorned- without proper leadership from their owners they can be jealous, irritable, obstinate and very quick to bite. If you allow your little dog to take over your house, the dog will try his hardest to keep all of his humans in line. Such a heavy weight should not be placed on any dog's shoulders, especially one as sweet and as little as the Dachshund. You see these negative traits are not Dachshund traits at all, they’re small dog syndrome traits. Meaning, most owners treat their small dogs like babies, rather than giving them leadership. Rules stating what they are, and are not allowed to do, which all dogs instinctually crave. Dachshunds who do have human leadership along with daily walks are wonderful family companions, with an excellent temperament. However, they thrive with single people also. Very young children could lack the necessary patience and maturity required with Dachshunds. Though very loyal to their owners, Dachshunds can take time to warm up to other people. The benefit, however, is that their (sometimes) relentless barking at the sign of strangers makes them an extremely handy—and compact—guard dog. Dachshunds, will also be happy in an apartment (they are among the most popular city dogs), but require lots of play, interaction and regular walks to stay in physical and mental shape.","There are three types of Dachshunds: Standard, Miniature and Toy. Their coats come in three varieties: the short-haired, the wired-haired, and the long-haired. A Dachshund’s head should be long and tapered with the forehead showing a slight arch and blending, in an unbroken line to the bridge of the nose. Obliquely set, the eyes should be almond shaped. The nose and eye rims, as well as the lips should be black. High set, the ears are long and rounded at the tip. The jaws are powerful and the teeth should meet in a scissor bite. The Dachshund “look” is hard to miss: long backed, short-legged dog of diminutive height. While small, the Dachshund is still muscular and powerfully built with a deep, broad chest and well-developed forelegs. The base of the neck slopes down to a protruding chest and a tighter abdomen.","Their colours can vary but most dachshunds are black with tan markings or a solid reddish-brown colour. However, they can appear as reds, dappled, with tiger markings, or brindle. Some may have a limited amount of white on the chest. Bi-colour dachshunds may be black and tan, black and cream, chocolate and tan, chocolate and cream, blue and tan, or blue and cream. If dappling occurs in the eye, one or both eyes may be blue. There have been genetic defects attributed to double dapple breeding.",This breed is intelligent but not particularly easy to train since it has a curious nature and a mind of its own. It can be very difficult to overcome the hunting instinct and train the dog to come when called. Early socialisation is required in order for it to learn to get along with cats and other dogs. Socialisation will also help it overcome its natural wariness with strangers.,"The Dachshund can be fed dry or wet food once or twice a day. They can be greedy so be very careful to not overfeed as an overweight Dachshund is at much greater risk of back problems and other issues. Long-haired require daily combing and brushings; wire-haired need professional trimming twice a year, and smooth-haired require regular rubdown with a damp cloth. If living in a place with a garden it must be very well fenced due to the above mentioned hunting instincts. Bear in mind that Dachshunds were bred to 'go to ground' and can dig under many types of fencing. These are active dogs with surprising stamina; they need to be walked for 20-40 minutes daily. They will also enjoy sessions of play in the park or other safe open areas. Be careful, however, when pedestrians are about because Dachshunds are more likely to be stepped on than more visible dogs.","The most important health consideration with Dachshunds is their spinal problems. Due to the elongated nature of the body, the spine is prone to injury. Disc rupture, often leading to paralysis, is a common problem in Dachshunds. Stairs and jumping on and off furniture must be avoided. Surgical intervention can sometimes help with this ailment but many Dachshunds have to resort to carts to haul their hind limbs. They can also be prone to skin ailments such as bald patches and lack of skin pigmentation. In addition, they are typically susceptible to ‘acanthosis nigricans’ a skin disease which causes a dark, thickened area especially at armpit. They are also prone to ‘pattern alopeica’ (patterned baldness). If kept at a reasonable weight the dachshund can stay healthy and active to a good age and reach a lifespan of 9 - 15 years. The average litter size is 5 to 6 puppies, although it is not unheard of for a bitch to whelp as much as 12 puppies.","('Hound',)",Singles City Dwellers Families with older children Hunters and outdoorsy types,Clever and curious Tirelessly energetic Always up for a walk or a game Affectionate
Miniature Pinscher,Small: Weight 8 – 10 lb (3.6 – 4.5 kg) Height 10 – 12” (25.4 – 30.5 cm),"The Miniature Pinscher originated in Germany. The breed’s earliest ancestors were a mix of Italian Greyhounds and Dachshunds. The misconception that the Miniature Pinscher is a “miniature doberman” occurred because the Doberman Pinscher was introduced in the US first. The Miniature Pinscher was introduced to the AKC show ring in 1919. At this time it was officially referred to in Germany as the Zwergpinscher (dwarf pinscher) but the AKC referred to it simply as Pinscher and it was listed in the miscellaneous category. The breed was officially introduced to the AKC in 1929 when the Miniature Pinscher Club of America (MPCA) petitioned for them to be placed in the Toy group. The name for this breed was officially changed to Miniature Pinscher in the US in 1972. The AKC’s description of the dog says that this breed is a “Miniature Doberman Pinscher” leading to the common misconception that this breed is a Miniature Doberman but is in fact, the older breed. Factual documentation of the breed begins less than 200 years ago but historical artifacts and paintings indicate the breed is very old. Miniature Pinscher’s were developed hundreds of years ago to help farmers keep away rats.","Miniature Pinschers are recommended for experienced dog owners as they are an assertive, outgoing, active and independent breed. They make great agility dogs are they are very energetic but they can be escape artists so need to be kept in secured, fenced in areas. They are alert and wary of strangers so they make good watch dogs. It is recommended they young children do not play with this breed as the Miniature Pinscher does not appreciate rough playing.","This breed is quite highly strung and needs calm, patient socialisation and training. They are good learners but need a routine to keep them under control. They are happy with children provided the play is not too rough or boisterous and the Miniature Pinscher values its own personal space. They are extremely loyal and protective of their household. Their senses are very acute and they are very aware of outside movement or noise making them good watch or guard dogs. They will bark loudly if sensing danger but can become territorial as they grow older so need good socialisation and training to prevent this.","The Miniature Pinscher is a sturdy, compact, short-coupled and smooth coated dog. They are proud, vigorous and alert. Characteristic traits are his hackney-like action, fearless animation, complete self-possession and spirited presence. Legs should be straight with no bending in or out. This breed frequently has a docked tail and cropped ears but the AKC no longer requires ear cropping for shoes. They have a narrow head, flat skull and strong muzzles. The eyes are oval and ears erect. The neck is arched and blends into the shoulders. The body is well-muscled and the tail is erect. Coat: The coat is short and smooth.","The colours allowed by the AKC are solid red, stag red, blue stag red, chocolate stag red, fawn stag red, and black, chocolate, blue and fawn with tan points and rust tan points. Occasionally they will have a small white patch located on the neck or breast area.  The Miniature Pinscher once came in harlequin like that is found in the Great Dance. The harlequin gene is part of the makeup of this breed; though breeders for years have worked to eliminate this gene, but breeders have recently been breeding to bring the colour back by mixing the Rat Terrier into the Miniature Pinscher, though they are merle and not harlequin because they do not have the harlequin modifier or any white besides the small white patch on the breast area",They do not need an excessive amount of training but should not be spoiled. Too much pandering can allow them to become bossy so they need a firm but loving hand to keep their ego in check.,"Their smooth short-haired coat requires little attention with only occasional brushing and shampooing. In cold weather care must be taken, jumpers or blankets can prevent the Miniature Pinscher from getting too cold. This is an active breed which needs access to a fenced yard or a daily walk.","Health: The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 15 years.

Care: Although your Poodle doesn’t shed his coat onto the floor like other dogs, he sheds it into his own coat , so he will need a thorough grooming every day as the curls can quickly become tangled and matted. There are various styles of clip, and if you intend to show your Poodle, check with your Kennel Club as to which clip is desirable. If you don’t want to be bothered with all that, an all over “pet clip” saves a lot of time and trouble, then you can easily care for him at home with a visit to the grooming parlour every couple of months to keep him looking his best. Prone to ear infections, like other long eared breeds, make sure you keep his ears clean too. Health: Your Poodle is a healthy breed, and should have a trouble free, long life of up to 15 years. Poodles have a predisposition towards Addison’s Disease, and like many deep chested breeds, can suffer from Bloat (Gastric Torsion). They can also develop geriatric cancer. By far the most common cause of death in Poodles is sheer old age! So don’t worry, your Poodle should give you years and years of laughter and love.

Neapolitan Mastiff,not available,"An ancient breed, the Neapolitan Mastiff's lineage can be traced back to ancient Egypt, Persia, Mesopotamia and Asia - to the dogs of war used by the Roman army. The breed later existed on estates and farms in northern Italy, designed to be imposing in appearance for use as a defender of owner and property. Even Alexander The Great admired the strength of these dogs and brought them to his kingdom in Greece and helped create the Mastiff we have today. With the Tibetan Mastiff acting as the primal source for them all, is hard to say, but it is certain that throughout the ancient civilisations, the forebears of the Neapolitan Mastiff were highly valued fighting dogs of the early courts, palaces and warrior leaders, they fought anything, guarded everything and, in suitable armour, even went to war. When the Romans conquered Greece, they adopted the Molossus Dogs and also used them in battle, in the hunt and in the arena. The Roman invasion of England gave them access to the even larger giant Mastiff dogs there, which the Romans crossed with their own now formidable war beasts. The several different breeds that are descended from these dogs originating in many different European countries, have many traits in common: they are large powerful animals, are devoted to their masters, and are superior defenders of person and property.","Steady and solid as an oak tree, the Neo is a guardian rather than an attack dog. He's always alert and aware, even if it looks like he's relaxing. If you aren't home, they simply won't let anyone onto your property. And really, who's going to argue with them? The Neapolitan Mastiff should be even tempered, loyal, vigilant, intelligent and slightly aloof. The movement is an important characteristic which could be compared to the motion of large mammals, when pacing the Neapolitan moves like a bear, and when trotting he moves like a lion. Neapolitan Mastiffs are not attack dogs and should never be trained to be so. When you welcome someone, though, your Neo will accept that person as well, although he'll probably remain aloof. This isn't a ""hail fellow, well met"" kind of dog. The Neo is affectionate toward his family, but he's also strong-willed--and big enough to have his own way. Whist they move in a slow, lumbered fashion and can strike fear into the hearts of passers-by, but they are really big babies with hearts of gold. Not to put it past them though as they are fiercely protective of the ones they love, but generally they are giant love bugs wanting nothing more than a cuddle. Making the deepest bonds with their favourite people, they are both loving and patient as well with older children","The Neapolitan Mastiff is steady and loyal to his owner, not aggressive or apt to bite without reason. Problems arise when the other dog’s postures back. Mastinos are not fight starters, but they will not back down if challenged. As a protector of his property and owners, he is always watchful and does not relish intrusion by strangers into his personal space. His attitude is calm yet wary. In the show ring he is majestic and powerful, but not showy. While his appearance is unnerving, looks are deceiving. The Neo, as he's often nicknamed, has a reputation for being an affectionate 200-pound lap dog. He is a constant guardian with an intimidating stare that he directs toward strangers, but he's far from being a fighting dog. Steady and loyal, his primary goal is to be with his people. He'll defend them with ferocity if need be","Neapolitan Mastiffs are a rare purebred that originated near Naples and descend directly from the Tibetan Mastiff, the king of all the mastiff dogs. The Neapolitan Mastiff is an estate guard dog from Italy. The breed traces its roots to the dogs of war used by the Roman Army. The breed then existed on estates and farms across Italy for the past two millennia, known as the ""big dog of the little man"" -- the extraordinary dog of the ordinary man. Large and powerful, Neapolitan Mastiffs are known for their massiveness - massive head, massive bone, and massive body. Despite their fierce appearance and serious demeanor, Mastini are generally peaceful, steady dogs. The breed's trademark is the loose skin that covers their bodies, the abundant wrinkles and folds on the head and their rolling and lumbering gait.

Average weight of mature Dogs: 150 pounds; Bitches: 110 pounds; Popularity: As a unique breed and we must understand clearly one thing: the Neapolitan Mastiff is not like any other breed of dog, it's not alike in type, it's not alike in build, it's not alike in movement, it's not alike in terms of temperament or character. While the Neapolitan Mastiff has been recognized as a breed in the modern world only since recognition by the FCI in 1949, we can see, through bas-relief, paintings and statues dating from 3000 years before Christ, that his roots trace to the giant war dogs of Egypt, Persia, Mesopotamia and Asia. Even as grand a figure as Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) was instrumental in creating the modern Neapolitan Mastiff. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>
    Also know as - Mastino Neapolitano, Italian Mastiff, Mastino Breed History: An ancient breed, the Neapolitan Mastiff's lineage can be traced back to ancient Egypt, Persia, Mesopotamia and Asia - to the dogs of war used by the Roman army. The breed later existed on estates and farms in northern Italy, designed to be imposing in appearance for use as a defender of owner and property. Even Alexander The Great admired the strength of these dogs and brought them to his kingdom in Greece and helped create the Mastiff we have today. With the Tibetan Mastiff acting as the primal source for them all, is hard to say, but it is certain that throughout the ancient civilisations, the forebears of the Neapolitan Mastiff were highly valued fighting dogs of the early courts, palaces and warrior leaders, they fought anything, guarded everything and, in suitable armour, even went to war. When the Romans conquered Greece, they adopted the Molossus Dogs and also used them in battle, in the hunt and in the arena. The Roman invasion of England gave them access to the even larger giant Mastiff dogs there, which the Romans crossed with their own now formidable war beasts. The several different breeds that are descended from these dogs originating in many different European countries, have many traits in common: they are large powerful animals, are devoted to their masters, and are superior defenders of person and property. Character: Steady and solid as an oak tree, the Neo is a guardian rather than an attack dog. He's always alert and aware, even if it looks like he's relaxing. If you aren't home, they simply won't let anyone onto your property. And really, who's going to argue with them? The Neapolitan Mastiff should be even tempered, loyal, vigilant, intelligent and slightly aloof. The movement is an important characteristic which could be compared to the motion of large mammals, when pacing the Neapolitan moves like a bear, and when trotting he moves like a lion. Neapolitan Mastiffs are not attack dogs and should never be trained to be so. When you welcome someone, though, your Neo will accept that person as well, although he'll probably remain aloof. This isn't a ""hail fellow, well met"" kind of dog. The Neo is affectionate toward his family, but he's also strong-willed--and big enough to have his own way. Whist they move in a slow, lumbered fashion and can strike fear into the hearts of passers-by, but they are really big babies with hearts of gold. Not to put it past them though as they are fiercely protective of the ones they love, but generally they are giant love bugs wanting nothing more than a cuddle. Making the deepest bonds with their favourite people, they are both loving and patient as well with older children Temperament: The Neapolitan Mastiff is steady and loyal to his owner, not aggressive or apt to bite without reason. Problems arise when the other dog’s postures back. Mastinos are not fight starters, but they will not back down if challenged. As a protector of his property and owners, he is always watchful and does not relish intrusion by strangers into his personal space. His attitude is calm yet wary. In the show ring he is majestic and powerful, but not showy. While his appearance is unnerving, looks are deceiving. The Neo, as he's often nicknamed, has a reputation for being an affectionate 200-pound lap dog. He is a constant guardian with an intimidating stare that he directs toward strangers, but he's far from being a fighting dog. Steady and loyal, his primary goal is to be with his people. He'll defend them with ferocity if need be Conformation: Neapolitan Mastiffs are a rare purebred that originated near Naples and descend directly from the Tibetan Mastiff, the king of all the mastiff dogs. The Neapolitan Mastiff is an estate guard dog from Italy. The breed traces its roots to the dogs of war used by the Roman Army. The breed then existed on estates and farms across Italy for the past two millennia, known as the ""big dog of the little man"" -- the extraordinary dog of the ordinary man. Large and powerful, Neapolitan Mastiffs are known for their massiveness - massive head, massive bone, and massive body. Despite their fierce appearance and serious demeanor, Mastini are generally peaceful, steady dogs. The breed's trademark is the loose skin that covers their bodies, the abundant wrinkles and folds on the head and their rolling and lumbering gait. Their short coats can by gray (blue), black, mahogany and tawny. Traits that make the Mastino an unusual dog: its wrinkles, dewlap, loose skin, enormous bone, and distinct lumbering gait, are created by an accumulation of recessive genes.

However, it could also be the beginning of an overwhelming responsibility, which you need to make sure you are prepared for! Neapolitan Mastiffs are high maintenance, time consuming, smelly, slobbery and because of their size, are constantly under your feet! Neapolitans are also devoted, loving, loyal, charismatic companions, gentle giants with their family, fearful foe to the intruder. Neapolitans are generally very good with children especially if raised with them but, they can be a bit clumsy and at times excitable, so great care should be taken around babies and toddlers Well-bred and socialized Mastiff’s are steady and loyal to their own families but protective around strangers. Due to the breed’s size, strength and temperament, experts do not recommend a Neapolitan Mastiff for first-time dog owners or families with young children. Their short coats are easy to care for, but potential owners should not be afraid of a little drool! Neos aren't especially suited for life in an apartment or condo unless they have room to sprawl. Otherwise, they're likely to shove your furniture out of place or knock objects over in their attempts to find a comfortable resting spot. When it comes to living with a Neo, neat freaks need not apply. The Neo drools after eating or drinking or when he's nervous, and he's notorious for passing gas. Keep a small hand towel for wipeups and a can of air freshener nearby at all times. On the plus side, he's a quiet dog who rarely barks. Neapolitan Mastiffs make wonderful companions; they are not dogs that should be left to their own devices outside or chained-up all day long. They are loving animals that thrive on human companionship.

Newfoundland,not available,"The Newfoundland developed on the island from which it takes its name in Canada. It is almost certainly a combination of the ancient, native Indian dogs and the many European breeds, which were carried across the Atlantic by explorers and fishermen from the 15th century onwards. By the end of the 17th century this ""cocktail"" had stabilized into a large, web-footed, thick coated dog, capable of draught and water work.  In Newfoundland he was used as a working dog to pull nets for the fishermen and to haul wood from the forest. He also did heavy labor, such as powering the blacksmith's bellows. Now days the modern newfie no longer works, although in Europe they can still be seen jumping out of helicopters and assisting the lifeguards, in the UK there is a working lifeguard newfie in Cornwall. Imported in considerable numbers throughout Europe, these dogs soon attracted the attention of rich people, who brought them to ornament their estates and entertain (and watch over) their children.","Loyal and intelligent, the Newfoundland is a wonderful working partner and dependable, sweet-natured family pet. Newfoundland’s are large draught and water dog, with a natural life saving instinct and a devoted companion due to their exceptionally gentle and docile nature. Its useful qualities were soon recognized well beyond the North American continent, as was its equable temperament, which meant it worked well with other dogs and was easily trained. He's like a big, loveable Teddy Bear. He loves children, is intelligent, and aims to please. He's happiest when he is with his family, and should not be left alone for long periods of time or be banished to the backyard or a kennel.","The Newfoundland is a sweet-dispositional dog that acts neither dull nor ill tempered. Sweetness of temperament is the hallmark of the Newfoundland; this is the most important single characteristic of the breed. He is a devoted companion.

The Newfoundland is a giant breed, but with a passion for its human companions, mostly laid back but can have a streak of mischief when the mood takes them, they are generally very good with other animals to the point of lying flat so a smaller dog can come close without being too intimidated by the sheer mass of the shaggy dog they have seen. Do not be complacent as these dogs are powerful (and can be known to suffer from Newfoundland deaf ear, in other words I hear you but I will ignore you and do my own thing) Amazing with children they are actually nicknamed ‘the babysitter’ for their protective, gentle nature.

He is known for his sterling gentleness and serenity.","The Newfoundland is a large, heavily coated, well balanced dog that is deep-bodied, heavily boned, muscular, and strong. A good specimen of the breed has dignity and proud head carriage. A true workhorse, the Newfoundland is a master at long-distance swimming and has true lifesaving instincts in the water.

As might be predicted, given their large size, Newfies can suffer from a number of joint and structural problems. It's important that young, growing dogs be kept lean and not allowed to exercise too strenuously or eat too much, as this will lead to injuries and problems. One such structural problem is the genetic hip deformity known as hip dysplasia. Newfoundland’s are at risk for heart disease, including dilated cardiomyopathy and subaortic stenosis. Cystinuria is a genetic kidney defect that leads to the formation of bladder stones that are very difficult to manage with diet or medication and often requires surgery both to remove the stones from the bladder and to repair urinary blockages.

The breed prospered in the United Kingdom, until 1914 and again in 1939, when its numbers were almost fatally depleted by wartime restrictions. Since the 1950's there has been a steady increase in numbers and popularity, while still remaining a relatively uncommon breed, this is not least because a Newfoundland's great size and fondness for playing around in mud and water make it very unsuitable for most homes. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3> Breed History: The Newfoundland developed on the island from which it takes its name in Canada.

Cystinuria is a genetic kidney defect that leads to the formation of bladder stones that are very difficult to manage with diet or medication and often requires surgery both to remove the stones from the bladder and to repair urinary blockages. Keeping a Newfie at an appropriate weight is one of the easiest ways to extend his life.

Although he appears somewhat docile, he is an active dog and will need daily exercise. Regular brushing is important to maintain his plush coat. Newfoundland’s are also an intelligent breed and are readily trained, they are known for their sweet and easy going temperament. Generally speaking, a Newfoundland blends into new situations easily and warms to strangers quickly. This is not to say you will never meet an aggressive Newfoundland - just as with any breed of dog, there are exceptions. But Newfoundland’s are truly known to most as being a gentle giant. Owners usually receive a lot of attention, especially when taking their Newfie out for a stroll around the block. People are very interested in such a large dog and often have many questions to ask. When you combine a Newfie's calm disposition with their amazing strength, you get a dog that will safely pull young children around in a cart, much like a horse. Newfoundland’s love to play and cuddle with people of all ages, and will grow quite attached to their family. A few cons most obviously are their size can be a deterrent. A 150-pound dog that thinks he's a ""lap dog"" or still behaves as a puppy can be difficult for smaller humans to manage. Newfs take up a significant amount of space, which is definitely something potential owners need to consider. Families that pride themselves on having an immaculate house are probably not the right owners for the Newfoundland dog. As with many other giant breeds, Newfoundland’s drool almost constantly. Newfoundland’s do well in cold climates, and are not so fond of the hot summer. If you live in a hot climate, you will need to make adjustments for this large animal. It might mean keeping him indoors in air conditioning constantly, or clipping his coat ultra short. Large breeds are very sensitive to hotter weather and their owner must be very careful to not let them overheat. It is very important that a Newfoundland goes through obedience training as soon as he is able. It is imperative that their owner learns to control him as a puppy, because as he grows, an untrained  Newfoundland becomes more difficult to handle.

A CamTab named ""the Jones terrier"" is considered the foresire of the breeds. By the 1930s, quarrels by dog breeders as to what the ideal terrier would look like split the breed into the Norwich and Norfolk terriers. The Norfolk terrier shares an identical early history with the Norwich terrier. During the development of these breeds, both prick and drop ears were seen, and neither could lay claim to being more authentic or original than the other. In the 1930s, soon after their entry into the show rings, breeders found that crossing the two types of ear carriage resulted in uncertain ear carriage in the offspring, so they began avoiding crossing the two ear types. The prick-eared type was more numerous; in fact, the drop-eared type almost vanished during World War II. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>

Norwegian Buhund,not available,"The Norwegian Buhund is an ancient breed. A member of the spitz family it travelled as companion and guard of the Vikings and is thought to be behind many other herding breeds such as the Icelandic sheepdog.  The breed is one of a number of dogs loosely referred to as being of the “spitz type.” “Spitz” refers generally to so-called “Northern” or “Nordic” dog breeds that have conformational characteristics resembling those of wolves. The breed’s name is derived from the old Norwegian term 'bu' which refers to such concepts as farm, hut and livestock thus indicating the Buhund’s original use as a farm and herding dog. Its ancestors date back to about 900 AD, when the skeletons of six dogs closely resembling Buhunds were found in a Viking grave at the Gokstad excavation in Norway. According to historical reports, when Vikings died, their most treasured possessions were buried with them, to provide care and comfort in the afterlife. Dogs were among the most cherished of all Viking possessions. The Vikings travelled with their Buhunds on all of their journeys, both by land and by sea.","The Norwegian Buhund is a good, friendly family dog, and is usually good-natured and loyal. It is very active and needs exercise and stimulation. It is a very loving breed and is never happier than when it is on your knee being cuddled. A brave, dynamic, noisy dog, with very developed senses (hearing, smell, seeing), it is watchful and attentive. Devoted and affectionate with the family, it accepts the children. It gets along good with other dogs and other animals from the household. The strangers are just announced. Buhunds are intelligent and love to learn, many work as hearing dogs for the deaf and as dogs for the disabled so if you are looking for a couch potato do not look here. He’s a happy-go-lucky breed that plays vigorously, yet is also light on his feet and very agile. More than some other spitz breeds, he likes to be at the center of his family, demanding (and offering) a great deal of companionship. Most Norwegian Buhunds are friendly (or at least polite) with strangers, yet with their keen senses and watchful attitude, they make dependable alarm dogs. Buhunds are usually fine with other family pets if raised with them. The Norwegian Buhund is less headstrong and more willing to work with you than other spitzes, but he is still independent and may use his intelligence in clever ways that suit his own purposes. Yet owners who know how to lead will find him eminently trainable. Like most herding breeds, the Norwegian Buhund is uncomfortable when his flock (family members and other pets) is scattered every which way.

If trained correctly they can be very obedient though you will have to be very dedicated to achieve success with a Buhund if you intend to do obedience work seriously. The Buhund is a clever dog, he will discover your weak spots even before you are aware of them. The instinct to work is still present, so if you live in an area where there is livestock you must be prepared to make doubly sure that your Buhund is not allowed to wander as anything on four legs could be chased and a farmer will not hesitate to shoot at the dog he thinks is worrying livestock, whether it is or not. A dog, which is off the lead, is not under control as far as the law is concerned. Most Buhund owners who have owned both sexes will agree that unlike many breeds, the males tend to be more affectionate and loyal than the bitches. The bitches tend to be very self possessed and often prefer their own company, whereas a male will be quite happy to spend all his time in your company. Both dogs and bitches can have a very strong guarding instinct, and in both sexes this must be discouraged right from the beginning or the over-indulgent owner may well find that the dog considers some part of the house to be exclusively his, rather than his owner's. Buhunds usually adapt effortlessly to a wide variety of new situations and are not known to be suspicious or wary around strangers. They are not high-strung, fussy or clingy dogs, nor are they overly boisterous or pushy.

    Also known as the Norwegian Sheepdog, Norsk Buhund or Nordiske Sitz-hunde Breed History: The Norwegian Buhund is an ancient breed. A member of the spitz family it travelled as companion and guard of the Vikings and is thought to be behind many other herding breeds such as the Icelandic sheepdog.  The breed is one of a number of dogs loosely referred to as being of the “spitz type.” “Spitz” refers generally to so-called “Northern” or “Nordic” dog breeds that have conformational characteristics resembling those of wolves. The breed’s name is derived from the old Norwegian term 'bu' which refers to such concepts as farm, hut and livestock thus indicating the Buhund’s original use as a farm and herding dog. Its ancestors date back to about 900 AD, when the skeletons of six dogs closely resembling Buhunds were found in a Viking grave at the Gokstad excavation in Norway. According to historical reports, when Vikings died, their most treasured possessions were buried with them, to provide care and comfort in the afterlife. Dogs were among the most cherished of all Viking possessions. The Vikings travelled with their Buhunds on all of their journeys, both by land and by sea. Character: The Norwegian Buhund is a good, friendly family dog, and is usually good-natured and loyal. It is very active and needs exercise and stimulation. It is a very loving breed and is never happier than when it is on your knee being cuddled. A brave, dynamic, noisy dog, with very developed senses (hearing, smell, seeing), it is watchful and attentive. Devoted and affectionate with the family, it accepts the children. It gets along good with other dogs and other animals from the household. The strangers are just announced. Buhunds are intelligent and love to learn, many work as hearing dogs for the deaf and as dogs for the disabled so if you are looking for a couch potato do not look here. He’s a happy-go-lucky breed that plays vigorously, yet is also light on his feet and very agile. More than some other spitz breeds, he likes to be at the center of his family, demanding (and offering) a great deal of companionship. Most Norwegian Buhunds are friendly (or at least polite) with strangers, yet with their keen senses and watchful attitude, they make dependable alarm dogs. Buhunds are usually fine with other family pets if raised with them. The Norwegian Buhund is less headstrong and more willing to work with you than other spitzes, but he is still independent and may use his intelligence in clever ways that suit his own purposes. Yet owners who know how to lead will find him eminently trainable. Like most herding breeds, the Norwegian Buhund is uncomfortable when his flock (family members and other pets) is scattered every which way. He may try to gather everyone together by circling, poking, and nipping. He barks a lot in a rapid, high-pitched voice. Because of their independent minds, they are not pushovers to raise and train. They are often manipulative, and some are willful and obstinate. You must show them, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say.

Norwegian Elk hound,not available,"The Norwegian Elkhound originated in the breathtakingly beautiful and rugged country of Norway. He can be traced back roughly a thousand years, where a breed of dog similar in shape and size was used by the Vikings to guard and hunt. The elkhound is an unusual hound because its roots lie in the spitz breeds, which it still closely resembles. This breed's placement in the hound group reflects its hunting ability because it hunts like a hound. Still, the elkhound is a breed of many skills. It's possible that the breed may reach back as far as 5000 BCE, The Norwegian Elkhound has been a common fixture in the history of not only the Vikings but of Norwegian culture in general. The breed has been used to guard herds, flocks, and homes; and to hunt large game such as bear and moose. His role in hunting was to first track down his prey and then to hold it at bay by barking until the hunter could arrive to kill the animal. In a land of subzero temperatures, deep snow, thick forests and rugged mountains, only the hardiest of breeds could evolve to perform the variety of jobs at which the elkhound excels. Of all its roles, hunting elk (actually, moose) is this breed's forte. Although the breed had been carefully bred for centuries, only since the late 1800s were pedigrees kept and breeding according to standard performed.","Norwegian Elkhounds are affectionate dogs that make devoted, wonderful family members. They're excellent with children and are terrific watch dogs, treating strangers with natural suspicion. They thrive on attention, and it's hard to find a more loyal companion. Once an Elkhound bonds to you, though, you'll be an inseparable pair as far as he's concerned. Norwegian Elkhounds are strong-willed enough that they can take over a home if they're allowed half a chance. They love the dominant role, and without proper training and socialization, this can become a problem He’s a capable, confident dog with a strong presence, whose self-reliance requires supervision and leadership. The Norwegian Elkhound is a bundle of energy just waiting for the signal to go, yet when well trained he can control himself. This rugged breed plays hard and enjoys vigorous exercise, and can portray rowdiness and exuberance as a pup. Thus meaning a strong, confident owner is required to enable dominance in the pack with owner being alpha and taking leadership.","Bold, energetic and very protective, this breed makes an excellent watchdog and guardian, showing complete devotion to their families. When you’re upset this tenderhearted Viking will rest his head on lap in consonance. Independent thinkers, these extroverted clowns like to be where the action is. They see themselves as coexisting with you--not necessarily underneath you in the chain of command. They can be hard to train because of that independence, but they can get it if you're firm and consistent. If you're not a firm person, however, this dog will walk all over you. Amazingly devoted, he's protective if not outright possessive of his family. Attached and loyal, he's happiest to be with you all the time and dotes on your attention and interaction. A born watchdog but not aggressive by nature, his bark provides a level of safety from intruders. This breed is known for his barking, and although this trait can be trained out of some, don’t bet on it with an Elk. The Norwegian elkhound combines traits of hounds and spitz-like dogs, resulting in a breed that is bold, playful, independent, alert, boisterous and — unlike most hounds — even protective Elkhounds are naturally noisy and rambunctious, even when exercised properly. They have a tendency to jump on people, so it is imperative to teach them “down” They love to hear themselves bark, and though they are not aggressive, will bark to let you know someone is approaching. Separation Anxiety can often develop in this breed. Elkhounds love to be with their families and when left alone too long can bark excessively and become destructive.","The Norwegian Elk is a hardy hunting Spitz with a bold energetic disposition. With a powerful, compact body; square outline and proud carriage; coat close and abundant but not open; upstanding pointed ears; and a tail tightly curled over its back.  An extremely intelligent, friendly dog with an independent nature without any trace of nervousness. His movement demonstrates great agility and endurance; his stride at a trot is even and effortless. He is a gorgeous dog with an almost wolf like face, smart as can be and demonstrates a great sense of humour. It has a thick, smooth-lying coat consisting of straight outer hairs and a wooly undercoat. This combination presents the best protection against cold and snow. Naturally, they prefer a winter climate with lots of snow to play in. A true adventurer, the Elkhound wants his adventure to occur outdoors. Long daily exercise is a necessity; so if you're not ready to turn your couch potato ways into those of an outdoorsman, think twice--if you can't keep up, you'll soon be met with a house full of destroyed belongings that met their fates as he found ways to expend his endless energy. Not surprisingly, the Elkhound excels at fast-moving performance events such as agility. One thing to remember is they can be aggressive with other dogs of the same sex and may be cat chasers unless raised with the family cat.",Silver and Grey,"Norwegian Elkhounds are strong-willed enough that they can take over a home if they're allowed half a chance. They love the dominant role, and without proper training and socialization, this can become a problem. Training can be difficult, and they need a firm and consistent owner. What this background means to the average dog owner is that exacting obedience work just isn't in the picture. He'll be fine in basic obedience and he makes a great family dog, but understands clearly that pleasing you is not the highest item on his to-do list. This is no Golden Retriever, so go get your own slippers. Toys are generally of no interest. He loves chasing balls, but you can forget about him bringing them back to you. Like every dog, the Elkhound needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Elkhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.","The Norwegian Elkhound requires daily exercise (breeders recommend 30 minutes twice a day), not only to burn off energy but also to help him maintain a healthy weight as some can be exceptionally food motivated and obsessive can lead to over weight dogs. A healthy Elkhound will live up to the age of 15 years old and maybe longer as these dogs usually enjoy a robust health. They can be quite gluttonous dogs, and as such if they do not receive the correct balance of food versus exercise, they can have a tendency to put on weight. Seek advice from your vet with regards to the best nutrition plan for your dog in this case. He will do fine in an apartments if he's properly exercised, but the ideal setting is a large, fenced yard. Despite his outdoor hardiness, he needs to live indoors with his family. Elkhounds molt quite profusely. Their coat does not need trimming. Keep him wiped clean with a damp cloth, and when he molts, comb and brush out the loose coat. If you can brush and comb him daily, he will look really first class. An occasional bath and shampoo will be necessary, followed by brisk toweling with his own towel.","Elkhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Elkhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed. The ones to look out for is an inherited disease that affects the kidneys called fanconi syndrome. Another is hypothyroidism, which is a thyroid gland disorder. Others that should be checked for include sebaceous cysts, which can form under the dogs skin, and a progressive retinal atrophy, which is a form of eye disease.",not available,Outdoors type Active Dominant Firm Experienced,"Playful Hardy Bold Alert Willed Smart Is this Norwegian Elk hound for you?

Average weight: 23-37kg for males and females up to 23kg. Popularity: The Norwegian Elkhound became a breed of interest after the Norwegian Hunters Association held its first dog show in 1877. Shortly thereafter, breeders began an effort to create a breed standard and records, and to also shape the Norwegian Elkhound into a serious competitor in the conformation ring. Today, the Norwegian Elkhound makes a wonderful family companion and does well in a variety of dog sports and careers, including conformation, agility, obedience, fly ball, freestyle, tracking, guarding, herding, sledding, and search and rescue. Norwegian Elkhounds are still used in their original capacity as hunting dogs as well. The AKC recognized the breed around 1930, and it has enjoyed moderate popularity since then. In Scandinavia, the elkhound is still tested by grueling elk hunts that may entail an entire day of trailing. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3> Breed History: The Norwegian Elkhound originated in the breathtakingly beautiful and rugged country of Norway.

Temperament: Bold, energetic and very protective, this breed makes an excellent watchdog and guardian, showing complete devotion to their families. When you’re upset this tenderhearted Viking will rest his head on lap in consonance. Independent thinkers, these extroverted clowns like to be where the action is. They see themselves as coexisting with you--not necessarily underneath you in the chain of command. They can be hard to train because of that independence, but they can get it if you're firm and consistent. If you're not a firm person, however, this dog will walk all over you. Amazingly devoted, he's protective if not outright possessive of his family. Attached and loyal, he's happiest to be with you all the time and dotes on your attention and interaction. A born watchdog but not aggressive by nature, his bark provides a level of safety from intruders. This breed is known for his barking, and although this trait can be trained out of some, don’t bet on it with an Elk. The Norwegian elkhound combines traits of hounds and spitz-like dogs, resulting in a breed that is bold, playful, independent, alert, boisterous and — unlike most hounds — even protective Elkhounds are naturally noisy and rambunctious, even when exercised properly. They have a tendency to jump on people, so it is imperative to teach them “down” They love to hear themselves bark, and though they are not aggressive, will bark to let you know someone is approaching. Separation Anxiety can often develop in this breed. Elkhounds love to be with their families and when left alone too long can bark excessively and become destructive. Conformation: The Norwegian Elk is a hardy hunting Spitz with a bold energetic disposition. With a powerful, compact body; square outline and proud carriage; coat close and abundant but not open; upstanding pointed ears; and a tail tightly curled over its back.  An extremely intelligent, friendly dog with an independent nature without any trace of nervousness. His movement demonstrates great agility and endurance; his stride at a trot is even and effortless. He is a gorgeous dog with an almost wolf like face, smart as can be and demonstrates a great sense of humour. It has a thick, smooth-lying coat consisting of straight outer hairs and a wooly undercoat. This combination presents the best protection against cold and snow. Naturally, they prefer a winter climate with lots of snow to play in. A true adventurer, the Elkhound wants his adventure to occur outdoors. Long daily exercise is a necessity; so if you're not ready to turn your couch potato ways into those of an outdoorsman, think twice--if you can't keep up, you'll soon be met with a house full of destroyed belongings that met their fates as he found ways to expend his endless energy. Not surprisingly, the Elkhound excels at fast-moving performance events such as agility. One thing to remember is they can be aggressive with other dogs of the same sex and may be cat chasers unless raised with the family cat. Colour: Silver and Grey Training: Norwegian Elkhounds are strong-willed enough that they can take over a home if they're allowed half a chance. They love the dominant role, and without proper training and socialization, this can become a problem. Training can be difficult, and they need a firm and consistent owner. What this background means to the average dog owner is that exacting obedience work just isn't in the picture. He'll be fine in basic obedience and he makes a great family dog, but understands clearly that pleasing you is not the highest item on his to-do list. This is no Golden Retriever, so go get your own slippers. Toys are generally of no interest. He loves chasing balls, but you can forget about him bringing them back to you. Like every dog, the Elkhound needs early socialization--exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences--when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Elkhound puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog. Care: The Norwegian Elkhound requires daily exercise (breeders recommend 30 minutes twice a day), not only to burn off energy but also to help him maintain a healthy weight as some can be exceptionally food motivated and obsessive can lead to over weight dogs. A healthy Elkhound will live up to the age of 15 years old and maybe longer as these dogs usually enjoy a robust health. They can be quite gluttonous dogs, and as such if they do not receive the correct balance of food versus exercise, they can have a tendency to put on weight. Seek advice from your vet with regards to the best nutrition plan for your dog in this case. He will do fine in an apartments if he's properly exercised, but the ideal setting is a large, fenced yard. Despite his outdoor hardiness, he needs to live indoors with his family. Elkhounds molt quite profusely. Their coat does not need trimming. Keep him wiped clean with a damp cloth, and when he molts, comb and brush out the loose coat. If you can brush and comb him daily, he will look really first class. An occasional bath and shampoo will be necessary, followed by brisk toweling with his own towel. Health: Elkhounds are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Elkhounds will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed. The ones to look out for is an inherited disease that affects the kidneys called fanconi syndrome. Another is hypothyroidism, which is a thyroid gland disorder. Others that should be checked for include sebaceous cysts, which can form under the dogs skin, and a progressive retinal atrophy, which is a form of eye disease.

He is a courageous and loyal companion possessing an exceptionally high degree of intelligence, which enables him to match his quick wits against anything or anyone, and win! Herein lies a danger for the new owner, who must remember that Elkhounds love being part of a family and joining in family life. This “pack” loyalty must be utilised to the full. Consistent firm and loving handling is needed to enable him to learn the family rules, and to make him understand his role as a member for the pack, and not its leader.

Norwegian Terrier,not available,"The Norwegian Buhund is an ancient breed. A member of the spitz family it travelled as companion and guard of the Vikings and is thought to be behind many other herding breeds such as the Icelandic sheepdog.  The breed is one of a number of dogs loosely referred to as being of the “spitz type.” “Spitz” refers generally to so-called “Northern” or “Nordic” dog breeds that have conformational characteristics resembling those of wolves. The breed’s name is derived from the old Norwegian term 'bu' which refers to such concepts as farm, hut and livestock thus indicating the Buhund’s original use as a farm and herding dog. Its ancestors date back to about 900 AD, when the skeletons of six dogs closely resembling Buhunds were found in a Viking grave at the Gokstad excavation in Norway. According to historical reports, when Vikings died, their most treasured possessions were buried with them, to provide care and comfort in the afterlife. Dogs were among the most cherished of all Viking possessions. The Vikings travelled with their Buhunds on all of their journeys, both by land and by sea.","The Norwegian Buhund is a good, friendly family dog, and is usually good-natured and loyal. It is very active and needs exercise and stimulation. It is a very loving breed and is never happier than when it is on your knee being cuddled. A brave, dynamic, noisy dog, with very developed senses (hearing, smell, seeing), it is watchful and attentive. Devoted and affectionate with the family, it accepts the children. It gets along good with other dogs and other animals from the household. The strangers are just announced. Buhunds are intelligent and love to learn, many work as hearing dogs for the deaf and as dogs for the disabled so if you are looking for a couch potato do not look here. He’s a happy-go-lucky breed that plays vigorously, yet is also light on his feet and very agile. More than some other spitz breeds, he likes to be at the center of his family, demanding (and offering) a great deal of companionship. Most Norwegian Buhunds are friendly (or at least polite) with strangers, yet with their keen senses and watchful attitude, they make dependable alarm dogs. Buhunds are usually fine with other family pets if raised with them. The Norwegian Buhund is less headstrong and more willing to work with you than other spitzes, but he is still independent and may use his intelligence in clever ways that suit his own purposes. Yet owners who know how to lead will find him eminently trainable. Like most herding breeds, the Norwegian Buhund is uncomfortable when his flock (family members and other pets) is scattered every which way. He may try to gather everyone together by circling, poking, and nipping. He barks a lot in a rapid, high-pitched voice. Because of their independent minds, they are not pushovers to raise and train. They are often manipulative, and some are willful and obstinate. You must show them, through absolute consistency, that you mean what you say.","A well balanced, medium sized dog, free from exaggerations, and capable of arduous work. A Buhund’s eyes are a dark brown giving him a lively and fearless expression. The Norwegian Buhund makes an excellent housedog and their warning bark will deter unwelcome visitors despite their relatively small size. However, it is not in their nature to defend. If trained correctly they can be very obedient though you will have to be very dedicated to achieve success with a Buhund if you intend to do obedience work seriously. The Buhund is a clever dog, he will discover your weak spots even before you are aware of them. The instinct to work is still present, so if you live in an area where there is livestock you must be prepared to make doubly sure that your Buhund is not allowed to wander as anything on four legs could be chased and a farmer will not hesitate to shoot at the dog he thinks is worrying livestock, whether it is or not. A dog, which is off the lead, is not under control as far as the law is concerned. Most Buhund owners who have owned both sexes will agree that unlike many breeds, the males tend to be more affectionate and loyal than the bitches. The bitches tend to be very self possessed and often prefer their own company, whereas a male will be quite happy to spend all his time in your company. Both dogs and bitches can have a very strong guarding instinct, and in both sexes this must be discouraged right from the beginning or the over-indulgent owner may well find that the dog considers some part of the house to be exclusively his, rather than his owner's. Buhunds usually adapt effortlessly to a wide variety of new situations and are not known to be suspicious or wary around strangers. They are not high-strung, fussy or clingy dogs, nor are they overly boisterous or pushy. In fact, most Buhunds have an independent streak and tend to do just fine if they need to be left alone for a reasonable period of time. One thing to watch is like people some Buhunds take an instant dislike to certain other dogs, often for no apparent reason.","The Buhund is a little under middle size, squarely built and has a dense, flat-lying coat. The ears are pointed and erect and their shape and size should harmonize with the head. The tail is carried firmly curled over the back. The Norwegian Buhund hails from Norway, where he was responsible for herding livestock and guarding the farm. He has a trait that's rare among the Spitz breeds: a desire to please. Add in his intelligence and independence, and you get a highly trainable and capable dog. He can handle jobs ranging from hearing dog, to police dog, to competitor in agility and obedience trials. His alert nature and tendency to bark make him a good watchdog, although he's probably too friendly to pose any real threat. This is an active--some say tireless--breed who needs a lot of vigorous exercise and playtime daily. He's highly affectionate with his family, including the kids, and enjoys a cuddle on the couch as well as a romp in the park. Kind, consistent training is essential for this smart dog, as is family involvement. He won't want to be left out of anything!","Black, Wheaten, Red Wheaten","The dog’s need very firm handling from the start, as they are very likely to try to dominate their owners at some stage in their development, particularly when they are at the adolescent stage. Owning and training a puppy requires much hard work and patience. The puppy will need to be taught everything. House-training is not something nature teaches, Buhunds are usually quick to learn. The puppy will have to adapt to new people and surroundings and will, if given the opportunity go through a phase of testing its teeth on all sorts of things as all puppies do. Buhund puppies are also very energetic, often not realising that they are tired. No one ever told the Buhund that puppies should sleep for most of the day. The Buhund has been bred as a working farm dog for centuries and it is still bred to be an active dog, capable of arduous work. He will take as much exercise as you can give him, once he is fully grown, but, provided he is also mentally exercised, he will be equally happy with just a few short walks a day. Like most of the pastoral breeds, the Buhund is an intelligent dog and so easily becomes bored if left alone or ignored for long periods. When he is bored he is quite likely to cause trouble and become destructive. Likewise, while a Buhund will be quite happy to live part of his day in a kennel and run, if he does not receive sufficient attention he will simply bark at anything and nothing.","They are very hardy dogs, usually only going to the vet's for their boosters and they can stand the cold very well – although they do like a nice fire in the winter! Being a Scandinavian breed, they are not so happy in very hot weather and prefer to sleep away the hot days in a shady corner. They have a thick double coat consisting of a soft woolly undercoat and a topcoat of harsher, waterproof hair. Their coats need very little attention for most of the year, just a brush or comb tow or three times a week. Its average life span is 12 to 15 years.","Generally speaking the Buhund is a remarkable healthy breed and most will only visit the vet's for injections. They do have the occasional ear or eye infection and some tend to be more accident prone than others. Properly cared for, the Buhund should live an active life well into their teens. Until 1985 it was thought that, unlike most other breeds, a hereditary diseases did not affect the Buhund. However, it has been discovered that there is an incidence of Hereditary Cataract in the breed. In most cases the dog's sight is only minimally affected.

Norwich Terrier,not available,"Present day Norwich Terriers began life as a show breed in 1932 when, as the drop and prick-eared Norwich terrier, the breed was accepted on The Kennel Club Breed Register, but it is interesting to look at the breed's possible evolution. Historically, small terrier-type dogs were popular amongst the farming and sporting community in East Anglia to use on rats and other vermin which infested the marshy region. It is possible that some of these were the forerunners of the early Norwich terrier. Many types of terriers were bred in the process resulting in the Norwich terrier including a small Irish terrier, a Bedlington terrier to a Staffordshire bull terrier a one point. The little terriers became known as CanTab, and later Trumpington, terriers. Around 1900, a Trumpington terrier named Rags came to a stable near Norwich and gained notoriety as a ratter as well as sire. He sired countless offspring and is the patriarch of the modern Norwich. One of his sons came to America and proved to be an amiable ambassador for the breed. To this day, many people still refer to the Norwich as the ""Jones"" terrier, after this dog's owner. The Jones terrier was incorporated into various foxhound hunt packs. Although lacking the flash of its long-legged competitors in the terrier group, the Norwich has proven itself as formidable a competitor in the show ring as it ever was in the field.","The Norwich terrier is a courageous, loving companion, being one of the smallest of working terriers they are ideal for small living conditions and travel, yet they are study and lead active lives. They are by far not as quarrelsome as some of the other terrier types and can live quite harmoniously. The Norwich is a classic terrier breed: fearless, strong, sassy, loving and independent. They make excellent family dogs as they consider their family to be their “pack” and will want to be included in as many group activities as possible. They never tire of playing ball, and many owners report that their Norwich Terriers chased balls with the vigor of a puppy well into their older adult lifetimes. This breed has a zest for life, approaching new tasks and situations with vigor, and makes an excellent family pet, though they shouldn't be raised alongside toddlers. Their trainability and generally even temperament makes them a good choice for first time dog owners.","The Norwich terrier is known for his affectionate nature. He generally loves everyone and will do well in households with multiple pets and children. His sensitive intelligence and alert nature ensure that he'll bark an alarm if he spots anything or anyone suspicious near his home. Norwich Terriers have a mind of their own, but they generally enjoy life and enjoy pleasing both themselves and their owners. They are small, but that doesn't mean you should overindulge or coddle them. That simply leads to behavior problems. The Norwich is active and loves playing with balls and toys or just playing a good game with the people he loves. He thrives on the companionship of humans and will fit himself into your life completely. You can see the drive of the Norwich terrier in his day-to-day life: chasing squirrels and other rodents, bolting out doors and gates if unrestrained, and digging and barking for entertainment. These terrier habits can make him unsuited for the person or family who can't ensure these behaviors don't become a nuisance. On the plus side, he's loyal and alert, qualities that make him an excellent watchdog.  They are courageous, but they should never be aggressive. The breed is known for its loving and well-balanced nature and thrives on the companionship of the humans it loves. The Norwich terrier, like many terriers, enjoys digging but bear in mind it's easier to train a dog to dig in a specific area then it is to break him of his digging habit. Though they are less yappy than other terrier breeds, Norwich Terriers are still prone to barking, especially if left alone for long periods of time with nothing to do. Walking your dog before leaving the house, and leaving him with interesting toys to play with can cut down on the barking. Companion dogs also help. They are pack animals and when raised together, bond well with other canines.","Farmers, hunters and families alike value the Norwich’s gameness, loyalty, adaptability and great charm. Norwich Terriers were bred to hunt in packs or alone as ratters. They go to ground readily to seek and bolt their prey.

At that time, owning one of these small ratters became a fad among Cambridge University students. The AKC recognized the breed in 1936. At that time the breed had both prick and drop ears, but in 1979 the dropped-eared variety was recognized as a separate breed, the Norfolk terrier.

A playful type that was once bred to hunt, and shows those instincts to chase small prey as most terriers do. Although they are good with other household pets, caution should be taken with small animals. They must be well trained and good at recall to be allowed of the lead due to their strong desire to hunt and will follow a scent. But thankfully they are highly intelligent and relatively easy to train, but will require consistent rules. If you can cope with his high prey drive and tendencies to bark and dig, the Norwich terrier is a wonderful companion and friend who may surprise you with his versatility and athleticism.

Nova scotia retriever,not available,"The ancestors of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever of today have been recorded since at least the 1890s. The breed was further developed in the early part of the 20th century to lure and retrieve waterfowl. It is thought that they were the result of several crosses involving Golden, Chesapeake Bay, Labrador and Flat- Coated Retrievers. It is possible that they may also have small amounts of Cocker Spaniel, Irish setter, Working Collies and maybe even a variety or two of the spitz type breeds in them too. Although known by other names such as Little River Duck Dog and Yarmouth Toller, when first registered by the Canadian Kennel Club in the 1950s they were called the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. ‘Tolling’ is a hunting practice in which the dog lures waterfowl within range, and the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever proved to be especially good at it. Tollers lived and worked quietly in their native lands for hundreds of years, not making a splash in the U.S until the 1980s.","A dog that loves to work, the Toller loves being given tasks to do. They absolutely love to play, making them very good with children and other pets. They have a boundless energy which means they require sufficient exercise and aren’t suitable for small surroundings such as an apartment.","Sometimes the Toller is confused with the Golden Retriever as they have a similar wonderful temperament, but the Toller can be more wary around strangers and unfamiliar animals. Once socialized, this breed will do well with another four legged companion. The Toller has an intense drive and a strong love for water. Initially used to lure waterfowl within gunshot range, this breed has a strong double coat which endures cold water.","The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers coat comes in various shades of red and is of a soft medium length. The undercoat is dense and feathers out towards the hind quarters. This denseness ensures that its coat is not only water repellent, but can also withstand extreme temperatures. The Nova Scotia Retrievers’ body is muscular and sturdy with a deep chest and a short back. Its feet are round and webbed with arched toes. When active, this breed gives the impression of power as its back legs supply the drive and its front legs reach well out in front.","Various shades of red and orange, with lighter feathering and sometimes features of white.","This highly intelligent dog is agile and active. Training the breed is not difficult as this breed is very attentive and is obedient. Its high energy makes it fun-loving and a fast learner. The Toller has won many dog trials such as fly ball and agility, alongside showing a talent for tracking and obedience. Exercise: This dog requires a minimum of 2 hours exercise a day. They enjoy games to do with swimming and retrieving as this is their strong point. As long as this breed is sufficiently exercised they will remain happy. As the Toller is lively, they do best with a securely fenced yard.","The Toller requires simple grooming, such as regular brushing of their double coat and dry shampooing. Bathing regularly is not recommended as it will strip the coat of its natural oils which are needed if the coat is to remain water resistant. Puppies require a nutritious diet in order to ensure the proper formation of the bones and joints.","Although generally healthy, some Tollers can develop eye and thyroid problems. Symptoms of thyroid problems include weight gain, skin and hair problems. As 1 in 6 Tollers have been known to suffer from thyroid problems, it is best to know the signs and practice regular check-ups.  Hip Dysplasia is another common health issue amongst this breed. The Toller’s live expectancy ranges from 9-15 years.",not available,Active Singles Outdoorsy types Families,"Excellent Companion Devoted Loyal Playful Patient What do you think?

    Little River Duck Dog, Yarmouth Toller, NSDR, and Toller. Breed History: The ancestors of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever of today have been recorded since at least the 1890s. The breed was further developed in the early part of the 20th century to lure and retrieve waterfowl. It is thought that they were the result of several crosses involving Golden, Chesapeake Bay, Labrador and Flat- Coated Retrievers. It is possible that they may also have small amounts of Cocker Spaniel, Irish setter, Working Collies and maybe even a variety or two of the spitz type breeds in them too. Although known by other names such as Little River Duck Dog and Yarmouth Toller, when first registered by the Canadian Kennel Club in the 1950s they were called the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. ‘Tolling’ is a hunting practice in which the dog lures waterfowl within range, and the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever proved to be especially good at it. Tollers lived and worked quietly in their native lands for hundreds of years, not making a splash in the U.S until the 1980s. Character: A dog that loves to work, the Toller loves being given tasks to do. They absolutely love to play, making them very good with children and other pets. They have a boundless energy which means they require sufficient exercise and aren’t suitable for small surroundings such as an apartment. Temperament: Sometimes the Toller is confused with the Golden Retriever as they have a similar wonderful temperament, but the Toller can be more wary around strangers and unfamiliar animals. Once socialized, this breed will do well with another four legged companion. The Toller has an intense drive and a strong love for water. Initially used to lure waterfowl within gunshot range, this breed has a strong double coat which endures cold water. Conformation: The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers coat comes in various shades of red and is of a soft medium length. The undercoat is dense and feathers out towards the hind quarters. This denseness ensures that its coat is not only water repellent, but can also withstand extreme temperatures. The Nova Scotia Retrievers’ body is muscular and sturdy with a deep chest and a short back. Its feet are round and webbed with arched toes. When active, this breed gives the impression of power as its back legs supply the drive and its front legs reach well out in front. Colour: Various shades of red and orange, with lighter feathering and sometimes features of white. Training: This highly intelligent dog is agile and active. Training the breed is not difficult as this breed is very attentive and is obedient. Its high energy makes it fun-loving and a fast learner. The Toller has won many dog trials such as fly ball and agility, alongside showing a talent for tracking and obedience. Exercise: This dog requires a minimum of 2 hours exercise a day. They enjoy games to do with swimming and retrieving as this is their strong point. As long as this breed is sufficiently exercised they will remain happy. As the Toller is lively, they do best with a securely fenced yard. Care: The Toller requires simple grooming, such as regular brushing of their double coat and dry shampooing. Bathing regularly is not recommended as it will strip the coat of its natural oils which are needed if the coat is to remain water resistant. Puppies require a nutritious diet in order to ensure the proper formation of the bones and joints. Health: Although generally healthy, some Tollers can develop eye and thyroid problems. Symptoms of thyroid problems include weight gain, skin and hair problems. As 1 in 6 Tollers have been known to suffer from thyroid problems, it is best to know the signs and practice regular check-ups.  Hip Dysplasia is another common health issue amongst this breed. The Toller’s live expectancy ranges from 9-15 years.

Old English Sheepdog,not available,"Despite the name ‘Old English’, records do not confirm that the breed is either ‘Old’ or all ‘English’. The breed emerged in England in the mid 1700’s and it seems likely, given its characteristics, that it is linked to ancient herders, including the Bergamasco, the Bearded Collie, the Briard and the Armant. The nickname ‘Bobtail’ is significant in this breeds history. In England in the 18th century, tax exemption was granted to drover dogs, which helped drive the herds to market. To mark these dogs, their tails were docked. OES’s were excellent at this job because of their eagerness and weather resistant coats. However no one in these days groomed the dogs and they were sheared annually along with the sheep. The farmers’ wives spun the dog shearings’ as well as the sheeps’ wool into warm clothing. In 1873, the breed made its first appearance in a British Show and demand was soon to follow in America, Canada and other countries around the world. The breed was exported to the United States in the 1880s, and by the turn of the 20th century, five of the ten wealthiest American families bred and showed the Old English Sheepdog.","Still a herder at heart, the Old English Sheepdog has been known the regularly bump or sometimes push members of their family trying to herd them. Although this trait can be trained out of the breed, it is seen as harmless and adds to the dogs’ quirky personality. The OES is even-tempered and faithful; you will rarely encounter this dog becoming aggressive or nervous. Be careful that this breeds’ laid back persona doesn’t lead to him becoming a couch potato!","The OES is perfect for home life due to his sweet and protective personality. He can be an excellent watchdog, but is not very scary! Like a giant teddy, this breed is fantastic with children and enjoys playing with them, watching over them and giving excellent hugs. Very sociable by nature, the OES gets on with pretty much everyone. They are very good with other animals, and join in activities with great enthusiasm. This dog does wonderfully in a country setting, but is adaptable to other ways of life also.","The Old English Sheepdog has a rather long double coat. Outer coat should be coarse and harsh, sometimes wiry, while the undercoat should be soft, downy and wavy. Coat should be fluffy, yet not too fluffy, giving the dog the appearance of being overweight. This breed has large, square, compact frames covered in shaggy coats. They have large, somewhat square heads covered in fur, flat ears and large black noses. Their intelligent eyes can be brown, blue or one of each. Their eyes appear to be totally covered by fur, but their vision is never impaired. They have somewhat long necks, short bodies and big boned legs. The feet should be small, round and tight. Their tails are usually docked, and their coarse coats are abundant without being too profuse. They usually come in blue, grey, blue grey or blue merle, with or without white patches.

A variety of training methods is recommended as this breed tends to do things the way he sees fit. A range of training techniques will keep him interested and alert. This is a breed that needs firm handling during training to overcome their strong wills. However, they do want to please their handler. Early training is imperative to control the breeds’ boisterous behaviour. The OES does best with a medium sized yard, however if given regular opportunities to exercise, no yard would be fine. This breed loves a long brisk walk or a nice run as they were originally bred for working. Due to their working nature, the OES need to keep busy and active to maintain a healthy state of mind. Take them on long daily walks and schedule some time for them to frolic in wide open spaces. 2 hours a day is sufficient exercise time for the OES; this breed will need a dedicated owner to keep them fit and healthy.","The OES coat must be brushed down to the undercoat in order to prevent tangles or matting. Brushing and coming regularly will keep the coat soft and tangle free. The OES is a heavy shedder during warmer seasons which makes clipping this breed ideal if not being used for show. Grooming needs to be started from a very young age. When puppies shed their adolescent coats, it is imperative that you spend the necessary time to ensure the old coat does not become matted with the new one. Ear checks to remove excess dirt and hair will prevent infections. Claws must be trimmed, as should excessive hair between the pads on their feet.

Otterhound,not available,"Though so-called “otter dogs” have been romping around riverbanks in England and France since the 13th century, the modern Otterhound did not take form until the 18th century. Traditionally used to keep otters from depleting local fish stocks, Otterhounds are now quite rare with only 15 new registrations in the UK during 2011.","Very much a ‘love the one you’re with’ breed, the Otterhound is extremely friendly. Due to them being so friendly to everyone, they are not recommended as a guard dog or watch dog. As the Otterhound was never intended to be a family pet, they are understated and undemanding. This means they can also be fairly unresponsive and training them takes patience. They are a sturdy and loyal house pet, and are very much full of life, enjoying the company of children and other animals, especially cats.","Amazingly cuddly and sweet, the Otterhound is a docile breed that appeals to all members of the family. They are extremely intelligent and fearless, enjoying long swims even if the water is cold. Sometimes their natural hunting instincts can will them into chasing smaller animals so care should always be taken. With a history as one of the best scent-dogs, Otterhounds noses are extremely valuable in their everyday lives. They like to roam and explore, and if they catch a scent that interests them they can be difficult to distract. Although they will alert owners to an extent, they do not bark excessively, though when they do, they have a distinct deep bass voice which can be heard from quite a distance. They can do well as a quiet companion, but be careful not to let the Otterhound become a couch potato as if given the chance, they will get into lazy habits. Beware as this loveable chum also has a tendency to snore!","The Otterhound has a long double coat. The outer coat of this breed should be dense, coarse, rough and crisp giving a shaggy appearance, while the undercoat should be soft and woolly. This coat is weather proof and durable. Its head is large, narrow, square-muzzled and covered in hair. It has dark, deeply set eyes, long, hanging ears and a dark nose. Its sabre-like tail is usually carried high and its feet are webbed—ideal for swimming and stomping though streams. The skull is deep rather than wide and nicely domed. The forehead has no trace, scowl or bulge. The muzzle is deep with wide nose and nostril and plenty of flew. The colour of the eye can vary according to coat colour. Ears are set on a level with the eye and have the forward edges rolling inward. An Otterhound’s limbs should be straight and sound his body strong with a deep chest. This is a dog that is built primarily for working in the water but also galloping on land. The hindquarters should be strong and well-muscled. Tail is set high and carried up but never curled over the back. Overall, the Otterhound has a rugged but noble look.",Can come in any colour but mostly found in black and tan patterns.,"As the Otterhound was not intended to be a pet, training them can be quite a task. It will take a combination of variety, consistency, and patience with the right balance of firmness. They do not respond well to harsh methods and will quit altogether if they feel the training is too much. It takes patience to train an Otterhound as they are very independent, intelligent and can be slow to mature. Once the right method is found, training the Otterhound can be easy. Early and frequent socialization alongside persistency and a loving hand will get them on the right track. Be careful leaving this dog around low fencing, as they can be known to jump up to 5 feet high! EXERCISE: Being a large dog, it is required that the Otterhounds have a large garden to roam in. They are happiest when they have easy access to the outdoors and this means that apartment living may not be suitable. They will require around 60-80 minutes of exercise a day, broken up across the day if possible. The Otterhound will enjoy any kind of exercise from hiking to running to swimming and is a great pet to take camping as this breed loves to hunt and explore. Keeping the dog on a lead in open areas is important as their sense of smell will persuade them to follow any interesting scents.","Weekly brushing will be sufficient, however twice a week is best to keep this coat free of matting. If being used for show, the Otterhound should not have his coat clipped, as this dog should have a natural appearing coat. Beard must be washed frequently to prevent caking and debris. Otterhounds are not difficult to keep. Their coat might pick up twigs but these are easily removed. Mud can be easily washed out, beware before letting this breed in the house with muddy paws as they can leave very large footprints! Otterhounds are generally not fussy eaters and should be fed twice a day with dry or tinned food.","HEALTH: Common health issues include hip & elbow dysplasia,   epilepsy, bleeding disorders and bloat due to their deep chest. To prevent   bloat, feed the Otterhound smaller meals throughout the day instead of one   big meal. Otterhounds can suffer from arthritis and poor hip and elbow score.   The possibility of this can be reduced by making sure when they are young,   and their bones are vulnerable, that they do not jump down from high surfaces   and restrict exercise until the age of 1. Due to their ear shape, they can be   susceptible to ear infections so regular ear checks are important.

Female 80lbs Height Male 27” Female 24” Popularity: Though still used as a scent hound, the Otterhound is extremely vulnerable and there are believed to be only 1000 left worldwide. Otterhounds were featured in works of art by Vernon Stokes and John Sergeant Noble. Nobles’ works of art were featured at the Royal academy in the late 1890s. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>
    Sometimes known as ‘Woollies’ amongst hunters due to their double coat. Breed History: Though so-called “otter dogs” have been romping around riverbanks in England and France since the 13th century, the modern Otterhound did not take form until the 18th century. Traditionally used to keep otters from depleting local fish stocks, Otterhounds are now quite rare with only 15 new registrations in the UK during 2011. Character: Very much a ‘love the one you’re with’ breed, the Otterhound is extremely friendly. Due to them being so friendly to everyone, they are not recommended as a guard dog or watch dog. As the Otterhound was never intended to be a family pet, they are understated and undemanding. This means they can also be fairly unresponsive and training them takes patience. They are a sturdy and loyal house pet, and are very much full of life, enjoying the company of children and other animals, especially cats. Temperament: Amazingly cuddly and sweet, the Otterhound is a docile breed that appeals to all members of the family. They are extremely intelligent and fearless, enjoying long swims even if the water is cold. Sometimes their natural hunting instincts can will them into chasing smaller animals so care should always be taken. With a history as one of the best scent-dogs, Otterhounds noses are extremely valuable in their everyday lives. They like to roam and explore, and if they catch a scent that interests them they can be difficult to distract. Although they will alert owners to an extent, they do not bark excessively, though when they do, they have a distinct deep bass voice which can be heard from quite a distance. They can do well as a quiet companion, but be careful not to let the Otterhound become a couch potato as if given the chance, they will get into lazy habits. Beware as this loveable chum also has a tendency to snore! Conformation: The Otterhound has a long double coat. The outer coat of this breed should be dense, coarse, rough and crisp giving a shaggy appearance, while the undercoat should be soft and woolly. This coat is weather proof and durable. Its head is large, narrow, square-muzzled and covered in hair. It has dark, deeply set eyes, long, hanging ears and a dark nose. Its sabre-like tail is usually carried high and its feet are webbed—ideal for swimming and stomping though streams. The skull is deep rather than wide and nicely domed. The forehead has no trace, scowl or bulge. The muzzle is deep with wide nose and nostril and plenty of flew. The colour of the eye can vary according to coat colour. Ears are set on a level with the eye and have the forward edges rolling inward. An Otterhound’s limbs should be straight and sound his body strong with a deep chest. This is a dog that is built primarily for working in the water but also galloping on land. The hindquarters should be strong and well-muscled. Tail is set high and carried up but never curled over the back. Overall, the Otterhound has a rugged but noble look. Colour: Can come in any colour but mostly found in black and tan patterns. Training: As the Otterhound was not intended to be a pet, training them can be quite a task. It will take a combination of variety, consistency, and patience with the right balance of firmness. They do not respond well to harsh methods and will quit altogether if they feel the training is too much. It takes patience to train an Otterhound as they are very independent, intelligent and can be slow to mature. Once the right method is found, training the Otterhound can be easy. Early and frequent socialization alongside persistency and a loving hand will get them on the right track. Be careful leaving this dog around low fencing, as they can be known to jump up to 5 feet high! EXERCISE: Being a large dog, it is required that the Otterhounds have a large garden to roam in. They are happiest when they have easy access to the outdoors and this means that apartment living may not be suitable. They will require around 60-80 minutes of exercise a day, broken up across the day if possible. The Otterhound will enjoy any kind of exercise from hiking to running to swimming and is a great pet to take camping as this breed loves to hunt and explore. Keeping the dog on a lead in open areas is important as their sense of smell will persuade them to follow any interesting scents. Care: Weekly brushing will be sufficient, however twice a week is best to keep this coat free of matting. If being used for show, the Otterhound should not have his coat clipped, as this dog should have a natural appearing coat. Beard must be washed frequently to prevent caking and debris. Otterhounds are not difficult to keep. Their coat might pick up twigs but these are easily removed. Mud can be easily washed out, beware before letting this breed in the house with muddy paws as they can leave very large footprints! Otterhounds are generally not fussy eaters and should be fed twice a day with dry or tinned food.

Papillon,not available,"The Papillon originated in the 16th century, a popular lap breed of nobles and aristocracy in Europe. The French translation of Papillon is Butterfly, which they resemble with the white blaze on the forehead as the body, and the fringed ears as the wings. They are quite often considered to be a dainty breed, but in reality are well balanced and lively. The ‘Butterfly Dog’ is named for the large, classically looking butterfly shaped ears, which are fringed with long, fine hair. A Papillon with dropped ears instead of erect is called a ‘Phaléne’, which is French for ‘moth’. Though considered a separate breed, both Papillons and Phalènes are judged by the same standards (and can even appear in the same litter). Seen in art and read about in literature for over 700 years, the Papillon is a toy breed of Spaniel. The breed originally only had dropped ears instead of the erect ones we know today, and were called the ‘Dwarf Spaniel’. This small dog is easily recognisable in early Renaissance paintings, including works by some of the great masters of that time. They were often painted on the laps or at the feet of the noblewomen who commissioned the portrait. The most well-known of all Papillon owners in history was Marie Antoinette who, when she was brought to face charges in court, had a small Spaniel with her. When Marie Antoinette faced her death, it is said that her small dog was saved and went on to live in Paris in a building that is still, to this day, called the Papillon House.","The Papillon enjoys meeting new people and rarely shows a shy or aggressive nature. They love people and greet everyone confidently with affection. Despite their small stature, they are a very hardy breed with a high energy that does well in agility trials. The Papillon can get defensive of their owner, and will alert their family to danger or visitors with a tendency to bark at unfamiliar sights and sounds. As part of a family, they do well with older children as small children may be too reckless for this breeds fragility. Like many other small breeds, they can develop negative behaviours if allowed to become master of the house. Sometimes called ‘small dog syndrome’, the dog assumes the alpha role in the household and exhibits behaviours such as possession guarding, picky eating, separation anxiety and nipping. This is rectified when the owner of this breed shows firm, calm and confident leadership and instigates a routine of early training and socialisation, making sure the dog develops as a well-rounded individual. They can be great with other animals and children if they are properly introduced to them and learn how to behave around them, but if not the Papillon can become untrustworthy and not a suitable family pet, which is a shame as this is the fault of the owner, not the dog.","Papillons have a great sense of humour and enjoy being the host if you have guests. They like to put on a show and enjoying paying humans as much attention as we enjoy paying them. One thing to consider is the Papillon does require attention frequently, usually every hour, in order to be happy. They do not like being ignored and it can make them annoyed and prickly.","The Papillon's coat is long and flowing, and is silky in texture. They have no undercoat. Their coat will fluff at the chest area, and is fringed at their ears. The Papillons coat is white with patches of colour, which include black and red. They may also be tri-coloured with white body, black and tan markings. The hallmark colouring covers both eyes and ears completely and a white blaze on the forehead. They are moderate shedders. The Papillon is a small, delicate and fine boned toy dog. The small head is slightly rounded between the ears and the muzzle is short and thin, tapering away to the nose. The dark, round eyes have black rims. The large ears can either be erect or dropped with rounded tips. The hair on the ears is long, and fringed, giving the characteristic butterfly look. The long tail is carried over the body, and also covered with long, fine hair. The single coat is long, straight and beautifully fine. This dog has more abundant hair on the chest, ears, back of the legs and the tail. Coat colour is white with patches of any colour including red, black, lemon, sable, brown and liver. A mask of a colour other than white usually covers parts of the head and face which enhances the ‘butterfly’ look for which the dog is named. Papillons have an elegant, poised and alert look.","White with patches of any colour including red, black, lemon, sable, brown and liver.","The Papillon is extremely obedient and has an uncanny ability at problem solving. They require intense socialization at an early age, most notably with cats. They do very well in obedience and agility, and are highly trainable in the competitive show ring. They also make excellent therapy and service dogs. They respond best to consistent, loving, gentle guidance. The Papillon also loves to learn and perform tricks. They are typically easy to housetrain. EXERCISE: The Papillon loves outdoor exercise and enjoys a daily walk. Yards must be securely fenced, as this breed will use their problem solving skills to escape if left unsupervised. The Papillon is an active indoor breed and some of their exercise needs can be fulfilled with play sessions. The Papillon needs a considerable amount of stimulation and exercise given its relatively small size, and this should not be overlooked when considering one as a pet.","The Papillon is a moderate shedder. Therefore, they need to be brushed several times a week. It is important to pay particular attention to the hair behind the ears and on the stomach as these areas are prone to matting. They should only be bathed when necessary, dry shampooing will typically suffice. It is important to keep the pads of their paws trimmed to prevent splaying.","The Papillon is prone to various health issues such as cataracts, patella luxation, and Von Willebrands disease. Along with other toy breeds, Papillons are prone to a disease called Hydrocephalus. It is often diagnosed by the puppy having an abnormally large head, during the initial months of life along with symptoms such as a soft skull plate rather than a solid bone. They are often lethargic and do not grow as well as their litter mates. The outlook for a pup with this is not usually positive. That said, as a breed, they do exhibit a soft spot in their skulls, and they are the only breed of dog to be born with an incomplete skull. As the pup grows, this will usually join and complete, but care needs to be taken during the initial months until the skull is fully formed. Many vets not familiar with the breed or inexperienced breeders can mistakenly confuse this with actual Hydrocephalus. Bone fractures are also common in this little dog, given that its bones are so fine, so the owner should be careful with them jumping down from furniture and the like. As they are so small, they can also squeeze through any tiny gap in fences and walls and, with its adventurous sense of independence intact, it can make a dash for freedom where injury can occur when not under supervision. Common health issues include kneecap and joint problems and difficulty under anaesthesia.",not available,Singles Families with Older Children City Dwellers,"Intelligent Friendly Playful Affectionate Active Cute Falling in love with me?

Patterdale Terrier,not available,"The Patterdale Terrier was initially bred in the North West of England over 100 years ago, mainly in the Lake District and Yorkshire where the weather conditions and farming is difficult.

The Patterdale displays some of the normal terrier traits such as high energy and a surprisingly loud bark. They also possess their own unique belly crawl which was initially used to stalk quarry.

Pekingese,not available,"The Pekingese is considered to be one of the oldest dog breeds, originating in China over 2000 years ago. During this time they were only permitted to be owned by members of the Chinese Imperial Palace. Due to their lion like appearance, they were considered to be a guardian spirit amongst the Chinese and also named the ‘Lion Dogs of China’. During the second opium war in 1860, the Emperor fled the Old Summer Palace leaving his elderly aunt behind. When the British and French troops entered, she committed suicide. She was found with her five Pekingese surrounding her, mourning her death. The dogs were taken by the western soldiers, and brought back to Europe. Queen Victoria was given one of the Pekes, alongside other Lords and Duchesses, boosting their exposure and popularity. There is a legend that describes the Pekingese as the offspring of a lion and a marmoset. They fell in love and went to the patron saint of animals to see if he could help them. The saint allowed the Lion to marry the Marmoset as long as the Lion sacrificed his size and strength, becoming closer to the size of the Marmoset but retaining his heart and courage. The AKC registered the Pekingese breed in 1906.","The Pekingese were originally considered royalty, and they haven’t forgotten it! They are independent and dignified, with a naughty streak. The Pekingese considers itself royalty, and expects and demands to be pampered. Despite their small stature, they make excellent watchdogs as they will give alarm to any unusual noise. Very much a one person pet, they are wary and suspicious of strangers, and typically do not get on with other pets. They can be jealous and try to dominate over their master which is why a firm hand is needed. Pekes are extremely loyal and devoted; they can be sensitive, loving and extremely affectionate. They are good pets for all the family and do well with older children.","Although haughty with an air of arrogance, the Pekingese is a sensitive soul which craves your attention.  They also have a tendency to become jealous and will compete for your attention. Without your attention be prepared for a peeved growl! Tact is often required when owning a Pekingese. They sometimes get the idea they are bigger than they actually are and will try and show a dominance over bigger dogs by picking on them, and dominance over you by refusing food, games or affection. Without spoiling them, figure out what they really want and they will snap out of it. As you become closer to your Peke you will get to know their little strops and just how to entice them out of them!  In no means are they aggressive, and will not pick a fight easily, but are just not to be bossed around as they can more than stand their ground. Not the most active of dogs, Pekes enjoy exercise but won’t hassle you for a walk every evening. They are also accustomed to a snuggle on the sofa and are ideal for people who live in apartments or without yards.","Beautiful and regal, the Pekingese is a small compact long coated dog with a characteristically short, flat face and an abundantly feathered tail curled over the back. The Pekingese is a double coat breed. The coat should be long and straight with an ample mane extending over the shoulders and round the neck. The topcoat should be coarse, extravagant, long and flowing with profuse feathering. The undercoat is soft and plush in texture. The Pekingese should have a large head, being wider than deep. The skull should be broad and flat with good width between the eyes and a wide muzzle. The nose, which is well set between the eyes, should be short and broad with large open nostrils. The large sized eyes should be round and dark in colour. The ears are heart shaped, set level with the skull and carried close to the head. The neck is very short and thick. The chest is short and broad. The front legs should be short, thick and slightly bowed; the back legs should not be as heavily boned as the front legs. The feet should be large and flat; the front feed should turn out slightly. The long feathered tail should be high set and carried over the back. The feathering is also abundant on the ears, back of the legs and toes. Overall, Pekingese have a mini lion appearance with a dignified air.",All colours and patterns are allowable. Pekes come in a wide variety of colours and markings.,"Like other canine companions, the Pekingese does not respond well to harsh, loud or overly bossy masters. They require small, varied sessions of basic obedience and socialization. They can be difficult to train as they can be stubborn, but patience is key. Pekes have loads to say, and will bark and bark. This makes them a good watch dog as they will alert you to intruders. With training and socialization you can reduce the barking a little, but be warned this will never cease completely. Exercise: Being a small dog, the Pekingese can have the majority of their exercise needs met indoors with play sessions. They enjoy a few short walks a day for 20-40 minutes per day. This isn’t much in comparison to other larger breeds who require a lot more. They can also occupy themselves when left in the garden or in the company of toys.","The Pekingese requires daily brushing due to their elegant coats. This prevents tangles, knots and mats. They are average shedders. They will also need to be dry shampooed regularly. Their faces and eyes need to be cleaned daily and delicately with a damp soft cloth. Special care must be given not to overfeed as they can gain weight easily.","The Pekingese has been known to suffer mainly from breathing and sight issues due to their flat faces. They can also suffer back problems due to their long back and older dogs may not be able to go up and down stairs unaided.  To ease the breathing problems, Pekes should not be left outside as they cannot regulate their body heat in overly hot or cold weather. The risk of eye infections can be reduced by cleaning the dogs face with a damp flannel every day.

Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen,Small: Weight Male 31 – 40 lb (14 – 18 kg) Female 31 – 40 lb (14 – 18 kg) Height Male 13 – 15” (34 – 38 cm) Female 13 – 15” (34 – 38 cm),"Originating in 16th century France, the Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen (PBGV) was bred to hunt small game by scent. Capable of hunting in any type of weather as well as over any type of terrain, it is the smallest of the four hounds that come from the Vendee region of Western France. Bred directly from the white Southern Hound and rough-coated dogs from Italy, there are two varieties of the Basset Griffon Vendeen. While they originally occurred in the same litters, the breeding of these two varieties has been separated into two distinct breeds since the 1970’s- the Grand and the Petit. Cross breeding is now forbidden, yet puppies of both sizes are sometimes born in a single litter. As it’s name implies, the PBGV is smaller in size than the Grand Basset Griffon Vendeen. Better suited to city living than larger Basset Griffon breeds, the PBGV is bound to become a lively member of the family.","Your Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen makes for an extremely vivacious companion. Compact and hardy, they are constantly seeking adventure and will give you a real run for your money (it goes without mentioning that it’s best to keep an eye on this explorer). You’re never really alone when a PBGV is in the house. They love attention and affection, and will quickly tire of being left alone. That being said, your little friend does still appreciate having their own space, especially if a few chewy toys are thrown into the mix. Unfortunately if they get bored they will become destructive (say goodbye to your garden) so it is integral to ensure that your PBGV is walked daily and given the attention that they need. A very active breed, they thrive when outside as well as in family play sessions. Extremely friendly by nature, they will become a little ray of sunshine in the house. While they are great with children and other dogs, due to their hunting genes their social skills do not extend to non-canine pets. Similarly, it is best to keep your PBGV on a tight leash when walking unless you want to lose them to the hunt. While they are relatively easy to train they do tend to have a mind of their own and can be very cheeky when not kept in check.","The Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen is an extremely happy and vivacious dog. A real pleasure to be around, they thrive on human attention and are always getting up to mischief. Whilst intelligent and charming they can also prove to be very wilful. A PBGV that is provided with the proper amount of mental and physical exercise, along with strong leadership, will be less likely to get into trouble. Training can be hard work and it is very important to assert your dominance at an early stage. Much of this breed’s behaviour reflects their heritage as hunting hound and resultantly they love to dig and will chase anything in sight. Lively, active and robust they are always on the alert. Great with other dogs, adults and children alike, the PBGV’s friendly nature makes them a great choice for young families and active seniors alike. In fact, they are sure to charm anyone they come into contact with.","The Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen is a small, low to the ground dog that is roughly twice as long as it is tall. They should have narrow, rounded heads with dark, oval-shaped eyes. They are recognisable due to their distinctive bushy eyebrows, moustaches and beards as well as their long feathered ears. They should have a large black nose with wide nostrils and teeth that meet in a scissor or level bite. The tail is medium in length, set high and carried with jaunty pride. The long outer coat should be harsh to the touch, with a thick short undercoat. The outer coat is naturally un-kept in appearance, and provides protection when hunting in thick brush while the dense under coat and provides warmth.","The GBGV can be white with lemon, orange, black, tricolour or grizzle","With their intelligence and desire to please, the Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen is relatively easy to train. However, it is integral that they learn who is dominant from an early age and socialisation and basic obedience are recommended. This is a dog that needs firm leadership and training should be done with fairness, patience, repetition, consistency and reward.","The Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen requires weekly brushing to remove loose and dead hair, while bathing should be done when necessary. Properly groomed this breed sheds little to no hair. Nails need to be clipped regularly and ears and teeth should be checked and cleaned on a consistent basis. Don’t forget to peek under those long ears occasionally for signs of infection","The lifespan of a healthy Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen is between 12-14 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. However, if your PBGV does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. The PBGV is generally considered to be a hardy, healthy dog, relatively free from hereditary and congenital problems. Epilepsy has been known to occur in the breed, although selective breeding has reduced the occurrence. Hip and elbow dysplasia can also occur, and it is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. Because dysplastic dogs often produce dysplastic puppies, buyers should ask if both the sire and the dam of the puppy in which they are interested have been rated clear of hip dysplasia. Do not take yes for an answer without seeing a certificate, and ask for a copy to take to your veterinarian. Other problems can include patella luxation, where the kneecap slips in and out of place. Despite these concerns, if you are careful who you buy from, your Petit Basset Griffon Vendeen should give you many years of good health, fun and loving companionship.","('Hound',)",Families Active seniors City-dwellers People who like long walks,Fun Affable Energetic Bold
Pharaoh Hound,Medium: Weight Male 51 – 55 lb (23- 25 kg) Female 44 – 51 lb (20 – 23 kg) Height Male 22 – 25” (56 – 62 cm) Female 21 – 24” (53 – 61 cm),"The Pharaoh Hound is the oldest breed of domesticated dog. Evidence of dogs that look similar to the Pharaoh Hound has been found in Egypt’s Nile Valley, dating back from approximately 4000 BC. Is thought that during Ancient Egyptian times, sight hounds were commonly traded by the Phoenicians and were left to breed naturally on isolated islands for hundreds of years. During 1000 BC, the island of Malta was populated by the Phoenicians, who brought along their sight hounds. It is from here that today’s Pharaoh Hound is thought to originate from. The Pharaoh Hound has been bred for thousands of years to create a dog which is skilled at hunting, as well as being a companion animal. The breed is particularly adept at hunting small game and for this reason it is sometimes called the ‘rabbit dog’. Despite being an ancient breed, the Pharaoh Hound was not introduced to Britain until the 1930s, and they did not receive much attention or recognition until thirty years later, in the sixties.","Your Pharaoh Hound strikes the perfect balance between a companion animal and a sporting dog. He is independent, loves to run and thrives on a good amount of physical stimulation, but is also quiet, patient and content. His desire to hunt means that he has a huge amount of stamina. You’re more likely to get tired on a walk with your Pharaoh Hound before he shows any signs of slowing down. A brilliant breed with children, your Pharaoh Hound is a wonderful pet for families as he is gentle and incredibly loyal. Your Pharaoh Hound can be a bit wary of strangers, but will soon warm up to them once he realises they can be trusted. It’s important to socialise your Pharaoh Hound from an early age so that he knows not to be too timid when meeting new people or other dogs.","Your Pharaoh Hound is very much a companion animal and is not well suited to life as a kennel dog or a pet that is left alone all day. All he wants is to be close to you; he loves to be near his owner at every opportunity. While he loves to run and hunt, your Pharaoh Hound is a loyal and obedient dog who, despite his inbred instinct to hunt and chase, has a good recall and will return to you when you ask him to. Their intelligence and willingness to please make Pharaoh Hounds highly trainable, and they excel in agility and competitive obedience. However, he also has a very independent nature and can run rings around his owner if they aren’t on the ball. They always seem to be one step ahead of their owners, so they need a patient owner who can handle their wilful, sometimes mischievous streak.","The Pharaoh Hound is an incredibly athletic and beautiful looking breed. The medium sized dogs’ most striking feature is their large, erect ears which are broad and set medium high. The eyes should be oval shaped with an amber hue. A long, lean head, which has a wedge shape when seen from above, features strong, powerful jaws which meet in a scissor bite. There should be a long, svelte neck with a slight arch, a deep chest with well-sprung ribs and a thin, high tail which curves when the dog is active.

The coat is short and glossy and can be anything between very fine to slightly coarse.","The Pharaoh Hound can vary in colour from tan to a rich tan and they may have a small amount of white on the tip of the tail, toes, face or chest.","The Pharaoh Hound needs an owner that will be fair, firm and consistent with their training. They are very sensitive to the tone of your voice, so will become stressed and upset if harsh or severe training methods are used.

Polish Lowland Sheepdog,Medium: Weight Male 40 – 50 lb (18 – 23 kg) Female 30 – 40 lb (14 – 18 kg) Height Male 18 – 20” (46 – 51 cm) Female 17 – 19” (43 – 48 cm),"In its native country of Poland, the Polish Lowland sheepdog is commonly referred to as the Polish Owczarek Nizinny, or Pon. Originating from the 13th Century, it is thought that the Polish Lowland Sheepdog is a cross of the Puli and a mixture of herding dogs. They are extremely skilled herding dogs and were commonly used to guard and herd sheep in Eastern Europe. In 1514, a Polish merchant by the name of Kazimierz Grabski traded a shipment of grain for a flock of sheep in Scotland. Grabski brought six Polish Lowland Sheepdogs to Scotland with him, to herd the sheep and keep watch over them. A Scottish shepherd saw the dogs and was incredibly impressed by their herding abilities. He was so taken with the dogs that he traded a ram and two ewes for three of the Pons – a dog and two females. These dogs went on to breed with the local dogs in Scotland to produce herding breeds, including the Bearded Collie. Like many breeds, the Polish Lowland Sheepdog came close to extinction during World War II, with only two males and one female surviving. However, the hard work of Dr Dabuta Hryniewicz and her dog Smok, saved the breed. Smok is the ancestor of all the Pons in the modern day, siring the first ten litters of Polish Lowland Sheepdogs in the 1950s. Smok also set the breed standard for the Polish Lowland Sheepdog in 1959, and is considered the perfect example of the breed thanks to his endurance, strong build and charming character.","The Polish Lowland Sheepdog was bred to be a working dog and that’s what it does best. The breed was never intended to be a companion dog and will become bored and destructive if he doesn’t have plenty to keep him occupied. Your Polish Lowland Sheepdog needs a lot of exercise and mental stimulation to keep him content and happy. If he doesn’t get enough physical exercise he will become bored and destructive as a way of relieving stress and boredom. Your Polish Lowland Sheepdog is a confident and self-assured breed. He has an excellent memory, which means that he can be well trained with the right owner and training methods.","Your Polish Sheepdog is a dominant dog who can be incredibly stubborn and wilful. He knows what he wants and often won’t be told otherwise! For this reason, he’ll do best with an experienced dog handler who can show an air of authority and dominance over the breed. They have a mind of their own and need strong guidance, so meek or timid owners will struggle to keep the Polish Lowland Sheepdog’s attitude in check. Your Pon doesn’t do well with other pets, including small animals and cats, and has a tendency to be aggressive towards other dogs of the same gender. Your Polish Lowland Sheepdog’s herding nature means that he was bred not just to herd flocks of sheep, but also to protect them from predators. This instinct to protect is still a strong trait of the Polish Lowland Sheepdog and he will watch over you, your family and your household without a moment’s hesitation. This protective streak means that they are usually suspicious of strangers and will be very aloof with visitors that to your home.","A medium sized dog, the Poland Lowland Sheepdog has a muscular frame which gives the breed strength and power. The body has a square shape, though it actually looks more rectangular due to a heavy amount of fur on the chest and rear. In the United States, where docking is still practiced, the tail is either short or docked, however in Europe the tail comes in varying lengths as docking is banned. The head is round with a large black nose, straight muzzle and brown, oval eyes. The Polish Lowland Sheepdog’s coat is thick with a soft, dense undercoat and a rough topcoat which can be straight or wavy, but never curly. The shaggy coat covers the entire body, as well as the head and eyes, which is frequently covers.","The Polish Lowland Sheepdog’s coat usually comes in white or grey with black markings, which is the preferred colouring. However, the breed can be found a large variety of different shaded coats.","Due to the fiercely independent nature and strong mind of your Polish Lowland Sheepdog it is vital that you socialise him and begin training him from a very early age. Their intelligent nature means that they are problem solvers and they are also highly intelligent, which means they can be manipulative and try to enforce dominance over their owners. It is therefore important that their owners must be firm, confident and consistent during training.",Your Polish Lowland Sheepdog is an average shedder who needs a fair amount of grooming. Their thick coat requires a daily brush in order to prevent mattes and knots from forming and to remove loose and dense hair from the undercoat. Bathing should take place as and when necessary.,"With an average life span of 10 to 12 years, Polish Lowland Sheepdogs are hardy breeds with very few major health issues.

Pomeranian,Small: Weight Male 3 – 7 lb (1.5 – 3 kg) Female 3 – 7 lb (1.5 – 3 kg) Height Male 8 – 11” (20 – 28 cm) Female 8 – 11” (20 – 28 cm),"The Pomeranian originated from larger Spitz dogs from Russia and Siberia. Though Spitz type breeds are usually much larger than the toy sized Pom, the Pomeranian was originally around twice as large as they are today. Paintings from the 18th and 19th Centuries show depict Pomeranians as a larger breed than they are now. They were originally used as large herding dogs, particularly in places like Lapland. When Queen Victoria came to the throne in England, Pomeranians were already a fairly popular breed. However, after the queen herself set up a kennel for her favourite dogs and included a red sable Pomeranian called ‘Windsor’s Marco’, the breed became even more popular. Windsor’s Marco was a particularly small Pomeranian and as a result breeders began developing much smaller Pomeranians, which led to the breed’s toy size that we know and love today and created a global demand for the Pom. During the late 19th century, Pomeranians were brought into the United States of America and in 1911 the first American Pomeranian Club show was held. The Pomeranian has been loved in the U.S ever since.","Your Pomeranian might well be small, fluffy and cute but he has a big personality. Pomeranians are confident, intelligent and active. They are incredibly curious and inquisitive dogs that have a protective nature which makes them good watchdogs – if they sense any trouble or danger they will let off a stream of barks until you pay attention. Your Pomeranian’s protectiveness is due in part to his deep loyalty to his owners and family. He is completely devoted to his owner and loves to be near them; he is affectionate and a wonderful companion yet not a clingy dog as they still enjoy their independence and are happy to spend a bit of time on their own. You can expect your Pomeranian to get on well with all members of your family and other pets, providing they are properly socialised from an early age. However, it is important to teach children that although your Pom is cute and cuddly, he needs space and won’t appreciate being mollycoddled, which can lead to snappy behaviour. Your Pomeranian has no concept of his small size and is totally fearless when it comes to acting aggressively towards much larger dogs, for this reason you should keep him on a leash during walks and outdoors adventures.","Your Pomeranian is an intelligent dog that is eager to please, which means that with the right owner and good training methods he can become a polite, friendly and wonderfully affectionate pet. Their docile and affectionate temperament makes him a fantastic family dog. However, it is very important that you do not baby your Pomeranian as this will lead to Small Dog Syndrome. Allowing your Pomeranian to show dominance over you, simply because he is so small, means the he will become stubborn, demanding, picky and may show unwanted behaviours such as separation anxiety or food guarding. They must see their owners as the pack leaders, so firm but fair training is absolutely necessary. Your Pomeranian also loves to bark and bark, so you must teach him from an early age not to do this excessively.","The Pomeranian is a small, toy dog with a compact frame. The head is wedge shaped and in proportion to the body, while the muzzle is straight and fine. The small, erect, pointed ears and dark, deeply set, almond shaped eyes create a fox-like appearance. The tail should be feathered and curl over the back. The Pomeranian’s coat is a double coat with a soft, thick undercoat and long, straight outer coat which has a coarser texture and a puffy look.","The Pomeranian’s coat comes in nearly any colour. However, the most common colours are red, orange, cream, brown or black. White markings may also be prevalent.","Your Pomeranian is quick to learn, however he’ll need firm commands and consistent training in order to get past his stubborn character. They can be difficult to housebreak, but with a bit of patience and plenty of praise he will get there eventually! It is important to train your Pomeranian from an early age not to bark excessively or he will do so incessantly throughout his life. Your Pomeranian responds well to reward based training and positive reinforcement, rather than harsh or sever training methods.","Your Pomeranian is a heavy shedder and therefore needs a daily brush in order to reduce shedding and prevent matting and a build-up of dead hair in the undercoat. During brushing, lift and part the top coat in order to reach the undercoat as well. In addition to caring for the Pomeranian’s coat, it is important to also look after their teeth which are prone to tartar. Dry food will help keep the teeth healthy as will regular cleaning.","The Pomeranian is generally a healthy breed, however they can be prone to a few health issues. Black Skin Disease can be a problem for Pomeranians and is a form of Alopecia which shows as a darkening of the skin. This disease can lead on to further skin disorders and mainly affects males. Pomeranians are also prone to slipped kneecaps, which requires veterinary treatment. Other common health issues include tooth loss and eye problems.

The breed has been prevalent in Europe for many centuries, with paintings from as far back as the 1400s depicting the poodle. The standard poodle was the first variety of poodle, with the miniature and toy poodles bred later. The name poodle most likely originates from the German word ‘pudel’ which means ‘to splash in water’. It has been suggested that German troops took poodles to France during the 1400s, and they became a very popular dog in France from then on. This may explain why some people refer to the poodle as the French Poodle. The Poodle was bred to be a hunting dog and retriever of ducks, which is why the breed enjoys swimming so much. As well as being excellent at hunting waterfowl, the Poodle was prized for its intelligence and well-mannered, friendly nature. The poodle’s ability to pick up new tricks meant that they soon became used as circus dogs and, later, were a common sight in the show ring","Your Poodle is an incredibly friendly dog who loves to please his owners and is wonderfully affectionate towards everyone. Poodles have a an extroverted side which means they love to show off and will frequently try to entertain their human family – they are a humorous breed when they want to be and love to make their owners happy. Your Poodle’s playful character means he loves to get your attention and is a very sociable dog. Poodles thrive on company and will want to be completely involved in all parts of family life. A wonderful family dog, your Poodle is fantastic with older children as he is not only fun loving but also patient and gentle. If properly socialised, your Poodle will also do well with younger children although his size makes him a better pet for those that are a bit older.","As well as being a polite and calm dog, the Poodle is also a high energy breed. He’s lively and spirited and therefore needs plenty of exercise to keep him a content and well-balanced dog. Your Poodle will thrive with plenty of daily exercise and he loves to swim; he was bred to be an excellent swimmer and as such he adores jumping into water whenever possible! The Poodle is best suited to an active and busy lifestyle and may become destructive if he isn’t given enough mental and physical stimulation. The Poodle is one of the easiest dogs to train because he is incredibly sensitive to the tone and pitch of your voice. It is therefore important not to raise your voice or speak to him harshly, or your Poodle may become upset and training will become more difficult. Although your Poodle is generally a sociable and friendly dog, he can make a good watch dog as he will usually announce visitors with a few barks.","The Poodle has an elegant and poised stature with a medium sized frame. The body should be squarely built and well proportioned, with long legs which attribute to a bouncy, trot-like walk. The head should be long with a rounded skull and long muzzle. There should be a slightly chiselled look under the eyes, which are wide, dark and oval shaped. The teeth meet in a scissor bite. The ears should be set low and hang close to the head. A strong, long neck meets muscular shoulders, while the ribs are well sprung and the chest is deep. The forelegs are straight and the hindquarters are very muscular, which gives the poodle power when hunting and swimming. The feet should be small and oval, with close toes and tough, hard pads. The Poodle’s tail should be set high. A medium to long length coat is curly and profuse and is trimmed in a variety of styles, including the pet clip which is completely short, the continental clip in which the hindquarters, half the tail and the upper legs are shaved, and the English saddle clip in which only half the tail and the upper legs are clipped.","The Poodle’s coat can come in any solid colour, but the most common shades are black, white, blue, grey, silver, brown, café-au-lait, apricot and cream. In all but the white dogs, the coat colour will begin to fade at the age of four or five years.","The Standard Poodle is famous for its intelligence and is a wonderfully easy dog to train, making them excellent at obedience work and agility competitions. Their ability to pick up new tricks once made them popular circus dogs. They are incredibly sensitive to vocal tone and pitch, which can help in training but can also be a hindrance if you speak too loudly, harshly and severely. Be sure to use calm but firm vocal commands and use reward based training to get the most from your Standard Poodle","The Standard Poodle does not shed and is therefore a good breed for people who have allergies. However, they do need a substantial amount of grooming. Poodles need to be clipped on a regular basis and, as they do not shed and dirt and odour can build up in their coats, they also need bathing frequently. Their curly coats also need a daily brush in order to stop the coat from becoming tangled. The distinctive cuts of the Poodle coat were originally created to make the dogs lighter and better suited to swimming while hunting and retrieving ducks, while protecting their joints and vital organs when it was cold. However, the continental and English saddle clips are now more commonly seen in the show ring, while most dogs used as pets are kept in a puppy or pet clip. Whichever clip you choose, you must be prepared to take your Poodle to the groomer approximately every six weeks for a clip. It is also important to keep your Poodle’s teeth and ears clean in order to avoid ear infections and gingivitis.","Though the Standard Poodle is a relatively hardy breed, there are a few health problems to look out for. All Poodles are prone to eye problems, including Progressive Retinal Atrophy, Cataracts and Glaucoma. Epilepsy is also an issue for Standard Poodles, as is hip dysplasia which is common in larger breeds of dog. Your standard poodle is also susceptible to bloat, during which the stomach can turn and become blocked, causing a build-up of gas. Bloat can be fatal, so avoid it by feeding your Poodle smaller meals more often, rather than fewer but larger meals.

This is a very old breed of dog, which has been written about since the 11th century when monks wrote about a Portuguese Water Dog swimming to rescue a sailor drowning after a ship wreck. While the exact breed origins of the Portuguese Water Dog are not known, it is thought that they descend from the same breeds which gave rise to the poodle, Puli and Kerry Blue Terrier. Unsurprisingly, this breed had a natural affinity with water and loves to swim. For this reason, the Portuguese Water Dog was commonly owned by fishermen and sailors, and the breed has also been known as ‘The Fishing Dog’. During the late 19th Century, the Portuguese Water Dog became an incredibly popular dog in Portugal, after King Carlos I fell in love with the breed and gained his own Portuguese Water Dogs.  By the 1930s a Portuguese shipping heir by the name of Vasco Bensaude started a breeding program for the Portuguese Water Dog. Sadly, the breed suffered during the Second World War and the number of Portuguese Water Dogs vastly diminished. To this day, the breed is still extremely rare.","Your Portuguese Water Dog is incredibly loyal to his family and also very alert, making him a very good watch dog as he is not only aware of his surroundings and tuned in to possible danger, but he also cares deeply for his owner and wants to protect the family and household. A good companion dog, you Portuguese Water Dog loves to be around people and wants nothing more than to be close to you, so he’s not well suited to life as a kennel dog. Be sure to integrate your Portuguese Water dog with the family and he will be one happy dog! While his drive to protect the family and home does make him a good watchdog, it also means that he can be wary of strangers and he should therefore be socialised from an early age and throughout his life. The Portuguese Water Dog can be aggressive towards other dogs, so it is important to socialise him with other dogs as well as with people.","A highly intelligent dog, your Portuguese Water Dog is friendly and confident. He is not only incredibly smart, but also has a lot of energy, so it is important to give him plenty of mental and physical stimulation through daily exercise and training. They do not do well with a sedentary lifestyle as they will become bored and may show destructive behaviour. Your Portuguese Water Dog’s favourite hobby is to swim – he loves nothing more than jumping into water, no matter how cold or dirty it might be! For this reason, Portuguese Water Dog owners need to exercise caution around frozen ponds and lakes as the breed tends to leap before it thinks when it comes to playing in water. Your Portuguese Water Dog is an excellent retriever and will thoroughly enjoy a game of fetch. However, this means they have a tendency to mouth objects, which they will do excessively if they are bored or suffering from separation anxiety.","The Portuguese Water Dog has a solid frame with a muscular body that is slightly longer than it is tall. The legs are strong and powerful with webbed feet which help the dogs swim through strong currents. The head should be large, with a round skull and boxy muzzle.

Some experts believe Pugs are shorthaired versions of Pekingese and were the pet of choice for royalty in the Shang Dynasty (1600 – 1046BC), others say Pugs are a small kind of French mastiff or Bulldog. Even the name ‘Pug’ causes debate and could originate from a pet name for marmoset monkeys or from the Latin pugnus, meaning “fist.” Despite the confusion, most authorities agree the Pug’s roots are Chinese and the breed dates back to as early as 400B.C. In the 1st Century Pugs were adored by Chinese royalty and aristocracy. Many ancient Chinese artworks include the Pug which is a testament to their popularity in the region at this time. The appearance of today’s Pug has origins in 16th Century England, when the earliest Pugs were referred to as Dutch Mastiffs, despite bearing no relation to the Mastiff breed. Historical paintings show Pugs much as we know them now, with a black mask and curly tail, however their ears were cropped. This practice involved cutting off the dogs ears close to the head for aesthetic reasons. This was outlawed in the 1800s.  The Whilloughby strain of Pugs was developed in England by the Whilloughby family. Dating from 1842 when the Whilloughby’s acquired two dogs and successfully bred them, Whilloughby Pugs were a silver-fawn colour with a dark trace along its back, from the base of the head to its tail.  After the British invasion of China in 1860, many more Pugs were introduced to Europe. Thanks to their happy go lucky nature and wonderful companionship, their popularity has been growing ever since.","Your Pug is a friendly, non-aggressive dog which loves to play, making them perfect for families. Their gentle, fun-loving nature is ideal for children who want a cuddly companion. Pugs have a stubborn streak which you need to look out for. Your Pug is not only intelligent but they know what they want and they are resolute in finding a way to get it. Pugs love to meet new people and get on well with everyone; it doesn’t matter if they’re a family or single, young or old, human or animal – the Pug wants to be friends! Just don’t expect a guard dog, your Pug may be strong for his size, but he’s a lover not a fighter. Loyal and eager to please, your Pug loves company and will follow you everywhere. Your Pug is a constant companion who is always by your side.","The Pug’s temperament is his most loved and sought after feature. Pugs are just full of love! They may have a favourite owner, but the Pug is not a one person dog. They want to make friends with everyone. This sociable breed gets on great with other animals too and lives happily with other pets. Just beware; the Pug can become jealous if they feel as though your affections are being devoted to someone else. The Pug needs plenty of cuddles, petting and play time to keep it happy, and prefers to be in the company of others than left on its own; though they are intelligent enough to find their own fun when necessary. The playful temperament of the Pug means they are great with children, as they are patient and gentle. Their strong bodies ensure they are a tough breed that can withstand the rough play of young children. Once they’ve had enough you won’t find it easy to convince a Pug to continue playing – they can be stubborn. Though the Pug is a charming host and usually greets guests with a cheerful welcome, they make good watchdogs due to a healthy bark which contradicts its size.","A well-bred Pug has a typically square shape and stout, muscular body with a broad chest. The legs are strong and straight. The Pug’s head is large with extensive wrinkles and his eyes should be a very dark colour, large, round and pronounced. The muzzle is short and blunt and the mask should be dark black. The ears are small and come in two distinct shapes, the rose and button. The Pug’s tail is tightly curled up over the hip and falls to one side; a double curl is particularly desirable. The Pug’s fine, short coat is smooth and silky.","The coat of the Pug comes in black, silver, fawn and apricot.","Pugs love to please their owners and are highly intelligent. They respond well to positive encouragement rather than punishment. Use reward based training as harsh methods, raised voices and angry words will make the Pug stressed, hurt their feelings and hinder their training.","The Pug’s short, blunt snout means it is unable to cool itself like other breeds can, through panting. This means that they can overheat, which is very dangerous and could even be fatal. Pugs are unable to tolerate extreme heat and humidity, so if you live in a hot country the Pug may not be a suitable breed for you. They are also not well suited to the cold, as they are more likely to pick up colds and viruses. An ambient temperature is best for the Pug. Their flat muzzle also means that they can be prone to snoring and wheezing, as fluid can become trapped under their palette. However this usually sorts itself out. Make sure you clean the Pug’s many facial wrinkles with a damp lint-free cloth on a regular basis, as they can be a harbour for dirt and germs. The Pug’s short coat is prone to shedding, so some grooming is needed though the Pug is generally low maintenance when it comes to taking care of its coat. If there’s one thing which Pugs love as much as their owners, it is food! They are food motivated so you have to be very careful not to over feed your Pug as they will become obese. Control their diet and provide daily exercise to maintain a healthy weight and ensure your dog has a happy, long life. Pugs live well in apartments, provided they get enough exercise. Lots of play, coupled with daily walks should do the trick!","The lifespan of a healthy Pug is 12-14 years, however they are prone to a number of health concerns. Due to their short muzzles, Pugs have a tendency to develop breathing issues. The Pug’s breathing passageways are compacted which makes breathing difficult and means they are unable to regulate their temperature by panting. Their normal temperature lies between 38 – 39°C but once it reaches 41°C they need immediate attention and require urgent help to cool down. At 42°C, their condition may become critical – the internal organs begin to break down, causing long term health issues or even death. Pugs can also fall victim to Necrotizing Meningoencephalitis (NME), also known as Pug Dog Encephalitis’, an inflammation of the brain. There is no cure for this condition and dogs usually die or are euthanised a few months after the onset of symptoms. As NME is thought to be inherited, buying from a responsible breeder who has full details of your puppy’s lineage is vital. Pugs can also be prone to infections in the ears, nose and mouth. This is usually due to skin infections beginning in the Pug’s face wrinkles, which then spread. Avoid this by keeping their wrinkles clean and dry. As Pugs are prone to obesity, provide your Pug with a healthy diet and regular exercise. Other health concerns to look out for are hip dysplasia, elongated palate, Brachycephalic syndrome, stenotic nares, patellar luxation, Legg-Perthes Disease, entropion, Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca (KCS) and Hemivertebra.

They belong to the pastoral group and have been used to guard sheep and cattle in the inhospitable climate of the mountainous regions of Southern Europe. The Pyrenean Mountain Dog is known as the Great Pyrenees in North American and should not be confused with the Pyrenean Mastiff. This breed has been used by shepherds for hundreds of years including those of the Basque people who inhabit parts of the region in and around the Pyrenees Mountains. One of the first descriptions of the breeds dates from 1407 and by 1675 the breed was a favourite of The Grand Dauphin and members of the French aristocracy. These dogs were also used to smuggle contraband over the border between France and Spain as their sure-footedness enabled them to use passes that were impossible for humans, thereby avoiding detection by custom officials. Early in the 20th century, however, the breed was scarce and Bernard Senac-Langrange and M Dretzen can both be credited for saving the breed. To this day, the breed works in France guarding their flocks of sheep and herds of cattle from bears, wolves and other stock thieves. The standards for this breed were not completely set even as late as 1874 with two major sub-types recorded: the Western and the Eastern. According to the Great Pyrenees Club of America, this breed is naturally nocturnal and aggressive with predators that may harm its flock. However, this breed can generally be trusts with small, young and helpless animals due to its natural guardian instinct.","The first Pyreneans that were kept as pets had rather assertive, warrior-like personalities but this breed is now a kind natured, patient and noble pet due to generations of selective breeding. They are courageous and affectionate, mixing well with children and wanting to be included in family activities. They can be aggressive towards other dogs of a similar size and to strangers which makes them excellent guard dogs. Due to their large size and their tendency to bark a lot they are unsuitable for urban areas. This breed is highly intelligent and can be stubborn to they require training from an early age.","In its nature the Pyrenean Mountain dog is confident, gentle and affectionate. They can be territorial and protective of their flock or family when necessary but its general demeanour is composed and patient. This is a strong willed, independent and reserved breed but they are attentive, fearless and loyal to their duties. The Pyrenean Mountain dog will patrol its perimeter and may wander if they are off the lead in unenclosed spaces. They have a tendency to bark and growl a lot unless they are trained against such behaviour. Despite this relative stubbornness, it is quite unusual for the Great Pyrenees to become aggressive or turn on its master. They also need a lot of space in which to roam.","This breed looks as majestic as the mountains that give them their name. They are massive, beautiful and have great elegance. They look strong and yet are well-balanced, unhurried, steady and smooth in movement which is driven by powerful hindquarters. The Pyrenean Mountain dog is unique in that it has double dew claws on each hind leg. They should have a strong head without coarseness and no obvious stop. A scissor bite is correct but a pincer bite will be tolerated. All pigmentation should be black. The eyes should be almond-shaped and dark amber-brown in colour, with an intelligent and contemplative expression. The ears should be fairly small and triangular with rounded tips and set on level with the eyes, lying flat against the head apart from when alert when they may be slightly raised. The neck should be fairly short, thick and muscular adjoining powerful shoulders. The chest should be broad and the back a good length, broad, muscular and straight with a top-line which curves smoothly into the tail. The forelegs should be heavily boned, straight and well-muscled, the hindquarters very strong and heavily muscled. Lack of double dewclaws on each hind leg is totally undesirable. The hind feet may turn out slightly, but the legs must be straight. The feet should be short and compact, with slightly arch. Coat: The weather-resistant, double coat consists of a long, flat, thick outer coat of coarse hair which lies over a dense, fine, woolly undercoat. The coat is more profuse about the neck and shoulders where it forms a ruff or mane, more pronounced in males, to fend off wolves that may attack their neck. Longer hair on the tail forms a plume. There is feathering along the back of the front legs and along the back of the thighs, giving a ""pantaloon"" effect. The hair on the face and ears is shorter and of finer texture.","The coat comes mainly in white and can have varying shades of grey, red (rust) or tan around the face (including a full face mask), ears and sometimes on the body and tail. As Pyreneans mature, their coats grow thicker and the longer coloured hair of the coat often fades on those dogs that were not born completely white. Sometimes a little light tan or lemon will appear later in life around the ears and face.","This breed is highly intelligent and can be stubborn so it is important to train them from an early age. They can be slow to learn new commands and slow to obey. This breed must be trained from an early age with a firm hand as they are far too strong when fully grown and can be quite independent. Pyreneans are reasonably independent and hardy but can also be stubborn and as such are not really dogs for novices. They can, especially when disturbed, bark a lot so are not suitable for built up areas.",As this breed has a history as a working dog they have developed as a well-balanced breed requiring little special attention. The coat benefits from brushing once or twice a week but can require daily brushing during shedding. This breed requires regular bathing to keep the coat in good condition.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 11 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is highly resistant to disease. They are susceptible to bone and joint related problems due to their size. They can also suffer deafness due to the white colouration of their coats. Exercise: This breed needs a moderate amount of exercise but can be lazy in warm weather. They are well suited to cold weather and snow. This breed tends to drool a lot and is a messy drinker. Exercising this breed as a puppy must be done gradually to avoid putting excess strain on their bones. Even as an adult, care must be taken to build up exercise gradually. For their size they do not need excessive amounts of exercise but do benefit from free running of the lead as well as regular walks.","('Pastoral',)",Singles Families with older children Shepherds Cold-climate dwellers,Gentle and patient Affectionate Intelligent Brave and courageous
Pyrenean sheep dog long haired,Small: Weight Male 15 – 35 lbs (7 – 16 kg) Female 15 – 32 lbs (7 – 14.5 kg) Height Male 15 – 22” (38 – 56cm) Female 15 – 20” (38 – 51cm),"The Pyrenean Sheepdog comes in two varieties – smooth faced and rough faced. The rough faced type has slightly long air around the muzzle, while the hair around the muzzle on the smooth faced is shorter and finer. Both types of Pyrenean Sheepdog are considered to be the oldest French breed. Despite the breed’s old roots, the dog was not known outside of France until the First World War. During 1916 the French Army started using the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog as a messenger dog, transferring communication between soldiers and troops. It was dangerous work for the dogs as they would be captured and killed if enemy troops saw them and wanted to intercept their messages. His fantastic speed and agility, combined with his intellect made the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog a valuable part of the war. Post-war there were very few Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdogs left. French shepherds set about reviving the breed with a dedicated breeding program. Initially, the breeding was solely to create dogs with good herding abilities but in 1921 a breed standard for the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog was created. In the same year, the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog took place in its first dog show in Toulouse. Since the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog’s efforts during the First World War the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog has gained a reputation for being courageous and heroic, making them excellent search and rescue dogs as well as watch dogs for family homes.","The Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog is a well-balanced and good mannered dog. While they are not overly excitable, hyperactive, boisterous or bossy dogs neither are they timid, neurotic, shy or nervous dogs. Instead, they are somewhere between the two and tend to be fairly calm and relaxed, with a slightly reserved attitude towards new people and environments. They need a lot of socialisation with other people and animals from a young age in order to prevent them from becoming too aloof, and they might need some encouragement in unfamiliar places. Their calm nature makes them wonderful family pets as they are great with children, enjoying playtime whilst being tolerant and patient with younger owners. However, he should be trained not to use his inherent herding abilities to try and herd young children, which feel like second nature to your Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog. Your Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog will appreciate a good deal of exercise; he loves to run and will look forward to his daily walks, especially when he can go off leash. His abundant energy means that he’s also a big eater.","The Pyrenean Sheepdog has a temperament like many other sheepdogs, despite his smaller stature. He is full of energy and loves to run, jump and explore. The ability of the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog to learn new tasks and his enthusiasm for works means that he can often be found in agility shows and competitive obedience, where he excels. Furthermore, the breed’s history in herding and watching over flocks of sheep makes the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog very protective and they will always keep a look out for trouble and make sure their families are safe, particularly where children are concerned. Your Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog will bond with all members of the family, but usually sees just one owner as their master. Your Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog will follow his master from room to room and want to be with them at all times, but won’t be overly clingy or get in the way too much. They are very sensitive to their owner’s mood. Your Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog is naturally wary of strangers, but will warm up to new people when he knows that they can be trusted.","The Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog is small with a light frame and sinewy body. The head has a triangular shape with black rimmed eyes and small ears. The tail can be either naturally bobbed or straight. The Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog has a long water resistant coat which has a soft, short dense undercoat and coarser, longer outer coat.","The Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog is usually a fawn colour with or without a black mask on the face and muzzle. However, brindle and grey are also common colours. Merle shades and black are also recognised but not as common. White markings on the head, feet and chest are sometimes noted but not preferred.","The Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog loves learning new things and enjoys working, making them an easy dog to train providing the training methods are right. Quick learners and eager to please, Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdogs will thrive with a trainer who is consistent, firm, fair and provides plenty of praise.","The Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog is fairly low maintenance, needing just an occasional brush every few weeks to prevent the coat from tangling or becoming matted. If the coat is not brushed then it will develop cords similar to that of the Puli. The Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog’s coat sheds lightly, but not excessively.","The Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog is a healthy and hardy breed with little known health problems, however epilepsy, patellar luxation and hip dysplasia have all been noted in the breed. The average life expectancy of the Long Haired Pyrenean Sheepdog is between 10 and 14 years","('Pastoral',)",Families Couples Singles Active people Country folk,Energetic Hardworking Excellent at competitive obedience and agility Devoted to his owner Loves learning tricks
Pyrenean Shepherd Dog,Medium: Weight 15 – 32 lb (7 – 15 kg) Height Male 15.5 – 21.5” (39 – 53 cm) Female 15 – 20.5”  (38 – 52 cm),"Originating in France since at least medieval times, the Pyrenean Sheepdog has a long history of herding livestock, particularly sheep, in the south of France. It worked as an active herder together with the Great Pyrenees, another mountain dog which acted as the flock’s guardian. They have been bred for their excellent endurance and stamina and possess highly attuned, natural guarding instincts. After World War I this breed gained national recognition for its valiant work as company mascots, watchdogs, couriers and search and rescue dogs. This breed is the smallest of the native French sheepdogs and is seen in two varieties: the rough faced and smooth faced. The smooth-faced Pyrenean Shepherd in its harlequin or blue merle colouration may have been one of the foundation breeds for the Australian Shepherd when sheep herders brought their sheepdogs to the American West when they flew to the United States as contract herders for the Western Range Association in the 1940s until the early 1970s. It is not yet a well-known breed outside of its native France, but its size, intelligence, and attractive coat make it appealing. After one of its breed won the World Agility Championship for mid-sized dogs in 2003, it gained more attention as an intelligent performance dog for dog sports..","This breed is hard working and highly intelligent. They form a strong bond with their master and enjoy working closely with a clear defined aim. Due to their working history they have retained a sense of independence yet are constantly aware of their situation and ready to react. They have an expressive face and well-proportioned, lean, athletic body. They are built for speed and have great endurance as well as being brave and fearless. They are loyal, devoted and watchful and can be wary and suspicious of strangers so they make excellent guardians. They do well with dogs they have been raised with or know very well.","The Pyrenean Sheepdog was designed to be a working sheepdog and is full of the same energy that other herding dogs have. This is an adaptive breed and while a natural herder, is able to do all the jobs on the field. Its intelligence makes it ideal for other work and dog sports such as flyball, competitive obedience and agility. They are good with children and have a sense of protectorship over children they have been brought up with. They will attach themselves to one member of the family and dedicate themselves to that person, following them around the house to help with daily chores. They are very receptive to people’s moods and often seem able to read their master’s mind due to their watchful nature. They are extremely trainable. Their natural wariness combined with their herding instinct can lead to shyness or aggression in even the most friendly puppy if not properly managed. It is important to engage this breed in early socialisation to counter this trait.","The Pyrenean Sheepdog comes in two varieties, rough faced and smooth faced. The body is lithe and muscular, never fat. The head is of small proportion in comparison to the dog with a rather flat skull and a somewhat short, triangular muzzle. The face is expressive and intelligent, with dark eyes, except in the case of merles or slate grey coat colour. Traditionally the dog's ears are cropped. If natural, the Pyrenean Shepherd should have semi-prick or rose ears. Naturally prick ears are not correct for the breed, and may indicate an outcross. The body is long and lean, reflecting the athleticism of the dog and the legs are well-proportioned with lean, well-angulated, well-let-down hocks typical of a sure-footed mountain breed. The tail can be docked short, a natural bob-tail, or naturally long with a crook in the end, so long as its carried below the top-line at rest and in motion. Coat: The rough faced is a double coat breed while the smooth faced is a single coat breed. In the rough faced variety the outer coat is long to demi-long, slightly wavy or flat. The texture is harsh and the undercoat is minimal and fine. The smooth faced muzzle is covered in fine, short hair that becomes somewhat longer on the head and ruff. The body hair is fine and soft. The coat of both varieties is water-proof.","The coat typically comes in shades of fawn either with or without black mask and overlay. The coat can also come in brindle and various shades of grey. Less commonly the coat can be merle of various kinds (blue merle, brindle merle, fawn merle) and black. All colours allow for some white at the head, chest and feet but solid colours are preferred","This breed is sensitive and independent but willing to please. They require early and ongoing socialisation and obedience training. They do not respond to harsh or heavy-handed methods. Training should be done with firmness, fairness, patience, and consistency.","This breed requires weekly brushing to keep the coat free of matting and tangles. The nails, ears and teeth must be checked regularly.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 14 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur.  There is no known major conditions to be aware of in this breed although as with all energetic breeds, try to limit exercise as a puppy to avoid aggravating any muscular or joint complaints. The Pyrenean Shepherd breed is prone to such health issues as Hip Dysplasia, Patella Luxation, PRA, and Epilepsy. Exercise: This hardy breed requires little special attention but they do need space and stimulation to keep them happy. They require an excessive physical and mental exercise and are not recommended for apartment or urban living. They do best in a rural setting where they have a job to do and ample room to roam, work and play. They enjoy dog sports such as agility, flyball and competitive obedience.","('Pastoral Breed Group: Herding',)",Singles Families with older children Shepherds People who like country pursuits,Adaptable Intelligent and eager to please Hardworking Loyal and devoted

Rottweiler,Large: Weight Male 85 – 135 lb (50 – 58 kg) Female 80 – 100 lb (40 – 48 kg) Height Male 24 – 27” (63 – 69 cm) Female 22– 25” (58 – 64 cm),"The Rottweiler has origins that are unknown, however it probably descended from the Italian Mastiff. It is said that the Mastiff type dog used as far back as Roman times for droving livestock is an ancestor of the modern Rottweiler. As the Romans Empire grew, these Mastiff types mated with local dogs. The Romans settled in areas in Southern Germany famed for its fertile soils and temperate climate. The Rottweiler was named after the German town of Rottweil and was a useful, multipurpose dog used for guarding, herding and due to their size and strength, pulling carts. The ancestors of the breed were the dogs used by the Roman legions to drove and guard their livestock as they crossed the Alps, which may mean that they are connected to the Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs and Entelbuchers which are also descended from Roman dogs. At this time, it was also the theory that they were used to hunt wild boar. By the Middle Ages, in Rottweil, Germany these dogs had been crossed with local sheepdogs to create the 'Rottweiler Metzgerhund', the Rottweil Butchers' Dog. Butchers used these dogs to drive and guard their livestock as it made its way on foot from town to town. In the 19th century cattle-driving became illegal in Germany and the Rottweiler suffered a decline in popularity until 1914 when they were once again brought into use for the war, which proved their physical and mental abilities. The breed entered the United States in the 1930's and was accepted into their Kennel Club in 1935, being accepted by the British Kennel Club the following year. The popularity of this dog peaked in the UK during the 1990s.","This breed is intelligent but can be rather dominant and require firm and consistent training from a young age with a calm handler. This breed is extremely sensitive so use your voice to your advantage when praising the dog. They are very loyal to their handlers and families and defend their family and property to the end. They are protective and brave but can be jealous if not given enough attention. The temperament can vary, some are independent, aloof and less friendly while other are outgoing, and gregarious.","This breed can be a fun loving dog but is powerful and can be serious at times. Early socialisation and training are extremely important for this breed as they can be very territorial and protective of their family and home. Rottweilers can be very intimidating, still retaining an undeserving reputation as a vicious and/or mean dog, however they do extremely well in a family environment. While they may be aloof and ‘standoffish’ with strangers (which is not surprising giving its guarding heritage), the Rottweiler’s general nature is one of even temper, placid, devoted and calm. The temperament of the Rottweiler can vary. Some can be very affectionate and somewhat of a clown, while others can be bullies. Their easy going intelligence should ensure that learning new commands and behaviours should not be too much of an issue for a Rottie and when a good training programme is in place making it possible for the playful side of this dog to come out in safety.","This breed is medium to large and compact. They are one of the strongest and most powerful dogs in the world for their size. Built for trotting, this breed are well-balanced and move with purpose. They are agile and capable of running and jumping with ease. The head should be of medium length with a well-developed, but not conspicuous, occiput and a well-defined stop. The teeth should be strong with a scissor bite. The eyes are almond shaped, medium sized and dark brown with small, high set ears that are wide apart and lie flat. The neck is fairly long, round, muscular and slightly arched. The back should be straight, strong but not too long with a broad and very slightly sloping croup. The shoulders should be well-laid back and the front legs straight and muscular with plenty of bone and substance. The hindlegs, broad and strongly muscled, have fairly well-bent stifles and strong, sound hocks. The feet should be strong, round and compact with well-arched toes; the hindfeet being slightly longer. The tail is short or ‘bob tailed’ and this was a breed which was traditionally docked, although with the passing of legislation in the UK prohibiting this (with permitted exceptions), the majority of Rottweilers have their natural tail. Coat: The coat is solid black, flat lying with rust or tan markings. This is a double coat breed and the undercoat is very fine and not visible through the outer coat which is coat and of medium length",The coat is black with tan markings.,"This breed is eager to learn and obedience training is a must as this breed can become destructive without enough stimulation. They require a firm and dominant handler when being trained. They are extremely intelligent and does well in dog sports but can be stubborn It is essential that this breed is socialised at an early age. Attack training is highly discouraged in case it overstimulates their already protective natures and they become uncontrollable. Rottweilers can do well with children if raised around them, but should be supervised around small children due to their sheer size and power. With the strength and power contained within the body of this breed, it is imperative that a good basic training is adhered to. Given this as a fact, Rottweiler’s are suited best to owners with previous dog owning experience who can bring out the best in them.","This breed has a short, glossy coat which is relatively easy to groom. They are an average shedder and benefit from regular brushing with a firm bristle brush to remove excess, loose hair. Bathing too often will remove the natural oils from the coat and/or skin. Dry shampooing is used by many Rottweiler owners as well as breeders so they are not to remove the essential oils in this breeds coat. The Rottweiler has a tendency to put on weight so care must be taken to make sure their weight/height ratio is monitored. This breed can become distressed if left alone for long periods of time and require an experienced owner. They have a tendency to become lazy if given the chance as they are inactive indoors. They do no require much exercise each day but do enjoy long walks.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is generally quite healthy but can be prone to hip dysplasia and to rupturing the cruciate ligament while exercising so ensure that the dog does not leap from the hind leg when catching a ball. This breed has a tendency to overeat and put on weight so regular exercise is important for this breed. Puppies must be chosen from parents who have been temperament-tested and who have been hip-screened and given a good rating. Rottweillers have become unusually susceptible to parvovirus which is somewhat concerning for breeders. Because dietary problems have occurred in the breed, make sure the breeder gives you a recommended feeding plan when purchasing your puppy. The most common causes of death in Rotties are heart disease, cancer and bloat. Exercise: This breed benefits from plenty of exercise to prevent behavioural problems. They benefit from running in the woods and open countryside and do not wander far from their owners. They love swimming and happily run alongside a bicycle. They require at least a large sized yard to play in and benefits from at least two long walks a day totalling to at least two hours of exercise per day.","('Working Rottweilers belong to the working group and are used as guard dogs, watch dogs, police dogs, companions and seen in the show-ring.',)","Experienced, confident owners People who like long walks People who like short runs Active, Outdoorsy types",Intelligent Loyal Protective Brave
Rough Collie,Large: Weight Male 45 – 75 lb (20 – 34 kg) Female 35 – 65 lb (15.8 – 29 kg) Height Male 22 – 26” (55.8 – 66 cm) Female 21 – 26” (50.8 – 61 cm),"Originating in the 1800s, it is now well known through the works of author Albert Payson Terhune, and through the Lassie novel, movies, and television shows. There is also a smooth coated variety; some breed organisations, including both the American and the Canadian Kennel Clubs, consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed. Both the Rough and Smooth Collies are descended from a variety of herding dog originating in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish variety was large, strong and aggressive, bred to herd highland sheep while the Welsh variety was small, nimble, domesticated and friendly, herding goats. These two varieties were seen at the Birmingham Market and then interbred with English sheepdogs to produce a mixture of short and long haired varieties. After the industrial revolution, dog ownership became fashionable, and these early collies were believed to have been crossed with the Borzoi (Russian Wolfhound) to get a more ""noble"" head, which is today one of the true characteristics of the Rough Collie. Continued breeding for show purposes drastically changed the appearance of the dogs; in the 1960s, it was a much taller and sturdier dog than it is today. In the UK the Rough Collie is no longer used for serious herding, having been replaced by the Border Collie. Though in the United States and a number of European countries, there has been a resurgence in the use of the Collie as a working and performance dog. The Collie Club of America is one of the oldest breed-specific clubs in existence in the United States (founded in 1886). The Collie Club in England dates from 1881.","The Rough Collie is a happy and affectionate dog. They bond well with their families and make particularly good companions for children due to their gentle disposition and readiness to play. They make good household companions and are obedient and wilful. This breed is self assured, sweet and trustworthy with an even and well-mannered temperament. They are regularly seen in homes with other animals and children as they are very passive and gentle. This breed has a tendency to nip as ankles as a pup due to its herding background but most grow out of this stage.",This breed should show no nervousness or aggression and are generally good with other children and animals but they must be well socialised to prevent shyness. They are medium to large sized dogs but can be well suited to live in small apartments because of their calm disposition. They relish human company and generally fare poorly as outdoor dogs.,"The Rough Collie has a blunter face than the smaller but otherwise very similar Shetland Sheepdog which is partly descended from the Rough Collie. The planes of the muzzle and the top of the skull should be parallel in collies, with a slight but distinct stop. (In shelties, the planes are not parallel.)  One of the characteristic features of the Rough Collie is its head. This is light in relation to the rest of the body, and resembles a blunted wedge tapering smoothly from ears to black nose, with a distinct stop and parallel head planes. The muzzle is well rounded, and never square. There is considerable variation in the colour of the head, however. The eyes are medium sized and almond shaped. The ears are supposed to be semi-prick, with the upper third folded over. Ears which do not 'tip' properly are fairly common, and many collies have their ears taped as puppies (using medical adhesive or paper tape) to encourage them to lay properly- no cutting or surgery is involved. They are similar to a Shetland Sheepdog's, but larger. Coat: The coat is double layered and the downy undercoat is covered by a long, dense, coarse outer coat with a notable ruff around the neck, feathers about the legs, a petticoat on the abdomen, and a frill on the hindquarters.","Three coat colours are recognised for Rough Collies: sable and white, where the ""sable"" ranges from pale tan to a mahogany; tricolour, which is primarily black edged in tan; blue merle, which is mottled gray. All have white coat areas, in the collar, parts of the leg, and usually the tail tip. Some may have white blazes on their faces.",The Rough Collie is very intelligent and easy to train. They are wilful and require a gentle hand to avoid shyness and refusal to co-operate with its owner. This breed is classed as one of the easiest to train breed in the world.,"The rough variety does not require as much grooming as the smooth. Short and stiff coat requires brushing weekly. Smooth variety requires daily brushing to remove any excess hair, and to keep hair from becoming matted. Monthly baths are recommended as their long coat traps dirt. The Collie is a heavy shedder given the season. Shaving collies is very bad for their skin and some do not regrow any significant amount of hair after being shaved. Spaying and neutering can alter coat texture, making it softer and more prone to matting.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. While Rough Collies are generally resilient and healthy, there are some health problems that can affect the breed such as skin complaints, eye problems and oral problems. This breed is prone to suffer Collie Eye Anomaly (CEA) and also Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA). Screening tests as a puppy can help to check for these ailments. Note: the UK Kennel Club ""Accredited Breeder Scheme"" requires eye tests and recommends the genetic test for this class of members. This breed can also suffer from Canine cyclic neutropenia a blood disorder and hip dysplasia. They can be sensitive to Ivermectin and related drugs and screening can determine if alternative medication is required. Exercise: This breed does well in a medium sized yard and can do well in an apartment if given sufficient exercise. It is not recommended that this breed is left outdoors for long periods of time in hot weather and need plenty of shade and access to fresh water. This breed competes in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Rough Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials. The breed has also been known to work as search and rescue dogs, therapy dogs and guide dogs for the blind.","('Pastoral',)",Families Singles Retirees Town or country folk People who like country pursuits,Elegant and graceful Loyal Gentle Adaptable

The breeding stock was largely imported from USSR occupied countries, especially East Germany. Bred to be a dependable and robust, the breed has since made its way out of Russia to Siberia, Nova Scotia, the United States and beyond. The Russian Black Terrier was originally bred solely by the state owned Red Star Kennel. These dogs were bred for working ability rather than appearance and resembled today's Black Russian Terrier in their build and coat type, until 1957 when puppies began being sold to civilian breeders. These breeders began to breed for looks while still retaining the dogs renowned working ability. Despite what its name suggests, the Black Russian Terrier is not a true terrier. Rather, it is believed that roughly twenty breeds were used in its development, including the Airedale, the Giant Schnauzer, the Rottweiler, the Newfoundland, the Caucasian Ovtcharka and the now extinct Moscow Water Dog. The Black Russian Terrier is still relatively rare outside the countries of the former Soviet Union but beginning to be formally recognized elsewhere. The breed was recognized by the Federation Cynologique Internationale  in 1984 and on July 1, 2004, it was recognized by the American Kennel Club in the Working Group.","Black Russian Terrier is a watchful, inquisitive and adaptable dog. It loves to be with its family and is naturally protective and loving with children. Due to its robust form and boundless energy it will make the perfect playmate. It should be noted that your companion does require a lot of affection and attention and will rarely stray far from you. A highly adaptable breed, the Black Russian Terrier is suited to apartment living despite its size, as it loves to relax indoors. This being said, it is integral that it receives sufficient exercise and needs several daily walks. It also loves the outdoors, so if you can arrange to take your dog out to a protected area, it will truly have a ball. This breed will do well in urban, suburban or country setting providing that it gets a reasonable amount of exercise. A working dog by nature, the Black Russian Terrier may become hyperactive and destructive if it does not have a chance to burn off its energy. It is happiest when doing some form of work whether it is playing games, agility, obedience or protection. As well as being intelligent and highly trainable, the Black Russian Terrier is easily adaptable to different climatic conditions and owners life-style,","The Black Russian Terrier is a very energetic breed that will delight in joining you whether you go fishing, swimming, biking or hiking. They are happiest with an owner who will keep them busy and can give them plenty of jobs to do. Originally bred as a working dog, the Black Russian Terrier has retained a strong work ethic, and will bore easily if not kept active and faced with new challenges. While they have a stable temperament, they are very lively and defensive and will spring to action if they feel that their family is being threatened. Endlessly loyal and courageous, this breed is very loving with children and other animals, provided that proper socialisation has taken place. The Black Russian Terrier thrives on human companionship and bonds deeply to its family. Their balanced temperament and high intelligence ensures that they take well to training and are affable and obedient. Confident and brave, Black Russian Terriers are wonderful companions and a loyal family member.","Black Russian Terriers have large, sturdy frames that are covered in thick black coats. They should give the impression of great strength, athleticism and courage. Black Russians have broad, powerful heads, oval-shaped eyes, bearded muzzles and big, black noses. Their small, V-shaped ears hang close to the cheek. They should have strong necks, deep chests, sturdy backs and thick tails that are usually docked and carried high. Black Russian Terrier males should be noticeably more masculine than the females. While athletic and powerful, Black Russian Terriers are slightly dishevelled in appearance and should not look as though their coats are sculpted or trimmed. Their hair is rough, ample and extremely dense, with a well-developed undercoat. The overcoat should measure between 2-6 inches (5-15 cm) in length. The rough coat covers the forelegs and hind legs, forming a mane on the neck and the withers. This distinctive coat forms a rough, bushy moustache on the upper lip and a beard on the lower lip. The beard and eyebrows on the face and the slight mane around the withers and neck are more pronounced in males.",The Black Russian Terrier is black with some grey hair,"Training is easy with the Black Russian Terrier, as it is an intelligent breed that rates higher than average in learning speed and problem solving skills. However, training must be commenced at an early age, as the dog will exploit any owner who has failed to establish clear dominance. They are very responsive to firm, consistent training, and excel at obedience competitions and other dog sports.","The Black Russian Terrier has a wiry coat that needs to be brushed several times a week and clipped by a professional several times a year.  The ears, nails and teeth will require sufficient attention.","Black Russian Terrier can live as long as 12 years with relatively few genetic health problems. However, if your Black Russian Terrier does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. While they are rare, potential health problems include progressive retinal atrophy and dwarfism. Hip and elbow dysplasia can also occur, and it is a good idea to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. This is why it is so important to screen any potential breeders as well as their breeding stock. A well-intended breeder will have all health checks on all breeding stock before making the decision to breed their dogs. If you are careful who you buy from, your Black Russian Terrier should give you many years of good health, fun and loving companionship.","('Working',)",People who like long walks Active singles Families with older children Outdoorsy types,Inquisitive Watchful Dependable Calm

Please be aware that they are, indeed, big, heavy dogs.","St Bernards are often depicted in popular culture with a bottle of brandy tied around their necks out rescuing stricken travellers in the Swiss Alps; and this comes from the fact that dogs were bred and used by the monks of the Hospice of the Great Saint Bernard Pass to actually do this. In 1707, the overworked monks realised that dogs, normally the Swiss Cattle Dog, with their superior noses, strength and weather-resistant coats were better equipped to rescue travellers than themselves. They also discovered that they had an in-bred sense of direction which was the key to survival in blizzards which caused humans to become totally lost and disorientated. Many of the dogs bred by the monks became famous, including ‘Barry’ who is said to have saved the lives of over 40 people. Barry became so famous in fact, that the breed became known as ‘Barry hounds’ in the 19th century. Somewhat sadly, by the 1830s many of the dogs were lost due to interbreeding, disease and bad winters so the monks decided to breed the dogs with Newfoundlands (bought over from Canada, a British colony) in order to save it, and this created  the more recognisable dog today. Soon a breed club was founded in Basel, and the dog has become something of a Swiss national symbol.","They become very affectionate to anyone they meet, and are great with children and other animals and this fondness with children really is very much a characteristic of the breed.

The Saluki has been found in Ancient Egyptian tombs, mummified and buried with nobility. The Saluki originates from the Middle East and has been a popular breed in the Arab world for thousands of years. The name ‘Saluki’ is thought to be derived from the town of Suluk in Libya. The Saluki has spread throughout the Middle East due to the nomadic culture of tribes in the area, meaning the dogs were taken from place to place. The breed travelled across the Gulf region to Egypt, Persia, Afghanistan, India and Sudan. The breed is the only dog considered to be clean by the Muslim religion, as it is mentioned in the Koran as a gift from Allah. By the time of the Tang Dynasty in 618 AD, the Saluki had entered China and the breed frequently appeared in paintings by the fifth Ming Emperor Zhū Zhānjī. It wasn’t until the 12th Century that the Saluki was brought to Europe, when soldiers returning from the Crusades brought the dogs back with them. They were frequently called Gazelle Hounds or Persian Greyhounds. In 1840, the first Salukis were brought into England and a modern breeding programme began in 1895 when Florence Amherst imported a pair of Salukis from Egypt after seeing them on a tour of the Nile. She struggled with breeding the dogs until the 1920s, when more Salukis were brought into the country by officers returning from war in the Middle East. Once such officer was Brigadier General Frederick Lance, who worked with Florence Amherst to raise recognition of the rare breed. In 1923 the Saluki Breed Club was formed. During World War II, many Salukis were euthanized as there were not enough food rations to feed them. Interest in the breed also weakened and breeding stopped entirely. Only a small number of Salukis survived and the breed remains rare even to this day.","You can expect to form a very special bond with your Saluki, which is different to most other breeds of dog. Your Saluki isn’t going to go into a frenzy every time you come home or walk through a door, he may not even seem that interested, but that’s just down to his dignified character. Though some people may find the Saluki to be a shy dog, many believe he is just reserved and independent. Your Saluki will love you dearly and care about you very much; he just doesn’t feel the need to get over excited whenever he sees you. It’s important to train and socialise your Saluki from an early age to prevent him from becoming too aloof with other people. The one thing which will never fail to make your Saluki happy is running. Salukis were bred to run and they need a lot of room to zoom about in. A long, daily power walk will keep your Saluki content, but if you like to jog then he’ll be even happier! Don’t expect to be able to keep up with your Saluki if he gets away from you though. Saluki’s are incredibly fast, so they should be kept on a leash.","Your Saluki is incredibly calm, with an even temperament and polite demeanour. Graceful in both motion and personality, Salukis are gentle and amiable companions with plenty of affection to bestow upon their families. Your Saluki has a curious nature which makes him very aware of his surroundings. The saluki tends to become attached to just one or two members of the family, but also has an affinity for older children and can be very protective of them. They can be a little bit nippy though, which means they are not great for families with young children that might try their patience. Your Saluki is a very sensitive dog and therefore should never be subjected to harsh training methods and will not enjoy games like tug or fetch. However, their hunting instinct means they adore chasing moving objects. Your Saluki is very quiet and will only bark if he feels it is absolutely necessary.","The Saluki has an elegant appearance. The head should be long and narrow with a broad skull. They eyes are large and dark, while the ears are long, feathered and drop down. The neck is long and sinuous, sloping towards a narrow, deep chest and broad back. The legs are long, as is the tail which is curved. The coat can come in two varieties; smooth or feathered. Both coats are short and close, but the feathered variety also has silky feathering on the ears, underside of the tail, back of the legs and the thighs.","The Saluki’s coat can come in a range of colours, including white, cream, golden, fawn, red, tan, black and tan, grizzle and tricolour.","Your Saluki is quick to learn as he is incredibly intelligent, however his independent nature means that he can become bored easily and will not respond well to a lot of repetition. Therefore, training sessions should be short, fun and varied. As your Saluki is so sensitive, harsh or severe training will not suit him. Instead, be kind and gentle, yet firm and use reward based training. His instinct to hunt has been bred into him and he should not be discouraged from doing it.","Your Saluki is a low shedder and a low maintenance breed when it comes to grooming. The occasional brush will keep his coat clean, healthy and tangle free. Feathered coats need a bit more attention on the feathered areas. The eyes and ears should be checked and cleaned on a regular basis, and their noses can be prone to sunburn.","The Saluki can be prone to a number of health conditions including eye problems, cancer, cardiac problems and hypothyroidism. Heart murmurs and cardiomyopathy are a common health issue for the breed, however cancer is the most common cause of death in Salukis. The average lifespan of the Saluki is 12 to 14 years.","('Hound',)",Single people Couples without children Families with older children Active people Joggers and hikers,Elegant and graceful Independent Quiet Loves to run Intelligent
Samoyed,not available,"The Samoyed is a true pastoral dog, used for centuries by Russian reindeer herders in the Siberian tundra. He was used for sledding, herding, guarding and keeping his owner warm. The breed is known to be at least 3,000 years old, and is one of the fourteen most ancient breeds, including the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Chow Chow. Having a somewhat wolf-like appearance, the Samoyed has been crossed with wolves to produce a wolf-dog.","Spend a few hours with a Samoyed, and you know you are in the presence of an ancient working dog. His whole instinct is to herd and pull, and keep close to you. His chief characteristic is his happy, alert expression and amazing smile, hence the nickname. His herding instinct is so strong that he will tend to herd anything in a group, and can often be seen gently rounding up children. Your Sammy will bond powerfully with you, but will be friendly towards everyone in the family and outsiders too. He will be a useful watchdog, as he has a tendency to bark, but won’t make a good guard dog, as he is far too nice to be aggressive.","Gentle, kind, loving, loyal and very cuddly, that’s your Sammy. He will follow you wherever you go, even into the shower if you let him. He hates to be by himself so bear in mind that leaving him alone, even for short periods, can be upsetting for him. Your Sammy can become bored if not given enough to do – after all he is at heart a working dog – and will dig or chew to relieve his frustration. Your Sammy will get on with everyone in the family, including small children and other dogs. Your cat will be safe too! Remember that with his heritage, he will pull on the leash unless trained to walk by your side. This tendency makes him an excellent playmate for the children, as he will happily pull them along on a sled or a cart.","Your Sammy should be a solid looking dog with a muscular frame, but graceful in action. His neck should be strong, and his chest deep. He should have a short back and a well plumed tail that usually curls over his back. His head should be broad and flat and wedge shaped to a tapering muzzle with dark, oval eyes, black lips and a black or brown nose.",White!,"Your Sammy can be trained to do almost anything you want – he will excel in obedience trials, Dog Agility contests, carting, flyball, tracking and mushing. His herding instincts mean he can be enormously useful on a farm, herding cattle, sheep or pigs, and of course can do well in either informal or formal herding trials.

Sammys feel the heat, being designed to live in a cold climate, so take care not to let him get too hot in Summer.","A healthy Samoyed should live to 15 years, or even longer. He has a hereditary tendency towards renal failure but this will normally show up before 15 months of age. Other inherited disorders include Diabetes Mellitus, similar to human Type 1 can occur in middle age, also progressive retinal atrophy which leads to blindness. Heart failure is more common than in some other breeds. Hip dysplasia is a concern, and rarely Sebacious adenitis, an autoimmune skin condition.

Schipperke,Small: Weight Male 12 – 18 lb (5.5 – 8 kg) Female 12 – 16 lb (5.5 – 7 kg) Height Male 11 – 13” (28 – 33 cm) Female 10 – 12” (25 – 30 cm,"The Schipperke originates from Belgium, where it was used for hundreds of years on barges where the dogs guarded the boats and killed vermin like rats. Even though the Schipperke is only a small dog, they have a highly protective nature which makes them excellent watchdogs and they were well suited to life guarding barges. The Schipperke was also popular among business owners such as shoemakers and tailors who treasured not only their guarding and hunting instincts but also their companionship. First officially recognised in the 1880s, the Schipperke breed standard was subsequently written in 1889. The name ‘Schipperke’ was thought to mean ‘little boatman’ in English speaking countries, however, in the 1920s Belgian breeders decided they’d prefer the name to come from the Dutch ‘Shapocke’ meaning ‘little shepherd’ due to the breeds resemblance to the Groenendael Belgian Shepherd.","The Schipperke is happy to live in an apartment, making them ideal dogs for people who live in an urban environment. Their small size and cheerful nature means that they are more than happy in smaller homes and they will keep themselves entertained by moving from room to room and satisfying their curiosity by exploring the home. They’re also happy to play indoors games in the floor with their owners, though a chance to run and play outside every day will be very much appreciated by your Schipperke. However, your schipperke should be kept on a leash as hid curiosity means that he may run off in search of an adventure! Your Schipperke is a natural watchdog and always has an eye on their surroundings. Whilst this makes them excellent watchdogs and very protective of their home and family, it can make them reserved with strangers. However, once they have warmed up to a person and learnt that they can be trusted Schipperkes are friendly and polite with visitors and happy to be around people.","Your Schipperke is a very loyal dog who loves his family deeply. Schipperkes are wonderful as guardians, companions, playmates and rat catchers, and care for their family very much. They have even been known to keep watch over their owners if they are ill, and lie by their side until they feel better. Your Schipperke is happy and playful, but also knows there are boundaries and will be gentle and patient when necessary, making him a fabulous pet for families with children. However, he must be socialised with other animals from puppyhood as he has a tendency to be territorial. Your Schipperke does have a mischievous streak, which has earned him the nickname ‘little black devil’, so keep an eye on him if he’s acting a bit naughty or you may find that he turns to destructive behaviour. Usually, this is a sign that he’s bored, and a walk or some play time will help him relax and become better behaved.","The Schipperke has a small and squarely built frame. The head is wedge shaped with pointed ears sat high and erect on the head. The eyes are small and dark. The face should have a foxy look to it. The tail comes in various lengths and is docked in Canada and the United States of America. The coat is a double coat, with a thick, long and harsh outer coat and soft, dense undercoat. There should be a thick ruff around the neck, giving a mane like appearance, as well as longer fur on the hind legs which are called culottes.","The Schipperke’s coat commonly comes in a solid black colour, but can also be found in tan, red and brown.","The Schipperke has an average intelligence, so training isn’t always easy. However, with firm, fair and consist training, as well as some patience on your part, your Schipperke can end up a polite, well-mannered and obedient dog. Due to the fact that your Schipperke is so energetic and curious, he can lose interest quickly so keep your training sessions short and intense. Your Schipperke responds well to positive, reward based training and will not do well with harsh, severe or heavy handed training methods.","The Schipperke’s long, thick coat does need some care and attention. Brushing regularly with a firm bristle brush and using a dry shampoo only when needed, should be enough to keep your Schipperke’s coat clean and healthy. You may need to reach for the brush or comb more often during the shedding seasons which happen two or three times per year and during which the schipperke blows his undercoat. Warm baths may also help to loosen the shedding undercoat during these times of the year. During the rest of the year, your Schipperke is an average shedder, though this does mean that no clipping or trimming of the coat is needed.","The schipperke is an incredibly hardy breed with no common major health issues. However, if your Schipperke does not get enough exercise or is over fed, he may develop excessive weight gain which leads to joint problems as well as issues with the heart, lungs, digestive system and the teeth. Around 15% of the population is affected by a genetic mutation called MPS IIIB, which is related to brain disease. A test has been developed to check for the disease and no dogs carrying the genetic mutation should be bred. When buying a puppy or dog, be sure to ask the breeder for confirmation that MPS IIIB has been tested for in the puppy’s parents. The average Schipperke lifespan is between 17 and 18 years, however they have been known to live for over 20 years.","('Utility',)",Urban types Families with children Couples People who are active Fishermen and boaters,Active and energetic Inquisitive Loving and loyal Spirited Good watchdog
Schnoodle,Small: Weight 7 – 16 lb (3.2 – 7.2 kg) Height 10 – 12” (25.4 – 30.5 cm),"The Schnoodle is a cross between a Miniature Schnauzer and Miniature Poodle and combines the intelligence of both breeds with the boldness of the Schnauzer and the friendliness of the Poodle to create this little dog. The popularity of this crossbreed has grown in the past couple of decades as people seek out companion dogs who are even tempered and healthier than their purebred counterparts. The Schnoodle was developed in the 1980s and was intended to be a low-shedding, low-dander family dog. While not as popular as other ‘designer dogs’, the Schnoodle is still in demand. As a crossbreed, the Schnoodle is not officially recognised by the Kennel Club and currently there are no breed clubs or standards. The Schnoodle comes in a variety of sizes as there are three Poodle and three Schnauzer sizes but traditionally the Schnoodle is a small dog.","The Schnoodle is a happy, loyal and intelligent companion. They thrive on human attention and love being involved in family activities. They can be very protective of their family and makes a good watchdog and is non-aggressive. The Schnoodle is playful and energetic, wanting to have lots of fun and games. They can have a suspicious attitude towards strangers but is always loving and loyal to its family. They are good with children and other animals or pets.","This breed is naturally protective and loyal to its family. They are intelligent and strong willed, excelling in obedience training. They are affectionate and loyal to their family and can be very active dogs, enjoying running, jumping and playing.","As this new breed is not fully recognised by the AKC and the breed is still developing, there is not a set breed standard yet but the Schnoodle should have a good temperament and good health with a good blending of the Poodle and Schnauzer qualities. Coat: The coat is intended to resemble the coat of a Schnauzer puppy in that it is soft and way. It should not be wiry or have the tight curls of a Poodle. This breed is a low-shedder and hypoallergenic.","The coat can come in black, grey, silver, brown, white, apricot, sable, black and white, black and tan and even parti-colour.","This breed benefits from early socialisation and training. They are intelligent and quick to learn, excelling in obedience training, agility, flyball and competitive obedience. This breed responds well to positive reinforcement and requires a patient, firm and fair handler.","The amount of grooming required will depend on the coat. A Schnoodle with a rough, wiry coat will not require as much grooming as those with a silkier coat. This breed does not shed much but the silkier coat requires daily to weekly brushing as well as professional grooming every two to three months. There is not specific breed cut for the Schnoodle, and most groomers give the Schnoodle a general groom with rounded or squared semi-long hair left on the face. It is important to check and clean the ears regularly.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. Exercise: The Schnoodle is an active little dog and does require a good amount of exercise. They benefit from a daily walk and a good amount of play. They are suitable for apartment dwelling provided they are given plenty of exercise but do not do well if left alone for long periods of time as they can bark or become destructive. They are not suited to living outdoors. This breed excels in obedience training as well as activities such as flyball and agility.","('Crossbreeds are not recognised by the AKC',)",Singles Families with older children Retirees,Happy Loyal and affectionate Intelligent Playful
Scottish Terrier,Small: Weight Male 19 – 22 lb (8.5 – 10 kg) Female 17.5 – 20 lb (8 – 9 kg) Height Male 10 – 11” (25 – 28 cm) Female 10 – 11” (25 – 28 cm),"There is some confusion as to when the Scottish Terrier originated, with experts arguing that they either date back to the 19th Century or the 15th Century. There is no mention of the Scottish Terrier breed until 1859 and even then, they were referred to as the Aberdeen Terrier in relation to the area where they were most commonly bred. In fact, for a long time a number of terriers, including the Skye and Yorkshire Terriers, were all named as Scottish Terriers. This confusion angered many breeders, so in 1880 the first Scottish Terrier Clubs were set up in England and Scotland. The Scottish Terrier is closely related to the West Highland Terrier and both breeds are considered to be the oldest of the Highland Terriers. The Scottish Terrier was bred to work on farms, where they hunted vermin and small wildlife from underneath rocks and in burrows, as well as keeping them out of barns.","The saying ‘never judge a book by its cover’ has never been truer than with the Scottish Terrier! It’s important not to be fooled by this small dog’s size. He is bold, courageous and brave and can be scrappy when he wants to be. His fearless nature, combined with his drive to protect his family, makes your Scottish Terrier a fantastic watchdog. He will show no fear if confronted by an intruder or if he senses danger and will go out of his way to make sure the family he is so loyal to is safe. Their protective character can make them wary of strangers and your guests may wonder why your Scottish Terrier seems aloof and unfriendly, but he is just sizing them up and ensuring they aren’t a threat. When properly introduced to new people and socialised from a young age, your Scottish Terrier will be polite and charming with your guests.","A highly intelligent dog, your Scottish Terrier is bold and brave, yet dignified and elegant. They are deeply devoted to their owners, however you have to earn their love by treating them with respect and giving them plenty of affection and attention. You Scottish Terrier is very independent and won’t be friends with just anybody. They can seem serious at times, but they do have a playful side which they reserve for their families. Though they usually get on well with other household animals, they are dominant dogs and can show dog aggression if they are not well socialised with other dogs and pets from an early age. While your Scottish Terrier gets on well with older children, they can be inpatient and don’t tend to be tolerant of younger children who can be rough or unruly. It’s important that children are taught to be gentle and respectful around your Scottish Terrier.",,"The Scottish Terrier most commonly comes in solid black, but dark brindle and wheaten are also recognised by the Kennel Club. Some Scottish terriers can be grey or grizzled black, although these colours are not recognised by the Kennel Club.","Your Scottish Terrier is not an easy dog to train. While he may be intelligent, he is also fiercely independent and it can be hard to get him to do things that he doesn’t want to do. Training needs to be based on mutual respect and should be positive and reward based. It’s very important to socialise your Scottish Terrier with other dogs, animals and humans from an early age as they can be dog aggressive and territorial if allowed to be.","Your Scottie’s coat is prone to tangles, so he should be brushed at least twice each week, with daily brushing required during shedding season. Regular trims are also required to keep his coat in its characteristic appearance. Particular attention should be paid to the hair around the mouth, where food may get trapped.","The Scottish terrier is prone to a number of health conditions, including epilepsy, cancer of the bladder, hypothyroidism and Von Willebrand Disease, a blood disorder. They are also prone to ‘Scottie Cramp’ in which spasms in the limbs, back and tail occur and cause the muscles to lock up for a few minutes at a time. This tends to occur after exercise. Your Scottish terrier is also prone to skin disorders and is very sensitive to flea bites. The average lifespan of the Scottish Terrier is 15 years.","('Terrier',)",Couples without children Retirees Urban or country folk People who like the great outdoors Families with older children,Intelligent Independent Active Proud Loyal Playful
Sealyham Terrier,"Weight: Male: 23-24; Female: 18-22 lbs
Average height to withers: Males and females both up to 10 inches.","The Sealyham terrier originated in Wales in the middle of the 19th century. Sealyham terriers were developed through crosses with the now-extinct small white Cheshire Terrier. Moreover, West Highland Whites, Fox Terriers and Corgis are all thought to have contributed to the development of this breed. Captain John Edwardes developed the breed but unfortunately did not keep records of the breeding lineage. His aim was to produce a distinct, white haired Terrier, which he could see easily in the field while hunting. By 1908 a club dedicated to this dog was opened and 3 years later the UK Kennel Club recognised the breed. Over the years, Sealyham Terriers have been used to hunt otters, badgers, foxes, vermin and stoats. They were bred to be a very tough dog, and to do this, breeders used to cull the weaker pups and just keep the stronger ones for breeding purposes to establish a well-defined set of physical and behavioural traits. At one time they were one of the most popular Terrier breeds. Today, however, they're uncommon and are considered by Great Britain's Kennel Club to be one of that country's most endangered native breeds.","The Sealyham terrier is a hardy and muscular breed. They are proud, compact, and charming. They are lively, bold, vigorous, and exhibit a robust nature. The Sealyham is a jaunty and jovial companion that has a deep depth of devotion to their owner and family. The Sealyham terrier is highly intelligent and affectionate. They are extremely loyal, independent, and spirited. They are not rambunctious as is usually a trait of the terrier breed. The Sealyham terrier is very vocal and makes a good watchdog. They thrive on being an integral part of the family. He will want to be with you wherever you go, and enjoys snuggling up to you on the sofa. He is friendly, calm, and relaxed, and does wonderfully with respectful children.","The Sealyham's nature and temperament enchants people. While it is less active than the most Terrier’s, this breed has the adopted name of the ‘couch potato of terriers’. At the same time though, this breed has a wonderful sense of adventure and fun and is always ready to play! Due to its hunting heritage, it typically gets along well with other dogs in the home, as well as people, although it can be reserved toward strangers until it knows and trusts them. He is playful well into his elderly years. He can be quite wilful, but he wants to please his owner and once trained, is quite obedient. He is an intelligent dog and needs something to keep his active mind occupied.  Although they are intelligent and very charming, Sealies can sometimes exhibit the stubbornness that most Terriers are well known for. To maintain your position as leader of the pack, you must display a firm and consistent hand and the ability not to laugh at their comic antics as you reprimand them! As a pet and companion, you won't be disappointed. They are real people pleasers and like to be around children and this little dog adapts well to modern lifestyles and is comfortable in both city and country. Inquisitive, self assured, loyal and happy, this dog always delights.","Sealyham Terriers aren't big dogs, but they have long, broad and powerful heads coupled with well-muscled bodies. Their eyes are dark, deep set and sparkle with intelligence. The ears are folded level with the top of the head and the forward edge lies close to the cheek. The white coat is dense, wiry on top, with a downy undercoat providing a warm and quite weather resistant layer.. Being quite low-slung dogs with long hair, they are typically found with a line of mud around their midriffs where the hair can trail along the ground – unless groomed and cut.","Any solid colour including sable. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black","The Sealyham terrier has a tendency to be difficult to train. They are quick to learn, but may try to undermine their master's authority. They do well with early socialization and obedience training. Sealyham Terriers respond best to firm, fair, and consistent direction. They enjoy agility exercises and are enthusiastic participants. However, you will need to be extra patient when Training him.","The Sealyham terrier requires professional trimming and stripping of the coat. They need to be brushed twice weekly to prevent mats from forming. Bathing should only be done when necessary using a mild shampoo. Dry shampoo as needed. This breed does best in cooler climates. The Sealyham terrier sheds practically no hair at all. You'll virtually never find a hair in your house. The Sealyham terrier also enjoys its food, so the owner needs to keep a close eye on its weight! The Sealyham terrier requires moderate exercise. They enjoy securely leashed walks. They thrive on family activities and play sessions. The Sealyham is well suited for apartment and condominium living, but is equally at home in the country setting. He has moderate exercise needs and does fine with just a brisk daily walk. He also loves to play ball and enjoys earth dog competitions.","Sealyham Terriers have very few health problems. They are allergic to fleas, are prone to deafness, and may have skin sensitivities. Overall the Sealyham is a robust dog, which suffers from few conditions or diseases. It can be prone to an eye condition called ‘lens luxation’. This is caused by a weakening in the fibres which hold the lens of the eye in place, causing it to slip out. It can cause permanent optic nerve damage if left untreated. In good health, it can live up to 15 years of age, sometime longer.",not available,Families Live best with older considerate children City dwellers Countryside homes,Couch potato Lively Compact Charming
Sharpei,"Weight: Male, 55 to 65 lb (25 to 29 kg) – Female, 40 to 55 lb (18 to 25 kg) Height: Male & female 18 to 22 in (46 to 56 cm)","The Shar Pei breed comes from the Guangdong province of China. The original Shar-Pei from China looked very different from the breed now popular in the West. People in southern China, Hong Kong, and Macau differentiate the Western type and the original type by calling them respectively 'meat-mouth' and 'bone-mouth' Shar-Pei. The ancestry of the Shar-Pei is uncertain. It may be a descendant of the Chow Chow. However, the only clear link between these is the blue-black tongue. However, pictures on pottery suggest the breed was present even in the Han Dynasty (206 BC). A statue on display at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts dating from the second century A.D. depicts a dog that strongly resembles a modern Shar Pei. For many years, the Shar-Pei was kept as a general-purpose farm dog in the Chinese countryside, used for hunting, protecting and herding stock and guarding the home and family. During that time, the Shar-Pei was bred for intelligence, strength and its scowling face. Recent genetic research has suggested the Shar-Pei is one of a few ancient dog breeds, believed to have split from common ancestors earlier than other breeds. Later, it was used for dog fighting. The loose skin and extremely prickly coat were developed originally to help the Shar Pei fend off wild boar, as they were used to hunt. Dog fighters used these enhanced traits to make the Shar-Pei difficult for its opponent to grab and hold on to, and so that if it did manage to hold on, the Shar-Pei would still have room to shift and bite back. Their most intriguing feature, in this respect, is that if one grabs them by any loose wrinkle, they can actually twist in their skin and face in one's direction. This trait was used in fighting as a means for them to fight back; they would be bitten and twist in their skin to bite back at the offender. During the Communist Revolution, when the Shar Pei population dwindled dramatically dogs were rescued by a Hong Kong businessman named Matgo Law, who appealed to Americans in 1973 through a dog magazine to save the breed. Around 200 were smuggled into America. The current American Shar Pei population stems mainly from these original 200. DNA analysis has concluded that the Shar Pei is one of the most ancient dog breeds","The Chinese Shar-Pei is a unique and intelligent dog most often recognized for its wrinkles. All Shar-Pei need early socialization with children, strangers, and other animals. Like other fighting breeds, they can be stubborn, strong-willed and very territorial. Early training can help control these traits before they become problem behaviours. They will be fine with cats if they have been introduced to them when puppies but there can be problems mixing with other dogs. They love being indoors and hate the cold.","The Shar Pei is often suspicious of strangers, which pertains to their origin as a guard dog. It is a very independent and reserved breed. Nevertheless, the Shar Pei is extremely devoted, loyal and affectionate to its family and is amenable to accepting strangers given time and proper introduction at a young age. If poorly socialized or trained, it can become especially territorial and aggressive. Even friendly and well-socialized individuals will retain the breed's watchdog proclivities (such as barking at strangers). It is a largely silent breed, barking only when playing or when worried. The Shar Pei was originally bred as palace guards in China. The breed is amenable to training but can get bored from repetition. Overall, the Shar Pei can be a dog that is loyal and loving to its family while being very protective and independent.","Initially developed for Chinese farm and hunting and later a fighting dog, the breed does well today in obedience, agility, herding and tracking, with skills that would have been needed on the farm. Because the name Shar-Pei means ""sand coat"", harshness is a distinctive feature in its two accepted coat types, either horse (short) or brush (up to an inch long). Other unique qualities include black mouth pigment, a slightly ""hippo-like"" head shape, small ears, deep-set eyes and rising top-line. Horse-coat (unusual but regaining ground), rough to the touch, extremely prickly and off-standing, soft in one direction and harsh in the other; Brush-coat, with longer hair and a smoother feel; and Bear-coat (rare, and not recognized by the AKC; Bearcoats are not due to the addition of other breeds), Bearcoats were actually the part of the breed owned mostly by wealthy aristocrats in China prior to Mao's cultural revolution and the first to be exterminated by the regime for being considered bourgeois. The shorthaired examples of the breed were owned by the peasant class, and were used for working dogs and fighting due to their loose skin. Bear coats can be seen in Chinese art throughout history, and are considered to be one of the oldest breeds on earth. There is a type of Shar Pei called ""traditional"" that is most popular in china and that is more faithful to the history of the breed. If a Shar Pei is being attacked the wrinkles will allow the dog to move and strike back while being bitten and keep the internal organs from being injured badly. Shar Peis are easily recognisable by the loose folds of skin on their bodies and their ‘frowning’ expressions. They are squarely built and short-coupled and look powerful with good bone. They are a compact, square, muscular dog with a blocky head that brings a hippopotamus to mind, blue-black tongues, tiny ears that lie against the head, and a short, curled tail.They are balanced dogs that should move freely and vigorously. Their coat is also a distinctive feature of the breed: it is short and bristly and harsh to the touch. Whilst it is straight and standoffish on the body, it is flatter on the limbs.","The Shar Pei exhibits solid colours of black, red, light or dark shades or fawn and cream and can be shaded on the tail and the back of the thighs with a lighter colour.","Whilst highly intelligent, this breed does need consistent training and a confident handler. It will reverse roles if you are too soft, too uncertain or too inconsistent. The Shar Pei needs a firm, but gentle, extremely consistent authority figure. The dog must be taught all humans are above him in the pecking order. Those who see themselves as above humans will be stubborn and bold. This breed needs firm obedience training to establish your leader-ship. They are very easy to house break as they are naturally very clean.","The folded skin of this breed needs a lot of attention to keep it in good condition, and stop skin problems developing. Some lines have very close-set tails and these must be inspected and cleaned to prevent infection. Shampoos must be chosen with care and, as the nails grow very quickly, must be trimmed regularly. The eyes as well should be inspected daily. The coat itself just needs a going over with a soft brush. They do need exercise, but enjoy playing as well as running and walking. They will need daily walks to keep them happy and healthy. Care must be taken when they are off the lead and a well-enclosed area/garden is a must. Shar Pei do not like to get wet, and bad weather may well put them off going out. As Shar Pei are sensitive to heat exercise should be undertaken in the cooler parts of the day and shade and fresh water should be available at all times. They are quite expensive to keep as quality food should be used, although the protein levels should not be high. From 6 months of age, they should be fed adult food.","Due to its fame after being introduced to North America in the 1970s, the breed suffered much inexperienced or rushed breeding. This resulted not only in a dramatically different look for the Shar Pei (as its most distinctive features, including its wrinkles and rounded snout, were greatly exaggerated) but also in a large number of health problems. Allergy-induced skin infections can be a problem in this breed. Familial Shar Pei fever (FSF) is a serious congenital disease that causes short fevers lasting up to 24 hours, usually accompanied by accumulation of fluid around the ankles (called Swollen Hock Syndrome). These fevers may or may not recur at more frequent intervals and become more intense. Amyloidosis, a long-term condition, is most likely related to FSF, caused by unprocessed amyloid proteins depositing in the organs, most often in the kidneys or liver, leading eventually to renal failure. There is no early test for FSF, but as it is congenital, the dog is either born with it or without it, and if one attack occurs (usually brought on by excessive emotional or physical stress), the dog will always be susceptible to another. With proper care, a Shar Pei with FSF can live a completely normal and long life. The disease is associated with the western type and it is estimated that 23% are affected. The Australian breed standard was changed in 2009 to discourage breeding for heavy wrinkling. A common problem is a painful eye condition, Entropion, in which the eyelashes curl inward, irritating the eye. Untreated, it can cause blindness. This condition can be fixed by surgery (""tacking"" the eyelids up so they will not roll onto the eyeball for puppies or surgically removing extra skin in adolescent and older Shar Pei). The Shar Pei is also prone to chronic yeast infections in its ears. This is due to the tight ""flap"" that the ear creates over the canal, allowing a moist environment. Vitamin B12 deficiency is a common problem in the Shar Pei and is suspected to be hereditary. They are expected to live from 8 – 10 years and their average litter is 5 puppies.",not available,City Dwellers Families Singles Those who live in hot climates,Wrinkled Strong-willed Affectionate Loyal
Shetland Sheepdog,Weight:  Male & Female 12 - 18 pounds Height: Male & Female 12 - 15 inches,,"A sweet disposition, this loveable breed does have a very strong herding instinct often nipping at ankles and chasing cars. This is a home breed and should not be kept in a kennel like environment. The Shetland sheepdog is very affectionate and lovely, yet can be protective of his owner and/or territory. This dog loves being an in-home companion and would gladly lie down on the couch next to his family. They are high energy, active, very trainable, this breed has a well-rounded and even temperament making him ideal as a household pet. The Shetland sheepdog does well with children, but children should be properly trained to handle a dog of any breed. Used as a watch dog, this gentle breed will not attack without being repeatedly provoked so does not do well for guarding. Great for herding, this dog is still commonly used for herding purposes in a country environment and does exceptionally well.","The Shetland sheepdog is one of the most trainable and loving breeds there is. They are incredibly intelligent and in tune to their owners thoughts and moods. They can be almost psychic when it comes to knowing what you are feeling. If you want to play, your Sheltie is ready to play. If you are sad, your Sheltie will show concern with a worried look and a few kisses. If you are not in the mood, your Sheltie will give you your space. They are also devoted companions and family dogs and are especially fond of children. They will want to be involved in everything you do and go everywhere you go. They will follow you from room to room, including the restroom. They are also protective, especially of ""their"" children, and will bark a warning whenever someone nears your door. They are sound sensitive and bark at all strange sounds, even the ones you never hear. Barking can be a problem with Shelties, as they seem to have a lot to say. They are very expressive and talk to you with whines, groans, grunts and a thousand different barks. (They can also smile.) Not only will they bark at you, they may also try to herd you. But it's not personal. They will also try at herding children, bicycles, joggers, cars, ducks, and sometimes airplanes. They are usually naturally distrustful of strangers and should be socialized early in life. They are safest in a home with a fenced-in yard. They are peaceful other dogs and animals. A Sheltie needs to be a part of the family. They are an intensely loyal dog and will not do well if left alone.","Shetland sheepdogs have small, sturdy and light frames with rough, long coats (they show a slight resemblance to a miniature version of the longhaired Collie). Their heads have a long, noble shape with tapered muzzles, raised ears and watchful, almond-shaped eyes. Their long hair creates a mane down the sides of the head and neck. They have a double coat—long and rough on the outside, short and dense on the inside. Their bushy tails hang down. Overall, Shetland Sheepdogs have a well-proportioned, symmetrical shape.","The Shetland sheepdog comes in lack, blue merle, gold and sable, marked with varying amounts of white and/or tan","The Sheltie is very easy to train and does very well in obedience and herding given the right methods and trainer. Having a human like intelligence, Shetland sheepdogs are willing to obey, and are very eager to do so. They do very well in working environments being that the herding instinct is still very strong. They tend to bark… a lot but proper training and socialization from an early age can help to alleviate barking.","Regular brushing is necessary to keep the coat smooth and free of tangles. The long coat of the Sheltie does tend to trap dirt so supervision is necessary unless regular bathing is not a problem. The Shetland sheepdog is a very heavy shedder. You'll find hair all over your home, stuck to everything. The medium-length coat of the Shetland sheepdog only requires an occasional brushing. Due to the fact that he sheds excessively you may find yourself brushing him daily to remove loose hair (What you get out with a brush doesn't fall out in your home). Apartment/city living may not appeal to Shelties. They need loads of exercise and “tasks” to satisfy their curiosity. This high-energy breed should have regular exercise. Most prefer to allow their Shelties to run free but must be in a fenced in yard, as this breed loves to chase things and will surely bolt if given the opportunity and visual stimulation. An average sized yard would be ideal for this small yet lively breed. With superb herding instincts, excellent quickness and docile natures, Shelties are the perfect farm worker, guard dog or hiking pal.","Common health issues include allergies, overheating, eye problems and hyperthyroidism.

Siberian Husky,Height: Male: 21-23.5 inches; Female: 20-22 inches,"Siberian Husky. These hardy, even-tempered dogs were not simply used as pets or helpful working dogs: the Chukchi people relied on them for survival. As dog sledges were the principal means of transport, these huskies were of paramount importance to them. They herded reindeer, pulled sleds and worked for long hours in the cold. Up until the 19th century, the Chukchi people were the only breeders of this particular sled dog. In the early 1900s, Americans in Alaska began to import these dogs for sledding competitions. But their fame spread even more rapidly when a team of Huskies helped transport lifesaving antitoxin to Nome, Alaska during a diphtheria epidemic. The Siberian Husky's endurance, stamina, and strength quickly made them a popular breed in the Arctic region.","Siberian husky will be content hanging out on the couch for a cuddle or playing a mellow game on the carpet. The Siberian husky also has a mischievous side: they can become restless and destructive when left alone for too long. An easy way to combat this, aside from giving them attention, is to get them a Siberian husky pal.   These dogs are devoted to their families, but they are also excellent hosts when guests come over, rarely barking or acting territorial. Overall, what they say is true: Huskies are everybody’s friend. In light of this, they are not the best guard dogs. Whilst they do not often bark, they will howl, often just for the joy of it!","The breed is known for its good temperament and its suitability in a family environment. They love and need company and should not be left alone for long periods of time or they can become very destructive. They will be happy with other well-adjusted dogs but are keen and efficient hunters so contact with other household animals needs careful handling and training. The Siberian husky is a compact and strong working dog. They are able to withstand temperatures as low as 75 degrees below zero, so are best suited for cooler to cold climates. They display a measure of dignity and reserve. The Siberian husky has an affectionate, gentle and friendly disposition. They are alert and eager to please. They are highly intelligent and have an independent spirit, which can sometimes be a challenge to their owner. Whilst the Siberian husky thrives in a family environment, it does not become overly attached to one specific person.","These are medium-sized dogs whose proportions show off their balance of power, speed and endurance. They are quick and light on their feet and move in a seemingly effortless manner, with good reach in the front and good drive from behind. The Siberian husky has a medium length double coat. The under coat is dense and soft in texture. The outer coat is longer and coarse with straight guard hairs. The head is finely chiselled and fox-like in appearance, with the muzzle being of medium length and width. The stop should be clearly defined but not excessive. The nose should be black in grey, tan or black dogs; liver in copper dogs and may be flesh-coloured in pure white dogs. The eyes are almond-shaped and can be any shade of blue or brown, one of each colour or parti-coloured. The medium sized ears are triangular in shape and set high on the head, strongly erect and the inside edges should be quite close together. The jaws should be strong with a complete scissor bite. The neck should be of medium length and thickness, arched and carried proudly when standing. The front legs should be moderately spaced, parallel and straight with elbows set close to the body. The upper thighs should be well muscled and powerful, with well-bent stifles. The body should be straight and strong with a level top line from withers to croup, slightly longer than the height from the shoulders to the withers. The chest should be deep and strong. The feet should be oval and slightly webbed between the toes. The tail is well furred, similar to a fox's brush and is usually carried as a sickle over its back when at attention","Their coat comes in a variety of colours and patterns. The most common colours are black and white, grey and white, copper red and white, and pure white.",,"The Siberian husky is by nature clean and free from body odor. They require daily brushing to minimize excess loose hair, tangles, and mats. Bathing should only be done when absolutely necessary with a mild shampoo. Shedding can be an issue with Siberian huskies: During normal times, their coats need only occasional grooming.  However, during their shedding seasons (spring and fall) they need daily brushing with a metal comb to prevent hair from getting all over everything. Whilst they do need correct feeding, they are not fussy eaters and do not require as much food as other breeds of the same size demand Siberian husky in the early hours and turn on the air conditioning inside. The Siberian husky has an innate and deep desire to run. They do best with a large securely fenced yard. If they are left alone for extended periods of time they will become bored which leads to digging and destruction. They make excellent walking and jogging companions provided they are very securely leashed and the climate is not too hot. The Husky is not recommended for apartment dwelling unless they are exceedingly well trained and sufficiently exercised.","Common health issues include hips dysplasia, eye problems and hypothyroidism. Siberian Huskies used for racing can often develop gastric and bronchial problems. However on a whole they have a low susceptibility to illness. A healthy Siberian husky can live as long as 16 years of age. They do not have large litters; the average is 6 pups and fewer than this is common. However litters of 12 have also been known.",not available,"Singles Families with older children Active, sporty types Cold-weather dwellers Alaskans",Mellow Cuddly and warm Friendly and tame Intelligent
Skye Terrier,"Weight: Male & Female 25 - 40 pounds (Males may weigh up to 11kg, with females being slightly less).",,"The Skye terrier is more serious, dignified, and quieter than most other terriers. They are one of the few terriers, which are laid back and easy to please indoors. The Skye Terrier will require at least one walk a day, and as a very happy dog will like to play at any time of the day. Once outside, however, it is a fearless and courageous breed and will chase anything that runs. With this in mind, it is probably best to keep this dog on a lead unless you have a reliable recall in place or it is being exercised in a safe and well-fenced area. They can become quite dominant little dogs, especially if they are not socialised very well as youngsters.  Caution should be exercised if they live with or are around smaller creatures, for example rabbits and cats. This dominant and sometimes stubborn trait means that they need a confident leader, which they can trust and respect. They can be intensely loyal to his family pack, enjoying a lot of attention and thriving on contact with people. It is not a breed that likes to be left alone for prolonged periods of time.","The Skye terrier has a typical terrier temperament: courageous, canny, strong, and independent. He is fiercely loyal to those he loves, but people have to earn his love and respect. He does not give it freely. He is selective about whom he will love and whom he will obey. Once he chooses you, his loyalty and devotion are profound. He usually attaches himself to one member of the family, whom he follows around like a shadow. A Skye will not tolerate being picked up or handled by anyone except his closest loved ones. He is sensitive to rebuke, but never submissive. And he is perfectly capable of holding a grudge. He is an alert protector of home and master -- always watchful. Skye terriers are friendly and happy and are also trained as therapy dogs. He is usually quiet in the house and is content to sit beside his master for hours. He often lives peacefully with other dogs. He does not look for trouble but if he is provoked, he will not back down. The Skye terrier can be serious and he can be clownish. He is a loving, faithful, and adoring companion for the person(s) he chooses to love. He craves attention and companionship and gives it right back.","The delightful little Skye terrier is a long and low-slung dog, with short legs and a straight back leading into a tail that is held level to the body. The head is quite long and the ears can be either erect or folded, but either way they are covered in heavy feathering. In the erect eared dogs, the hair falls between the ears, forming a ‘fringe’ of hair, which covers most of the face. They have a moderate beard covering also. The coat is double, with a shorter undercoat and a longer, straight over coat. The parting on the head, continues down the centre of the dogs back down to the tail and hangs in curtains down either side of the dogs body. The overall dog should look elegant and have an overall body length to height ration of 2:1.","The coat colour comes in many shades of fawn, cream, grey or black, often with darker points and on occasion, white markings on the feet or chest.",,"The long and straight coat of this dog is surprisingly easy to maintain, as it seems to resist tangling. As such, a thorough grooming once a week should be all that is needed. Resist over bathing unless the coat is exceptionally dirty. The long hair between the pads of the feet should also be trimmed back if possible. Their long, straight coats should be brushed regularly to prevent matting. During shedding seasons, you may want to brush them outdoors or have them professionally groomed. Skye Terriers will be happy in apartments but they need lots of exercise and companionship—not just playtime around the living room. He also does well in obedience, rally, agility, and tracking competitions.","Being a dog with short legs and a long body, the owner must always be aware when they are climbing up or down the stairs or jumping off furniture etc. In addition, in pups they may display signs of a disorder called ‘Skye Limp’. This is caused by damaged to the growth plates in the bones, and can be caused by over exerting a young dog. This can lead to bowed or deformed legs, leading to issues in later life such as rheumatism and difficulty in its gaits.  Degenerative Disc Disease is seen in around 10% of all Skye terriers and is a chronic and very painful disease of the spine, leading to stiff and painful movements for the dog. The owner needs to prevent movements such as the ones described above with regards to jumping off furniture, cars etc to prevent further injury.

Sloughi,not available,"This breed is truly a living piece of history, revered by the Bedouin tribesmen, and as highly valued as an Arabian horse. In the days of the great Sheiks, the Sloughi was one of the most prized possessions, and you can imagine what happened if anyone should harm a Sloughi! They are as noble and proud as the Bedouin themselves, who decorate the Sloughi with talismans and amulets. Bedouin women have been known to nurse Sloughi puppies should the need arise. When a Bedouin goes visiting, his Sloughi is treated with the same respect as any honoured guest, and tribesmen will willingly give up their blanket for their Sloughi should they be cold. And when the Sloughi dies, the grief of the Bedouin is apparent and the hound is mourned with much dignity. There is evidence of the Sloughi dating back to the Ancient Egyptians, and indeed a mummified body of a Sloughi has been discovered in a tomb.","It is of a sensitive nature yet is an alert and intelligent hound. It is said that Sloughis have a mighty longing for moving and that is not easy to keep them in flats with families; however, a Sloughi does not need more exercise than other dogs of similar size. It loves variety, walking on the leash, romping in the countryside, and racing. A Sloughi is faithful to his owner and it needs him close by. Sloughis are easy to bring up and to train, if you know how to do it. Because the Sloughi is somewhat sensitive, its training should not be oppressive, and any punishment should be omitted. What it likes is a friendly confirmation of its behaviour.","The Sloughi is tall, elegant, and slender. They exude a noble, graceful, and aristocratic persona. Extremely athletic, this breed is capable of jumping great heights and is a swift runner. They are active, alert, highly intelligent, and possess a fastidious and gentle manner. The Sloughi forms a strong and deep emotional attachment to their master and family. As a result, they do not change ownership easily. They are cautious, aloof, and wary with people they do not know. This breed is a reliable and dependable watchdog. The Sloughi is not recommended for the novice dog owner. They do best in a home with older considerate children and with household pets they have been raised with. They have a strong emotional sensitivity and do not do well if stressed or if there are changes in their routine. This breed requires a harmonious and peaceful home environment. The Sloughi does not do well if left alone for extended periods of time either indoors or outdoors, as they will become bored and destructive. They are not recommended for a two-career family.","The Sloughi is a medium sized, short-coated dog.","The coat comes in such colours as light sand, mahogany red, red with black brindle, or red brindle. There are typically black or white markings.",,The Sloughi requires occasional brushing with a firm bristle brush. Bathing or dry shampooing should be done only when necessary as they have very dry skin. They do not do well in cold climates. This breed is prone to progressive retinal atrophy and hemophilia. It is important to remember that the Sloughi is a sight-hound and will chase anything and everything that moves. With the capability to reach speeds of 37 mph this breed will become so focused on the object they are chasing that they quite quickly find themselves in perilous danger. This breed is an average shedder.,,not available,Families Children Country dwellers Hunters,Don’t change homes easily Independent Inbuilt desire to hunt Good with children
Small Munsterlander,not available,"In the 1800's bird dogs in Germany came in all shapes, sizes and coat colours. In the latter part of the 19th century, because of the growing interest in the individual breeds, the different types were all separated. When the German Long-Haired Pointer Club drew up its standards, for some reason, the only colour allowed was liver and white. Litters with all colourations were produced and the black and white puppies, many with excellent bloodlines, were given away to farmers and hunters from the Munster area in Germany. Colour did not matter to them and, so these puppies were bred, possibly bringing in other breeds, for example, spaniel or setter types. Until 1919 the Large Munsterlander was given recognition in his own right to differentiate him from the smaller version. Originally a dog bred to work with noble families' falconers before guns were used in bird and small game hunting, ancestors of the Small Munsterlander had to work in upland areas to flush prey for the falcon, then allow the falcon to keep the prey until the falconer could retrieve it while the dog pointed at the catch. To this day the Small Munsterlander has excellent close searching and pointing drive. With wider availability of guns and personal time for commoners, hunting became more popular, and the breed was further developed as a retriever that worked equally well in the field and water. Owners of the breed consider it to be uniquely effective in working as a team with the huntsman in all phases of the hunt, akin to the close cooperation between a sheepherder and Border collie. By the 1800s the breed had fallen into obscurity. Small Munsterlanders were little known, kept by a few families on farms around Munster.

They're especially hard to come by for non-hunters there. They are more numerous in Germany, the Netherlands, and the Czech Republic. In the United Kingdom, the breed is less common still. Recognised by The Kennel Club as an imported breed in 2006, they are still to be established in the hunting community. <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>
    Munster,  Spion in Germany Heidewachtel in the Netherlands. Breed History: In the 1800's bird dogs in Germany came in all shapes, sizes and coat colours. In the latter part of the 19th century, because of the growing interest in the individual breeds, the different types were all separated. When the German Long-Haired Pointer Club drew up its standards, for some reason, the only colour allowed was liver and white. Litters with all colourations were produced and the black and white puppies, many with excellent bloodlines, were given away to farmers and hunters from the Munster area in Germany. Colour did not matter to them and, so these puppies were bred, possibly bringing in other breeds, for example, spaniel or setter types. Until 1919 the Large Munsterlander was given recognition in his own right to differentiate him from the smaller version. Originally a dog bred to work with noble families' falconers before guns were used in bird and small game hunting, ancestors of the Small Munsterlander had to work in upland areas to flush prey for the falcon, then allow the falcon to keep the prey until the falconer could retrieve it while the dog pointed at the catch. To this day the Small Munsterlander has excellent close searching and pointing drive. With wider availability of guns and personal time for commoners, hunting became more popular, and the breed was further developed as a retriever that worked equally well in the field and water. Owners of the breed consider it to be uniquely effective in working as a team with the huntsman in all phases of the hunt, akin to the close cooperation between a sheepherder and Border collie. By the 1800s the breed had fallen into obscurity. Small Munsterlanders were little known, kept by a few families on farms around Munster. For a half century the few dogs that were bred were primarily companions, and used when hunting to feed the family rather than for sport. It developed a local reputation as the dog to have when a hunter's success or failure determined whether his family would have enough to eat.

Smooth Collie,not available,"The exact origin of the collie is unknown, but it was descended from generations of hard working herding dogs. For centuries the Rough Coated Collie was hardly known outside Scotland. Early Rough Collies were smaller, with broader heads and shorter muzzles. The dogs were used as water rescuers, herders, guiding cows and sheep to markets and for guarding the flock in Scotland and England. The breed's name probably comes from the Scottish black-faced sheep called the Colley. In the 1860’s Queen Victoria kept Collies at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, making the dogs very popular. J.P. Morgan along with other wealthy people owned Collies. In the late 1800's the Collie was mixed with the Borzoi. The working dogs separated, branched out and became the different breeds (with the Scotch Collie remaining) and the show type became what we see now, the large dogs with flatter faces. The Rough Collie is much more popular than the Smooth Collie. The Smooth Collie is more popular in Great Britain than it is in the United States, but is gaining some popularity in the States. The Smooth Collie is the same as the Rough Collie, but without the long coat. The AKC considers the Rough and Smooth Collies as varieties of the same breed and are judged by the same standard with the exception of the coat.  The first Collie was presented at a dog show in 1860. The Collie was recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1885. The Collie is well known for its role in the movie ""Lassie"", featuring a Rough Coated Collie as the main character. The Collies talents include herding, search and rescue, guide for the blind, agility, competitive obedience, acting in the movies, and as a guard and watchdog.","Smooth Collies are friendly, never nervous or aggressive. They develop close bonds with their families and make excellent companions. They are versatile, clever and will enjoy activities such as agility and fly ball. The smooth collie should always be treated with a positive manner avoiding physical abuse or harsh verbal treatment; this applies equally to any training. Smooth Collies are friendly, active and intelligent dogs with no traces of nervousness or aggression. They make good housedogs that bond very closely with their families and will get on well with other dogs and household pets. Collies are good companions for children, always willing to play. They are quick to bark if a stranger is about but also quickly make friends with invited guests","They are natural herders and puppies may try and herd humans and need to be taught not to do this. They are faithful, playful, docile and protective of family members and good with children. Collies have an uncanny sense of direction. They are good-natured, friendly dogs. They are energetic outdoors. Socialize them well to prevent them from becoming wary of strangers. They are not aggressive, but they do tend to be suspicious of people they sense unstable vibes from. Daily pack walks are important. Without a firm, but calm, confident and consistent owner who set rules and stick to them, they can become wilful, stubborn and indolent. This breed should be trained gently but with an air of authority or he will refuse to cooperate. A clean breed, the Collie is relatively easy to housebreak. Some owners report that Rough Collies do not like the water due to how heavy their coat gets when wet. Though some Smooth Collies have become successful at water","They appear alert and active, stand with dignity and are always in proportion - with the appearance of working capability. The body should be slightly long with well sprung ribs, a deep chest and fairly broad behind the shoulders, the shoulders should be sloping and well angulated the forelegs straight and muscular. The hindquarters should be muscular at the thighs. The eyes have a sweet expression. The Collie is a large, lean, strong dog. The top of the skull is flat and the eyebrows are arched. The head is wedge-shaped and the muzzle is rounded tapering to the black nose, with a slight stop. The face is chiselled. The teeth should meet in a scissors bite. The medium sized eyes are almond shaped. Eye colour is dark brown accept for blue merles, where the eyes may be blue or have one of each colour. The small ears are 3/4 erect with the tips folding forward. They should not be to close together or too much on the side of the head but again in proportion The neck is fairly long. The body is slightly longer than it is tall. The legs are straight. The tail is moderately long with an upward twist or swirl at the end and is carried low.  The smooth coat variety has a short one-inch coat all over the body.","Coat colours on both the rough and smooth variety include sable and white, tri colour of black, white and tan, blue merle or predominantly white with sable, tri-colour or blue merle markings.",,"The breeder will give you a diet sheet for your puppy, which should be followed. As adults, Collies are an easy breed to feed as they are not fussy eaters. Smooth Collies will easily adapt to family circumstances and enjoy as much exercise as you can give them. However, free running should be given, allowing them time to play. Obedience and agility are also ideal forms of exercise for these dogs. The Smooth variety has a one-inch coat and should be brushed every one to two weeks. If the long coated variety has a BIG matt, and the dog is not being used for show, the matt may need to be cut out, as opposed to combed out, as to avoid pain to the dog. Bathe or dry shampoo as necessary. The rough Collie sheds heavily twice a year, and the Smooth Collie is an average shedder.","They are generally healthy however good nutrition is important. Some collies are affected by CEA (Collie Eye Anomaly) but breeders are working to eradicate this and screen puppies and breeding stock. As with all breeds, ensure a good routine for dental hygiene is in place. Collies may need sun block on their nose as they are often sensitive to the sun. Some herding dogs carry a MDR1 gene, which makes them sensitive to certain drugs, that are otherwise okay to give another dog, but if tested positive for this gene can kill them Smooth Collies will live from 12 to 14 years. Their litter sizes can vary from 2 to 8 puppies, but 5 is the average size.",not available,Families Walkers Farmers Gentle trainers,What they say about me:- Excellent companions Inactive in doors Likes the cold Intelligent
Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier,,"the soft Coated Wheaten Terriers didn’t garner worldwide attention until their 1937 debut at the Irish Kennel Club Championship Show. No one knows for sure where or how they originated, but legend tells us that when the Spanish Armada sunk off the coast of Ireland, the little blue dogs that escaped the wreckage found wheaten-coated terriers waiting for them on shore.","This dog often stays puppyish into adulthood! It is a friendly, fun and reasonably tolerant dog, even with children and will tolerate a lot of play, even when it may not be in the mood. That said, while they are one of the few terriers that are tolerant towards children, early socialisation is still recommended as is supervised play between the child and the dog. It is defensive without being aggressive or argumentative, which is unusual for a terrier, but will always stand its ground and will protect its pack at all costs, being a good watchdog. It will bark to let the family know of unknown people at the house. Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers are lively, inquisitive, exuberant dog, but can be a true terrier in the way that it can be stubborn and headstrong. Because of this it is essential that this dog has a firm and confident leader and it knows its place in the family pack. Once this is established, it can be incredibly loyal, enjoying being with its family and hating to be left alone for long periods.","Like many terriers, it does not have the patience for canine sports, instead preferring exercise to take the shape of a good romp over-hills and woods. A good recall must be in place if the owner wants to let the dog off the lead as it will chase most moving animals, and will go to ground if necessary to catch its quarry. They are very determined dogs! It is an enthusiastic greeter, and will often jump up to lick a person's face, commonly referred to as the ""Wheaten greetin”. If socialized with cats as puppies, they may get along fine with them. If not, care should be taken in introducing them to cats, as the breed has a very strong ""prey drive"" because of its vermin-hunting origin. Wheatens can get along well with other dogs if properly socialized. They are extremely friendly and loving pets. Wheatens are very protective of their families and, although they may bark an alert at strangers, they rarely get aggressive. Many Wheaten owners thus say they make great watch dogs, but poor guard dogs.","The Wheaten Terrier is a medium sized dog with a ‘squarish’ shape. Its hair does not shed like many dogs. Like the Poodle, it carries on growing and therefore sheds very little. As it says in the name, the hair of this dog is beautifully soft and woolly. Pups are born a darker red, brown or black and they develop the characteristic golden wheat colour as they mature, reaching its final colour by a couple of years old. The coat sometimes is a darker colour at the tips of the outer guard hairs and if there is any damage to the skin underneath, the overlaying hair grows back a darker colour similar to a scar.  The nose is always dark, and the eyes display a quick intelligence. They have a ‘beard’, which serves to enhance their boxy shape. The solid neck angles into a straight and strong back, with well-muscled hindquarters. The tail was customarily docked, however, however, from 2007 this was effectively banned in the UK, with permitted exceptions, (as defined by the Docking of Working Dogs Tails (England) Regulations 2007 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006). This ban also extends to the showing of some dogs with docked tails, with the exception of dogs that are demonstrating their working skills. This is something to bear in mind when buying a puppy as heavy fines can be imposed if someone is found to be in contravention to these Regulations","Puppies have dark coats of either red, brown, mahogany or white. Their muzzles and ears may be black or dark brown. The adult coat may contain black, white, or darker brown ""guard"" hairs in addition to the lighter wheaten-coloured hair. If adults ever have skin injuries, the resulting hair growth will be the dark colour of their puppy coat before it eventually grows out to the wheat colour.",,"The woolly coat does require attention, optimally each day. It is quite a thick coat, which does not shed as much as some other breeds, and attention should always be paid in hotter weather. Exercise should be restricted to the cooler parts of the day to prevent overheating, and access to shade and water provided. It has a lot of energy and will require ongoing walks and stimulation. These dogs do best when they are exercised regularly. They are cool weather dogs and can become easily overheated in hot weather","The soft Coated wheaten terrier is generally a healthy breed. They are susceptible to various heritable diseases, although are most known for two protein wasting conditions: protein-losing nephropathy (PLN), where the dogs lose protein via the kidneys and protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), where the dogs fail to fully absorb protein in their digestive tracts, causing it to pass in their stool. Both PLN and PLE are potentially fatal, but if caught early enough, can sometimes be managed with strict dietary changes and pharmaceuticals. can live as long as 15 years.

Spanador,Medium: Weight 20 – 50 lb (9 – 22.5 kg) Height 18 – 22” (45.7 – 56 cm),"The Spanador is a cross between a Labrador Retriever and the American Cocker Spaniel and they are known as ‘designer dogs’ because they are not purebred and are generally healthier than purebreds.. Nor are they recognised by the AKC. Breeders chose to mix these two dogs to produce a dog smaller than the Labrador and more intelligent than a Cocker Spaniel alongside being even tempered and easy to care for. Most crossbreeds are of smaller dogs but the Spanador was created in response to the demand for a medium sized crossbreed. While not as widely known and being relatively new crossbreeds, they are gaining in popularity.","This breed is affectionate and loving and can be very good with children provided they are well socialised from an early age. They are very intelligent making them easy to train obedience and easy to house train. They can get excitable and boisterous at times, jumping up at people but this behaviour can be discouraged through proper training. The Spanador is a happy, loyal and friendly dog who loves everyone and enjoys playing games and carrying a ball around.","This breed is not aggressive but they can be excitable and enjoy a good play fight. They are sweet and playful but can initially be reserved with strangers. As with a lot a crossbreeds, the focus is on creating an even tempered dog but the temperament ultimately will depend on the parents.","Usually the Spanador is medium sized yet smaller than a Labrador but some may grow to this size. Tails are kept long and not docked like some other Spaniels. The general conformation of the dog will be influenced by its parents but if there is a stronger influence from the Spaniel side, the dog will have a shorter muzzle and more domed skull. Coat: The coat is either smooth like a Labrador or with feathering around the chest, shoulders, ears, stomach and hind legs as seen in the Cocker Spaniel.","Breeders tend to use a lighter coloured Cocker Spaniel in keeping with the cream Labrador but the coat colour can vary from light gold to darker gold or if a dark Cocker Spaniel is used, the pups may be black. The coat may also have some white patches.",This breed is intelligent and easy to train. They can be excitable and prone to jumping up at people but this can be discouraged if proper training is given from a young age. Early training and socialisation is recommended for this breed.,"The amount of grooming required will depend on the inherited coat. If the coat is longer and feathered like the Cocker Spaniel, regular daily brushing is required but if the coat favours the short Labrador style coat, infrequent brushing is required. The coat is not required to be clipped. Depending on the coat, the Spanador can be a low to heavy shedder.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 15 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. Like most crossbreds the Spanador is quite hardy and healthy, not suffering as many ailments as purebred breeds. However, some health issues such as hip dysplasia prevalent in the Labrador and Cocker Spaniel may arise in the Spanador so it is wise to check the parents for any diseases that could be inherited. This breed may suffer from dry skin and it is important to check and clean the ears regularly. Exercise: This is an active breed that needs a lot of exercise. They are not suited to apartment dwelling and need access to at least an average sized yard alongside daily walks. They can be boisterous and benefit from a lot of play and exercise to burn off their energy. Be careful not to walk them too far when they are young to let them properly develop without straining their muscles.","('Crossbreeds are not recognised by the AKC',)",Active singles Families with older considerate children Active families Joggers,Loyal Happy Friendly Affectionate
Spaniel American water dog,Medium: Weight Male 30 – 45 lbs (13.5 – 20.5 kg) Female 25 – 40 lbs (11 – 18 kgs) Height Male 15 – 18” (38 – 46 cm) Female 15 – 18” (38 – 46 cm),"The exact origin of the American Water Spaniel is not known, however it is thought that the breed comes from the Great Lakes area, including Wisconsin and Minnesota. Most experts agree that the American Water Spaniel was developed from the Irish Water Spaniel and Curly Coated Retriever. During the 18th Century the American Water Spaniel was used as a working dog on farms and in hunts. It is the first American breed to be developed to retrieve and hunt, and was treasured by American Water Spaniel enthusiasts as an excellent hunting dog. These American Water Spaniel fans were very protective over the breed and keen to retain its qualities as a hunting dog, going as far as to try to prevent the breed becoming recognised by the American Kennel Club as they believed it would ruin the American Water Spaniel reputation. However, the American Water Spaniel was finally recognised by the AKC in 1940. The American Water Spaniel was bred to be able to catch the scent of game as well as flush them out, and is also a strong swimmer. The breed’s qualities make him a multipurpose hunter who can work in marshes, lakes, open ground and woodland. In the early 1900s the breed’s numbers began to decrease, due to a reduction in the number of ducks in the Great Lakes area and the movement of hunting from a way of gathering food for the home to a hobby. After World War II the number of American Water Spaniels was further diminished as setters, pointers and other spaniels gained popularity. The American Water Spaniel was announced as the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985, however the American Water Spaniel still continues to be a rare breed.","The American Water Spaniel is a more relaxed character than most spaniels, being less excitable and more balanced, but retains retrieval skills which could rival a Labrador or retriever.

Spanish Water Dog,not available,"The Spanish Water Dog or Perro de Agua Español is a breed of dog developed by the shepherds in Spain as a multi-purpose herder who was also used sometimes as a gundog, as well as an assistant to fishermen. There are many different theories as to its origin and history. Records suggest water dogs have been around the main wetlands of the Iberian Peninsula since ancient times. Portuguese and Spanish water dogs are clearly related and have a common ancestor. Regardless of its exact origin, it is documented that there was a wooly coated Shepherd Dog on the Iberian Peninsula around 1100 AD. What is then for sure is that this a very ancient and rustic breed, very well adapted to the climate and terrain conditions found in the wetlands and coastal mountains of the Spanish shores. Historically, the SWD were primarily used as Herding dogs to move the flocks of sheep and goats from one pasture to another. The dogs were also called upon to work wherever a dog was required. For example, they were taught to work with fishermen as well as being taught to retrieve when hunting with the farmer In about 1975, two enthusiasts, Antonio García Pérez and Santiago Montesinos travelled around the countryside of Southern Spain, through the remote villages and farms of the mountainous region of Andalusia and bought or borrowed a number of dogs from the shepherds that they felt most fit the type they were looking for to establish a breeding program. In 1980 the Spanish Water Dog Club (Spain) was formed in order to promote the breed and help get it recognised in its own country. In 1985, after a lot of hard work and displaying the breed at various venues and dog shows the Spanish Kennel Club accepted it and gave it official status. It was provisionally recognised by Fédération Cynologique Internationale until 1999, when it was permanently recognised",The Spanish water dog is a loving and affectionate dog. The breed is a very versatile worker and possesses a protective nature.,"The Breed Standard describes them as ""faithful, obedient, brave, good tempered and gay."" They are truly versatile, fitting into family life with ease, provided you have the time to exercise their mind. As the name implies, they love water (at least most do) and love walks or retrieving games. A good companion for children, and should alert you to strangers approaching. Therefore they make acceptable guard dogs.","The Spanish Water Dog is a medium size, athletic, robust dog that is slightly longer than tall. Their tails are usually docked in the US, but undocked tails are not a fault in conformation showing if the dog was bred in a non-docking country. The head should be strong and carried with elegance. The skull is flat and the top is parallel with the top of the muzzle. The nose, eye-rims and paw pads are the same colour as the darkest part of the coat or darker. The eyes are expressive and set fairly wide apart. They should be hazel, chestnut or dark brown in color, depending on the coat colour. The ears are set at medium height on the skull, and are triangular. They have a distinctive curly coat, which is woolly in texture and may form cords when long. The coat should not be clipped or groomed for aesthetic purposes. Instead, it should look entirely natural, as though it is not groomed at all. It should never be trimmed, but sheared down at least once a year. Spanish Water Dog puppies are always born with curly hair.","The Spanish Water Dog can be seen in a variety of colours. It may be black, beige, brown, white or bicolour where the second colour is white (brown and white or black and white). Tri-coloured dogs are strictly prohibited by the currently held (worldwide) standards for the breed.  This is also the case for black and tan or brown and tan colour combinations",,"Spanish Water Dogs require minimal grooming. They should never be brushed, instead, as the cords grow they should be checked for matting. When matting does occur they should be gently pulled apart without tearing the cords. If there is too much matting the cords should be sheared. Spanish Water Dogs should be bathed only when dirty in lukewarm water. Spanish Water Dogs should be allowed to air-dry. The cords must be sheared one or more times a year. Ears and eyes should be cleaned as often as they are dirty. As with all dogs nails should be trimmed. Spanish Water Dog puppies should be trimmed for the first time at around the age of 4 months.","Recent health testing has uncovered the following issues include hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (prcd-PRA), hypothyroidism, addison's disease, allergies and cataracts.

Standard Schnauzer,Medium: Weight Male 40 – 45 lb (18 – 21 kg) Female 35 – 40 lb (16 – 18 kg) Height Male 18 – 20” (46 – 51 cm) Female 17 – 19”(42 – 48 cm),"The Standard Schnauzer originates from Germany and dates back to the 15th Century. The Standard Schnauzer is the oldest breed of Schnauzer and created the Mini and Giant Schnauzer. The breed was developed from a combination of Spitz, Poodle and Pinscher breeds and was bred to work on farms, keeping vermin such as rats out of barns and herding livestock. However, the Schnauzer was soon discovered to also be an incredibly protective dog, making him an excellent watchdog, and they were used to protect travelling merchants’ wagons during the night. Their working skills and protective nature combine with the fact that Schnauzers make wonderful companion animals to make the breed a popular choice for families in Germany and surrounding countries like Switzerland.","The Schnauzer has an affinity for children and was once famed across its native Germany for being incredibly protective over children and making sure that no harm can come to the children in their family. This trait still remains in the Schnauzers we know and love today, and they are excellent pets for families with children of all ages as they are not only protective but playful, patient and gentle. Your Standard Schnauzer is a generally quiet dog, though he will bark when they sense danger or a threat to the household or family. This makes your Schnauzer a fantastic watchdog as he is alert and watchful, and won’t hesitate in raising the alarm should there be trouble.","Your Standard Schnauzer is a loyal and loving dog with an incredibly playful side, however he is also extremely intelligent and reliable. A true companion dog, your Standard Schnauzer loves to be near you and thrives on human company, so he doesn’t like to be left on his own for long periods of time. Your Schnauzer’s protective nature makes him wary of strangers, so you can expect him to be aloof and reserved with visitors and people he hasn’t met before. A born rat- catcher and hunter, your Schnauzer should not be allowed near smaller household pets and should be socialised with other dogs from a young age as they can be territorial and dog aggressive. Your Schnauzer can be stubborn and wilful, so plenty of obedience training is necessary from puppyhood.","Standard Schnauzers are stocky, muscular dogs with a square, medium sized frame. The head is rectangular, with oval shaped eyes, V shaped, high set ears and a blunt muzzle with a jaw which meets in a scissor bite. Longer hair is featured on the eyebrows, beard and moustache, giving a very distinctive appearance. The long, arched neck should be strong and slope down to straight topline. The chest is deep and broad while the body length should be the same as the height at the withers. The front legs are straight and the rear legs muscular. The tail should be carried high as well as being high set. The Standard Schnauzer’s coat is thick, harsh and wiry with a dense undercoat.",The Standard Schnauzer’s coat commonly comes in solid black or salt and pepper. White coats can also be found but they are quite rare and not seen in the show ring.,"Standard Schnauzers are very intelligent dogs and can be wonderfully trainable, however they do have a stubborn side to their personality and they therefore need a strong minded and confident owner who will make sure they know who is boss. Plenty of early socialisation and obedience training is needed from an early age in order to ensure they do not act aggressively towards other dogs, as they can be territorial. They have been known to confront much larger dogs when out on walks and are completely fearless. Firm yet fair training is vital to show your dog what is appropriate behaviour and what is not appropriate.","Your Standard Schnauzer will benefit from a daily brush to ensure that his wiry coat doesn’t become matted or tangled. A short wire brush is best suited to the task. The longer hair around the eyes, ear and mouth may need the occasional trim. The Standard Schnauzer is a low shedding breed and therefore may be suitable for people with allergies. Bathing or dry shampooing should take place only when necessary.","The Standard Schnauzer is a relatively healthy breed, however they can develop eye problems and hip dysplasia. Older Schnauzers can be prone to heat failure, which is a common cause of death for the breed as the dogs reach old age. The average lifespan of the Standard Schnauzer is around 12 years, though they have been known till live till about 17 years old.","('Utility',)",Experienced dog owners Families Farmers and country folk Active people People who like the great outdoors,Protective Intelligent Stubborn Wonderful companion Good watchdog
Sussex Spaniel,Medium: Weight 40 – 44 lb (18 – 20 kg) Height 13 – 15” (38 – 41 cm),"The Sussex Spaniel originated in Sussex, England in the 1800s and is credited to Mr Augustus Elliott Fuller who kept them as working dogs on his large estate. Not particularly fast or boisterous, it was nevertheless a determined and loyal companion in the field. The Sussex Spaniel Association was formed in 1924. Despite there being other Sussex Spaniel breeders, the popularity of this breed declined dramatically by World War II resulting in only five known Sussex Spaniels remaining in 1945. Mrs Joy Freer then devoted her life to breeding the Sussex Spaniel and her dogs worked well in the field. Today in the UK there is still a very small gene pool for this breed. The Sussex Spaniel was recognised by the Kennel Club in 2004 as a Vulnerable British Breed and at its lowest in 2010 only 52 puppies were registered.","Unlike most other Spaniels, the Sussex Spaniel prefers a slower pace of life even though it can be energetic. It is an excellent field dog and displays the natural ‘quartering’ ability shown by Cockers and Springers. Once trained they can be very obedient but can be a bit stubborn and decides when it wants to learn. This breed is playful, fun loving and happy with children which can be enhanced by early socialisation. This breed really likes people and is happy to curl up with its owner for a cuddle after a walk. Their sedate and relaxed behaviour makes them excellent PAT therapy dogs in hospitals, schools and hospices.","When the Sussex hits the open field, its hunting instincts take over and the energy level really picks up. It romps through forests, fields and streams, barking and baying at birds, squirrels and the like. The Sussex Spaniel is clever and loyal, but sometimes it can have a mind of its own. This breed has a cheerful disposition and can be wilful at times. They are not as quick to learn as some breeds so require patience with training and they are happy, loyal dogs to their owner. This breed is adaptable and laid back but require early socialisation when they are young.","The Sussex Spaniel is similar in shape to the Clumber Spaniel and is low, small and compact. The ears are typical of all Spaniels – long, pendent and set moderately low on the head. The eyes are usually a lighter brown or amber colour. This dog has profuse feathering on the belly, legs and tail. The Sussex Spaniel has a long, low, rectangular frame covered in a wavy, feathered coat that usually comes in a nice golden liver. Its broad, flat-topped, slightly indented head has a heavy brow, a wide muzzle, brown nose, hazel eyes and large, feathered ears that hang close. Its thick tail, sometimes docked, is normally carried horizontal or high. This breed is heavily built with short yet strong legs. The neck should be long, strong and slightly arched. They have a well developed deep chest that is not too wide or round. They should appear level and have no apparent waist from the withers to the hips. They move with a distinctive rolling gait. The coat is silky, soft and can have a slight wave to it",The preferred colour for the show ring is rich golden liver with the hair shading to golden at the tip. Dark liver is undesirable. They are a rich golden liver colour shading to gold at the hair tips.,"While intelligent, the Sussex chooses when it want to learn, and so responds best to positive and reward based training methods. The trainer must also be capable of showing considerable patience and always finish a training session on a high note to reinforce the good work done. They make very good pets, but they need plenty of socialisation when young. It is important that they are introduced regularly to children, dogs, cars etc when young. This socialisation should be kept up until the dog is mature.","This breed requires frequent grooming, preferably every day and may also benefit from professional grooming ever 2-3 months. The hair under the feet and ears benefits from regularly being trimmed. The longer ears of this breed have a tendency to trap moisture and dirt underneath so it is important to check and clean the ears regularly.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 10 and 12 years, which is normal for a dog of this size. However, some live for as long as 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is hardy and on average lives up to 15 years of age. They have relatively few genetic health issues but the most common problems in this breed are heart problems, ear infections, hypothyroidism and eye problems. They can also suffer from hip dysplasia. Exercise: Be careful not to over exercise this breed as a puppy. They require stimulation to prevent them becoming bored and can be very energetic but do not require excessive amounts of exercise.They do best in the country where they are free to run and roam.","('Gun Dog',)",Retirees City-dwellers Outdoorsy types Experienced dog handlers Families,Playful Energetic Loyal Intelligent
Swedish Vallhund,Small: Weight 25 – 35 lb (11.5 – 16 kg) Height Male 13 – 14” (33 – 35 cm) Female 12 – 13” (31 – 33 cm),"The Swedish Vallhund is originally of Viking blood and has been identified as similar to the Welsh Corgi although which breed came first is debatable. Over the centuries, very little change was injected into the breed and they worked on Swedish farms driving cattle and controlling vermin. The breed did begin to reduce in numbers and by 1942 was verging on extinction. Count von Rose and Herr K G Zettersten set up a breeding programme to increase the genetic pool for the breed, searching out three suitable bitches and one dog. One of the bitches used was thought of as being the ‘ideal’ Vallhund and her measurements are still used in today’s breed standard. The breed was introduced to the UK in 1973 when an in-whelp bitch was imported. Another two bitches and a dog followed shortly and these four dogs formed the foundation UK stock.","This breed is alert, active, happy and playful. They are solid workers and make good children’s companions as they are versatile and fit in well with family life. This breed will guard property and people and is generally fine with other animals but caution is advised with small animals.","The Swedish Vallhund is friendly and active. They are eager to please and devoted to their family. They get on very well with children, protecting them from any strangers who attempt to get too close to them. They will accept other dogs, although care should be taken with small animals.","This breed is strong and robust with a fairly long body, having a similar physique to a Corgi. On closer inspection they are longer in the leg, with smaller mobile ears and a wedge shaped head. The head should be rather long with a clean-cut blunt wedge and a well-defined stop. The muzzle should be rather square and slightly shorter than the skull. The lower jaw should be strong. The eyes should be medium-sized, oval and very dark brown. The medium-sized ears should be pointed, pricked, smooth-haired and mobile. They should have a scissor bite. The neck should be long, strongly muscled and with good reach. The front legs should be well-boned and straight when viewed from the side. The hind legs should be well-angulated, with well-bent stifles and low hocks. Again the legs should be well-boned and have strongly muscled thighs. The back should be well-muscled and level with a short, strong loin. Harness markings should be clearly defined. The feet should be medium-sized, short and oval, well-knuckled up and with strong pads. If docked, the length should not exceed 10cms when adult and should be carried horizontally or slightly downwards. It may be raised at attention. If undocked, it should be set on as a continuation of the croup line and be carried naturally. The movement should be free and active, with elbows fitting loosely to the sides. The front legs should move well forward without too much lift with a powerful thrusting action coming from behind. Coat: The coat is short and smooth.","The recognised colours are steel grey, greyish brown, greyish yellow, reddish yellow, reddish brown with darker guard hairs on the back, neck and sides of body. Lighter hair of the same colours is desirable on the muzzle, throat, chest, belly, buttocks, feet and hocks or, alternatively white markings are acceptable but never in excess of one-third of the total colour.",This breed is quick to learn and eager to please making them easy to train. They adore agility and obedience training,The Swedish Vallhund require regular combing and brushing to keep the coat in good condition. They normally shed once a year and are free from dog odour.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 15 years.If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This is a healthy, robust breed with no specific health problems. However, ear passages should be checked and cleaned on a regular basis. Exercise: This breed has a moderate exercise requirement and makes a good jogging partner and enjoys short runs. On average this breed benefits from 40 - 60 minutes of exercise a day and can do well in an urban environment provided they are sufficiently exercised.","('Pastoral The Swedish Vallhund is a member of the pastoral group.

Tibetan Mastiff,Extra Large: Weight 140 – 180 lb (64 – 82 kg) Height Male 28 – 29” (71 – 73.5 cm) Female 25 – 28” (63.5 – 71 cm),"The Tibetan Mastiff is an ancient breed which has been largely unchanged over the centuries due to the remoteness of its native lands on the Tibetan Plateaus. Locally they are known as “Do-Khyi” which means “tied dog”, reflecting the fact that they are often tethered to the entrance of their owners tents or houses. It is thought that many other breeds descend from the Tibetan Mastiff such as the Newfoundland and Pyrenean Mountain Dog. For thousands of years this dog has worked in conjunction with the Lhasa Apso, guarding Tibetan temples and palaces. They began to appear in other countries when Alexander the Great took them with him on his travels around the world. At first, these Tibetan dogs were seen as curiosities in England and were placed in zoos. In 1847 the Viceroy of India, Lord Hardinge, sent one of these dogs named Bhout to Queen Victoria, although there is no record of any subsequent breeding from it. The Tibetan Mastiff we know today has been known to exist outside Tibet for over a century. In the 1880’s the Prince of Wales owned at least one of these dogs, and the breed standard was created in the 1930’s.","This breed is fiercely loyal and protective of its family and home. It makes an outstanding guard and watch dog and is best suited to an owner with experience of this type of dog. While it is thoughtful, quiet and calm, this breed requires strong, firm and consistent leadership otherwise it will establish itself in the dominant place in the household. They can be very affectionate and gentle when treated with respect. The Tibetan Mastiff has a dignified manner and is calm and gentle with family members. They make a great cuddly pal and beloved friend. They are respectful and caring with children but can be slightly reserved and aloof around other dogs and strangers. This breed requires proper socialisation and training to mould its protective instinct. Overall, the Tibetan Mastiff has a strong sense of independence combined with a need for family time and affection.","This breed naturally wants to guard and protect its family and territory. They require early socialisation because sometimes this breed can be aggressive and stubborn. Most are very gentle, patient and loving with people and children they know but are generally distrusting of strangers. This breed is calm, thoughtful and dignified but can also be stubborn, dominant and self confident. This breed can be a nocturnal barker with a loud booming voice.","This breed is a massive dog with sturdy and quite heavy bone structure. The body is slightly longer than its height. The massive head is wrinkled, broad, heavy and strong with a square shape to it and the muzzle. The large nose is black and the upper lip usually covers the lower lip. The slightly slanting and drooped eyes are almond shaped, brown, deep-set and not to large considering the size of the head. Ears are a pendent V shape which hang forwards. The head is supported by a very muscular neck, which gives ways to a level, strong back. The feathered tail is held curled over the back. Coat: The double coat is very heavy, durable and thick with a heavy mane around the neck and shorter hair on the head. The legs and belly are feathered profusely.","The coat desired are black, black and tan, brown, shades of gold or grey and grey with gold markings. Limited white is allowed on the chest and toes. They can have tan markings on the muzzle, above the eyes, lower part of the legs and on the tip of the tail.",This breed requires proper socialisation and training from a young age. They require consistent and firm training as they can be stubborn and dominant so ensure this dog knows its place within the family. They do not respond well to harsh or heavy handed training.,"Due to its long coat, this breed needs brushing at least every other day and requires regular checking for any sign of skin complaints. This breed sheds once a year and at this time the heavy coat will come away in large chunks. During this period they require careful grooming to remove any dead hairs. When they are not moulting this breed is very easy to maintain. Once a year anytime between April – July, they have a summer moult, which can last up to 6-8weeks, They blow all their undercoat out, which comes out in clumps of wool. Their winter coat starts to grow in by August – September. Compared to short haired breeds (Mastiff, Bullmastiff etc) they do not constantly shed hairs all the time. As puppies the Tibetan Mastiff should have a nutritious diet to ensure the proper formation of the bones and joints. Supplements should not be added to the diet unless absolutely necessary as they can do more harm than good. There are reports of the adolescent dog being a picky eater. Care should be taken that the protein levels do not exceed 20-22","The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is prone to hip dysplasia and can develop skin allergies as they age. It is important not to over exercise this breed when they are young to prevent strain on their growing bones. This breed can also suffer heart problems and thyroid deficiencies. Exercise: This breed is not overly active but does require a certain amount of exercise. Daily walks of about 40 - 60 minutes per day are essential to keep this dog healthy and keep its weight under control. The young dog should have all exercise monitored while it is still growing to ensure that no damage occurs to the bones and joints. They do enjoy exercise and enjoy a ramble in the countryside and through the woods. Provided they are walked and socialised, they are very content to lay around snoozing all day, but one eye is always open on guard. They are not too keen on playing games with balls and other toys.","('Working The Tibetan Mastiff is a member of the working group.

Tibetan Spaniel,Small: Weight 9 – 15 lb (4 – 7 kg) Height 10 – 11” (25 – 28 cm),"The Tibetan Spaniel originates from the Himalayas where it was bred by Lamaist monks for centuries. The breed served as a faithful companion to Buddhist monks. Called “little lions” for their toughness and watchfulness, these canines were given as special gifts to Chinese dignitaries over the years, most likely mixing with other breeds such as the Pekingese and Japanese Chin. Though primarily kept as a companion, their keen eyesight made them excellent guard and watchdogs, alerting monks to approaching strangers or predators approaching their flocks. They were much-loved companions to the monks who would place them under their flowing robes in the winter with both benefiting from the warmth created. It is believed that the breed was brought to England in 1895 by a sailor returning from the Middle East. The breed grew in popularity during the 1920s but were almost extinct by the end of World War II. The only thing that saved them in the UK and the rest of the western world was the renewed importation of them from Tibet. A Tibetan Spaniel bitch was given to Lady Wakefield during a trip to India and gave birth to puppies in 1941 with the litter being brought to England in 1946. A second bitch was mated with one of these puppies which resulted in the foundation of the breed in England. In 1959 the number of registered had grown and the Kennel Club gave the breed Challenge Certificate status at 4 Championship Shows.","This breed makes a perfect house pet and companion. They are cheerful, friendly, playful and highly sociable with all the family. This breed is calm inside but can display clown-like behaviour when outside in its play mode. They can be wary and distrustful of strangers but are more aloof than aggressive. They are intelligent and relatively easy to train but can be stubborn particularly if their owner ‘babies’ them.

The head is delicate and small, with a dome shaped skull, pendant and dropped ears with soulful oval shaped dark or brown eyes that are spaced well apart. The muzzle is blunt and the mouth slightly undershot. Like many Spaniels, the face is very expressive and can look sad from ecstatic from one moment to the next. The tail is carried high over the back when the dog is moving and hangs slightly when at rest. The tail is heavily feathered in a fine plume. The silky double coat is of a moderate length lying flat and silky on the body, sometimes with a pronounced mane around the neck that is thicker in males than females. The front legs should have moderate bone and be slightly bowed but firm at the shoulder. The hindlegs should be well-made and strong with well let down hocks and a moderate turn of stifle. The body should be slightly longer from withers to tail than the height at the withers. The back should be level with a good spring of rib. The feet should be harelike and small and neat with feathering between the toes. Round, cat-feet are undesirable. The tail should be set high, richly plumed and carried in a gay curl over the back when in movement. When standing, it is allowed to be dropped. Movement should be quick, positive free and straight. Coat: They have a fairly short but silky coat with longer hair on the backs of the legs and a richly plumed tail carried over the back. Males carry slightly more coat than females, both have a mane of longer hair over the shoulders.","All colours and mixture of colours are permissible. Tibetan Spaniels come in all colours and mixes of colour, although the most common colour is golden",This breed is intelligent and quick to learn. They can be stubborn so they require consistent training and early socialisation,This breed will do well in an apartment provided it has sufficient exercise such as at least one walk a day or a good play. The coat requires regular attention and benefits from grooming at least twice a week and even more so when it is shedding. This breed is left natural and does not have its coat trimmed or clipped.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This breed is relatively healthy and has few hereditary conditions. It can suffer eye problems including Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) which can cause permanent blindness. Exercise: This breed benefits from a daily walk or good play. They do not require a lot of exercise and are happy to run around the house and garden. They can be escape artists so ensure that the garden is secure for them to play in. They are keen to play and participate in more exercise if given the opportunity and relish human company.","('Utility Category: The Tibetan Spaniel is a member of the utility group.

Tibetan Terrier,Small: Weight 22 – 29 lb (10 – 13 kg) Height 14 – 16” (36 – 41 cm),"The Tibetan Terrier is often called the ‘Holy Dog of Tibet’ and was bred as a utility dog and companion for monks in the high mountains more than 2,000 years ago. They were highly valued companions to monks and families and were treated like children in the family, living inside the house rather than outside like many dogs. They were bred to be tough and hardy, sure footed and reliable to ensure they could take care of livestock effectively on harsh terrain. It is said that anyone who owned a Tibetan Terrier would never sell their dog as they were considered very good luck and if sold, the owner was selling their ‘luck’ with it. They were so prized that mistreatment of them was frowned upon and families could be socially ostracised. Breeding of this breed was highly regulated and while they were never sold, they could be given as gifts. The Tibetan Terrier first came to Europe with an English doctor in the 19th century after he was given a dog in return for saving a monk’s life. Technically not “terriers,” they were called so because of their size. Today, Tibetan Terriers are adored around the world as loving companions, fierce protectors and winning competitors.","This breed is loyal, intelligent, brave and extremely affectionate and sensitive. They love family life but prefer older children rather than young children. Providing it has been well socialised from an early age it can live quite happily with other pets and is relatively easy to train. If it does not receive adequate exercise and stimulation, it can become quite boisterous and this can give way to undesirable behaviours, especially barking","The Tibetan Terrier makes a lively, good natured and loyal companion. They have an engaging personality and strong guard dog abilities. They love their immediate family when respect and loyalty has been earned but is somewhat cautious with strangers.","The overall appearance of this dog is one of agile strength and beauty. The head is solid and is in good proportion to the body. The eyes are large, set well apart and are dark brown in colour. The ears are v shaped, pendant and lie quite close to the head. The muzzle is strong with a small beard on the lower jaw. The body is square shaped, compact and muscular with the tail is set high, carried curled over the back. The Tibetan Terrier’s most distinctive feature is its coat. The  outer coat is long, flat and thick. The undercoat is thick, warm and woolly. This weather resistant undercoat keeps the dog warm even in freezing conditions – a perfect adaptation for life in the high mountains. The hair is profuse even on the head where it falls over the eyes and this dog notably has extra long eyelashes that keep the hair out of its eyes. Another unique feature to this dog is its feet. The Tibetan Terrier has broad, flat, feet which enabled the dog to herd the flocks over snow covered mountains, acting in very much the same way as snow shoes. Coat: The double coat is weather resistant with the outer coat being long, flat and fine and the undercoat is thick, warm and woolly. A straight or waved coat is acceptable but never curly. Tibetan Terriers are easily distinguished by the long drapes of hair that hang in their faces in addition to their well-plumed tails.","The coat comes in a wide variety of colours: white, golden, cream, grey or smoke, black, parti-colour and tricolour. They also come in chocolate or liver but these colours are not acceptable in the show ring.","This breed is very easy to train provided the training is done in a calm, equable manner. They can be strong-willed and stubborn and respond best to firm and kind handling.",This breed does not shed its coat but regular grooming is required whether the coat is left long or clipped. This is particularly important during the development of the coat. Excess hair should be removed from the ears and between the pads of the feet. The areas around the ears and anus should be kept clean and free from excess hair to prevent infection. The eye area too should be checked on a regular basis.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is up to 15 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. This bred is hardy and robust and does not suffer from many serious complaints. However, puppies should be purchased from parents who have been both hip-scored and eye tested as PRA, lens luxation and hip dysplasia are potential problems. They can also suffer skin allergies and be allergic to fleas so they need a frequent and consistent programme of flea, tick and parasite treatment. Exercise: This breed needs plenty of exercise and stimulation and benefits from at least two good walks a day. They do very well at canine sports such as flyball and agility to help focus its naturally high energy drive.","('Despite the name, Tibetan Terriers are not actually members of the Terrier group at all. Their history is ambiguous and in their native lands they are called the Tsang Apso. Category: Utility\xa0 - The Tibetan Terrier has no terrier characteristics and is a member of the Utility group.

Utonagan,Medium: No specified weight but should be in proportion to its height Height Male 25” (60 cm) Female 23” (58 cm),"The Utonagan (or Northern Inuit) gets its name from an old Chinook Indian tale and means ‘spirit of the wolf’. This breed is designed to look like a wolf but without the wild blood to ruin its temperament. As a relatively young breed, this dog is still being developed. They are a cross between Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian Huskies and German Shepherds. The first pair were brought to the UK in the late eighties but the breed has only become properly established in the last ten years. They were breed as companions with the look of a wold and are very adaptable, being used for a wide variety of purposes including PAT therapy dogs in hospitals, schools and hospices. They are not currently recognised by the Kennel Club","The Utonagan is a friendly, intelligent dog with a well balanced temperament which makes them wonderful companions and family dogs. They love the company of people and are quite good with children. Provided they are well socialised with other animals from an early age they can live quite happily with other household pets. They have a high pack mentality – they respect a pack hierarchy and need a firm, strong leader that they can respect.","This breed has a well balanced temperament and is friendly, intelligent and sociable without any aggressive traits. The dogs appearance has not reference to its character. They are not a dog that likes to be left alone and problems may arise if they are, such as destructive behaviour and escaping. They can be boisterous in play but do well in many activities including being PAT therapy dogs.","As this breed is still being developed, the appearance can vary from dog to dog. The main characteristics to look for when buying a puppy is a strong wolf-like appearance and powerful but not stocky build. The tail may be curled or straight and the ears are quite small and erectin relation to the head. The  eyes are usually dark and almost hypnotic and overall this breed has the impression of athletic grace, strength and stamina with the instant appearance of a wolf. Coat: This breed has a thick double coat that appears quite different in winter and summer. The guard hair is straight and slightly coarse.",The coat is usually a wolf-like grey or brown and a darker facial mask is often seen on these dogs.,"This breed is receptive and quick, intelligent learners. They respond best to a reward based training schedule. They require early traing and socialisation with firm and fair training.",This breed is an average shedder and benefits from being brushed about twice a week with more brushing required when the coat is shedding.,"The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 9 and 13 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, health problems should not occur. As this breed is still in development there is little research or data on health concerns relating to this breed. It is recognised some health implications may arise from ailments the parent breeds are prone to such as hip dysplasia in German Shepherds. Generally healthy breed, but can be susceptible to eye and hip problems, although this is rare. (Breeders now have puppies eye tested and hip scored). Exercise: The Utonagan can be quite boisterous and energetic in play and does very well in activities such as flyball and agility which focuses its energy. They have a high energy drive so regular exercise is required. They benefit from at least two walks a day but thy have the stamina to be suited to extended periods of exercise. Due to their thick coats, extra care must be taken when exercising these animals in hot weather as they can overheat easily.","('Non KC',)",Families Active singles People who like long walks People who like short runs,Sociable Intelligent Friendly

WEIMARANER,not available,"A dog closely resembling a Weimaraner belonged to the 13th Century King of France, Louis IX, but it is commonly accepted that they  are a much more modern breed, first developed by Karl August, Grand Duke  Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach at his court in Weimar, Germany, during the late  18th and early 19th Century. His idea was to breed  a line of reliable gun dogs to the nobility. This exclusivity of  ownership meant that, rather than be kept in kennels with the other  hounds, the Weimaraner lived at home with the family. Consequently, it  soon became a true family dog that hated being left alone or kennelled,  but became very versatile, being happy to go hunting with Master, or  stay at home and guard Mistress, and nanny the children as well. At  first, the German aristocracy took pains to ensure that the breed did  not spread beyond their country, even spaying or castrating any exported  dogs. Eventually however, the Weimaraner spread throughout the world.  Nowadays this energetic, devoted dog personality is most popular in  Britain and the United States, though the long haired variety is not  recognised by the American Kennel Club.","Have you got lots and lots of energy? You’ll need it, because your  Weimaraner is on the go all day long. Weims are eager to please and need  lots of attention. Set your Weim a task, and he’ll do it with  marvellous enthusiasm, especially if it involves digging. Weims can be  unruly if you don’t start training early, and you need to be as strong  willed as he is, prepared to put lots of time, and knowledge, into  socialising and discipline. A bored or neglected Weim can be an  extremely destructive force, quite able to wreck your home, not to  mention eating your socks, soiling the carpets and barking the place  down. On the other hand, your Weimaraner is a kind and gentle person,  just clumsy! Because of his size, he can easily knock a child or an  elderly person over, not to mention anything you value kept at “tail  height”, so he is probably better suited to a larger home. Your Weim is  also an escape artist, so don’t leave him alone in the garden for too  long, or he will open the gate or be over the fence and away before you  know it. Weims love to dig too, so mind your flower beds and favourite  bulbs. Your Weim is definitely a one-person dog, and although loving to  other members of the family, will be “your dog” for the whole of his  life.","Energetic, excitable, intelligent, your Weim will keep you as busy as he  likes to be himself. Your Weim may appear to be a loopy, playful clown,  but in truth he is a sensitive soul, and once bonded with you will not  leave your side. This clinginess can make him suffer severely from  separation anxiety, but once your Weim understands that you are going to  come back after going out for a while without him, he will probably  just sit at the window, waiting. Your Weim has a mind of his own, and  can be stubborn, but with time and patience your pet can learn lots of  commands, and will thoroughly enjoy playing agility games with you and  taking part in competitions. Given the right training and environment,  your Weim will make an adoring, somewhat clingy, totally devoted  companion and playmate.","Whether  short or long haired, your Weimaraner should be tall and quite rangy  with a deep chest. He should be a study in power, stamina and balance.  The head should be long and aristocratic, with a medium stop (the space  at the top of the nose between the eyes). Deep flews should enclose the  powerful jaw. The face should be straight, and the nostrils delicate.  The nose should be grey. The eyes should be medium sized and round,  placed far enough apart to give an open, friendly look. The expression  should be keen and intelligent, but kind. The long ears should be set  fairly high and slightly folded. The jaws should be strong with a  perfect scissor bite. Lips, gums and the inside of the ears should be a  pinkish flesh colour. The  length of the body should be the same length from the withers to root  of the tail as from the withers to the ground. The back should be level,  with a slightly sloping croup. The hindquarters should be moderately  angulated, but strong and muscular. The tail (undocked) should reach to  the hocks and taper towards the tip and should be carried below the  level of the back when relaxed. The webbed feet should be a generous,  round shape. The coat should be short, smooth and sleek. Long haired  Weims should have a coat no more than 1 – 2” (2.5 – 5cm) long on the  body, slightly longer on the neck, chest and belly with feathering on  the tail and backs of the legs.","Weimaraners can be any shade from charcoal blue to silver grey, steel  grey, mouse or roe grey. The coat has a glamorous metallic sheen, and  many dogs carry a dark eel stripe along the back. Occasionally, small  white marks can be seen on the chest.","Your Weimaraner needs knowledgeable training in order to fulfil his  potential, as he doesn’t always want to learn what you are teaching him  at the time! He will look bored while you try to teach him to sit, so  you give up. Meanwhile he has worked out how to open the fridge door and  steal your supper. Then the next time you ask him to sit, he will  probably do it perfectly! Your Weim may suffer from separation anxiety,  which shows up as chewing furniture, swallowing socks or bits of torn  fabric (leading to a visit to the vet!) and incessant barking. Weims can  also make an unearthly keening noise when they know you are about to go  out, or can hear you returning. Consider that he was bred to stay by  his owner’s side at all times, it isn’t surprising that he gets upset  when you leave him, but he can learn to be left for a few hours, but not  all day while you are at work. Time and patience are essential to  overcome his natural stubbornness too. And don’t forget that youthful  exuberance - it is a good idea to crate your Weim when a puppy, to help  him understand about quiet times, and to prevent unwanted destructive  habits from developing. Despite these challenges, with correct  discipline, your well trained Weimeraner will be a joy to own.","Your Weimaraner only sheds a little, so his short sleek coat will need  grooming about once a week. If he is of the long haired variety, his  feathers will need a regular brush. Weimaraners have no undercoat, so  bear in mind that they will feel the cold in winter. If like many Weims,  yours likes water, a good rub down as soon as he comes ashore will be  appreciated.","With a lifespan of up to 17 years (normally 14 to 15), your high octane  Weim should keep his health all his life, but the breed does have a  tendency to hip dysplasia, tumours and immune system problems. Like most  deep chested types, he can be prone to bloat, or gastric torsion, which  is very dangerous and will need immediate veterinary attention. Two  small meals a day rather than one large one will help prevent bloat  occurring. Also make sure you do not exercise your Weim too soon after  meals. Provided you are careful to buy only from a reputable source,  your Weimaraner should provide you with many years of happy, often  hilarious, companionship.",not available,Sporty peopleRunners and joggersFamilies with older childrenActive singles who work from homePeople who are natural leaders,

The name ‘Springer’ comes form the role it played – it would ‘spring’ birds and fowl from the ground into the air so the hunter could shoot it down. They were also used in Wales for shepherding and cattle droving. Their versatile qualities made them a popular breed.,"Welsh Springer Spaniels are very lively and affectionate gun dogs. They love the great outdoors and will walk and run all day given the chance. Their love of water and swimming is legendary. They get on well with families and are people-oriented. They will happily settle in the home at the end of a busy day. While generally considered more reserved than the English Springer Spaniel, they do need lots of company. Welsh Springers are good with children, as they are gentle and playful. They are bright and eager to please which makes them easy to train, but without enough mental and physical stimulation they can become destructive and mischievous. They are not happy being left alone for long periods of time.","As with all other dogs, the Welsh Springer should be socialised and trained from an early age to avoid aggression and dominance issues. This spirited dog by nature is an obedient, good natured and faithful breed. Springers are not aggressive dogs and will get along well with other household pets.","The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a little longer than it is tall. They have hardy, compact frames and are a medium size. They have naturally straight coats, which are soft and thick and never wiry. The coat is weatherproof. They have long feathered drop pendant ears, domed heads and dark or hazel eyes. They also have feathering on the underside of the body, on the chest and on the backs of the legs which helps protect the dog when it is swimming. They are fast movers, built for endurance, covering the ground with powerful strides. Their necks are long and muscular, set into sloping shoulders. Their tails are carried high.",Rich chestnut red and white.,"These obedient dogs are intelligent and eager to please. They are easy to train and should be given plenty of mental and physical stimulation. Due to their disposition, they do not like or respond well to harsh treatment. Reward based training is recommended.","Traditionally Spaniel’s had their tails docked, but this was banned in the UK in 2007 (except with permitted exceptions as defined by the Docking of Working Dogs Tails England Regulations 2007 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006). This is something to bear in mind when buying a puppy. The Spaniel loves water so exercise caution on walks where water may be frozen. Due to the nature of these dogs, daily brushing will probably be necessary, but this breed does not need a lot of grooming. The fur between the pads and top of the feet will need to be clipped in case thorns and burrs get stuck, so too will the ears, to avoid infection. They shed just a little.","The Welsh Springer is generally a hardy dog and has a low susceptibility to illness. The average lifespan of this breed is 12 to 15 years. Hip dysplasia may an issue, but it is no more prone to it than other Spaniels are. The Welsh Springer can be susceptible to epilepsy. This seizure disorder has no known cause. Symptoms of seizures include a far away look, twitching, falling, gnashing teeth, accidental urinating or defecating and thrashing. Seizures come on suddenly and end suddenly and can last just seconds or go on for some time. It can be treated with anticonvulsant medication. Other health issues include allergies, Glaucoma and Otitis externa. Less common concerns include cataracts.

West Highland Terrier,Small: Weight Male 15 – 22 lb (7 – 10 kg) Female 15 – 22 lb (7 – 10 kg) Height: Male 10 – 11” (25 – 28 cm) Female 10 – 11” (25 – 28 cm),"Originating in Scotland in the 1800s, legend has it that the modern West Highland Terrier was bred from the offspring of the Cairn Terrier and the Scottish Terrier. After accidentally shooting and killing his favourite dark terrier, Colonel Malcolm of Poltalloch, Argyleshire, vowed to have only white dogs. From that point on, selective breeding was practiced in order to create a hunting terrier that could not be mistaken for foxes or other vermin. It is their prized white coat that ensures that the West Highland Terrier remains highly visible on the Scottish moors. Debuted at a London dog show in 1907 and registered by the AKC in 1908, the breed was originally named as the Roseneath Terrier. This was later changed to the far catchier West Highland Terrier. A true hunting dog, the ""Westie"", as it is affectionately known, was bred to be small enough to fit between the rocks and small passageways that are typical of fox dens. Another defining feature is that the tail is traditionally longer and straighter than the majority of small dogs. This is in order to counteract the Westie’s the somewhat regrettable instinct to dive headlong into any fox/rabbit hole in sight. Often getting stuck headfirst, the tail has proven to be a useful means for owners to pull their little companion out to safety. The West Highland Terrier’s keen intelligence and boundless energy ensures that it is an ideal all-round family pet.","Your plucky little West Highland Terriers is a loyal and devoted pet, making it a great family dog for both city and country living. Westies are so faithful to their owners that they will often bark at approaching strangers, a trait that can be monitored through careful training. While these effective guard dogs are alert and courageous, they can also prove to be stubborn. It’s best to keep an eye on your self-confident friend to ensure that they don’t get up to any mischief. Your West Highland Terrier shouldn’t be left alone for too long unless you’re prepared to loose your slippers, or worse, to their eager clutches. Despite their cheekier traits, the loyalty of Westies to their family knows no bounds. They get along well with children who are old enough to respect their space and aren’t too rough with them. As well as this they are very friendly with strangers (permitting that they aren’t sneaking into the house unannounced). An affable breed by nature, Westies are also good with other dogs as long as they have been properly socialised as puppies. At times their hunting genes do kick- they have a tendency to chase cats for miles.","Get ready because your West Highland Terriers sure does love attention (and a lot of it at that). While they are generally quite headstrong and independent dogs, they do need sufficient care and activity or they can become restless. You’ll soon find that West Highland Terriers are cheeky, confident and affectionate characters who love to be played with. Always eager for a walk or run, you’ll struggle to keep up with your Westie at the best of times. Despite their diminutive stature, your friendly little companion is also very courageous, so you can sleep safe at night knowing that they are guarding the family home with all of their might. While West Highland Terriers are highly intelligent they can also be rather naughty, so it is integral that you remain consistent in their training.","West Highland Terriers should be compact, well-balanced and hardy looking dogs. Their tough frame is covered in a 2-inch white coat with an outer layer of straight hard hair and a soft under layer. They should possess shaggy eyebrows, a little black nose and small erect ears. All pigmentation should be black, from the lips, eye-rims and pads of the feet to the nails. The head is slightly domed with a distinct stop and the teeth should be large in comparison to the dog’s small size. The West Highland Terrier’s eyes should be set well apart, medium-sized and dark in colour. The muscular neck and sloping shoulder ought to lead to a deep-set chest. The front legs should be short, muscular and straight; the hind legs short, muscular and sinewy. The forefeet should be larger than the hind, round, strong and thickly padded and covered with short harsh hair. The  Westie’s distinctive tail should be long and straight with no feathering and carried jauntily. On no account should tails be docked. Overall, shaggy and small West Highland Terriers have a warm and soft look that embodies strength and activity.",Always white.,"Westies are people pleasers, so they do generally respond to well training. However they can also be very stubborn, so owners must ensure that they are firm and consistent in their training","Westies are relatively clean and odourless, but they still need daily brushing to keep their coat under control. When the dogs get dirty it is best to let the mud dry on them and brush it off when dry. They should be groomed once a week to ensure that they are kept clean and free of tangles. However, it should be noted that the beard is a particular trouble spot for matting and may need daily brushing. The coat needs to be hand plucked two or three times a year by a professional groomer.","The lifespan of a healthy individual is between 12 and 16 years. If you buy from a reputable, responsible breeder, serious health problems should not occur. However, if your Westie does achieve a good old age, the normal complaints that we all suffer from, such as arthritis and failing eyesight may begin to develop. Possible diseases include Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy, Krabbe's and Cranio Mandibular Osteopathy. Hip and elbow dysplasia can also occur. This condition can be alleviated by surgery, at some cost to dog and owner. However, it is a wise preventative measure to get your puppy hip and elbow scored if you are thinking of breeding later on. Other problems can include patella luxation, where the kneecap slips in and out of place, arthritis and cruciate ligament rupture. Some of the more common issues that they can suffer from include joint deterioration and skin allergies. However, Westies are generally hardy little dogs with few breed-specific problems being reported.","('Terrier',)",Families with school age children Active seniors Singles City dwellers,Energetic Playful Curious Adventurous
Whippet,not available,"Descended from the Greyhound, small Whippet-like dogs have been used for coursing since Roman times, though the first time the word was actually recorded in English not until 1610. By the 19th Century, Whippet racing was a national sport, more popular than football, and this was when the breed was finally fully recognised, being registered by the American Kennel Club in 1888, and the English Kennel Club in 1890. Since then, the Whippet’s versatility as a hunting, racing, exhibition or companion dog has made it one of the most popular sight-hound breeds.","Your Whippet is a proud dog, well aware of his lean, streamlined good looks. He is also very sweet natured, kindly towards children and very playful. Your Whippet is above all things a sight-hound, and will chase anything that moves, from rabbits and pheasants to squirrels and next door’s cat, though he can live happily alongside your cat if taught that it is part of the family. Thus when you go for a walk or a run, keep him on the leash because if he sees a rabbit, he’ll be gone and all your calling will land on deaf ears. Your Whippet likes lots of rest, like most hounds, and will appreciate a cosy bed of his own somewhere warm. If you live in the country, you may like to find out where the nearest Whippet racing venue is, and run your Whippet - he can reach speeds up to 40mph and will enjoy chasing a lure.","Fond of any game, your Whippet will love to play with your children, and will always be kind, even to very young ones. His favourite games are fetch and Frisbee. He is an easy going person, who will get along with everyone, including strangers and other dogs, and because he hardly ever barks, he won’t be a good watchdog or guard dog. Whippets don’t like the heat or the cold, so a jumper for winter walks, and protection from the sun in summer will help him through these extremes. Your Whippet may not wear his heart on his sleeve like a Labrador might, and may seem a little reserved, but this doesn’t mean he won’t love you as much as any other dog and your whole family too. Your Whippet is a faithful soul.","Your Whippet should look like a medium sized greyhound. He should have a lean, balanced frame with a smooth, dense coat. His head should be slender, with a long muzzle. He should have rose ears and dark oval eyes with an enthusiastic, intelligent expression. The lean neck should lead to a firm back with legs that are strong without being thick. The tail should be long and tapering.","Whippets can be black, chestnut (red), tiger striped, brindled, white or slate and can be one solid colour or mixed.","Your Whippet is fairly easy to train, but he does have a stubborn streak that might make house training a bit of a challenge, though with patience these trials can be overcome. You will also need to teach him which is your bed or chair, and which is his! Being a sight-hound, you will need to train your Whippet not to chase your other pets, like the poor cat, and remember that when you take him jogging, keep him on the leash because no amount of training will overcome his coursing instinct if he sees a rabbit.","Easy to keep, his short coat will only need a weekly brush and is easy to clean up after a muddy walk. Don’t forget, he will need a coat in winter because Whippets really do feel the cold. In summer, he can easily suffer from sunburn, so keep him out of the sun during the sunburn hours, and offer lots of water, even when you’re out walking. Your Whippet isn’t a marathon runner, he is a sprinter, so allow him lots of rest when he tells you he needs it.","Your hardy Whippet should have a healthy lifespan of up to 15 years with a correct diet, exercise and veterinary care. Being bred to course, work and race, they are structurally very sound, and hip dysplasia is unknown in the breed. Your Whippet is not prone to the ear infections, gastric upsets and skin allergies of other breeds, however does have an uneven heartbeat (cardiac arrhythmia) when at rest. This is normal, if a little startling to first time owners and vets not familiar with Whippets. The heartbeat will be regular during exercise. Like all sight-hounds, your Whippet is intolerant of barbiturate-based anaesthetics due to his low body fat. It is a good idea to take him for regular dental check-ups when he has his annual boosters, as some Whippets have a tendency to build up tartar (plaque). He will appreciate a tasty dental chew in between visits","('Hound Size: Medium: Males 18 ½ - 20” (47 – 51 cm) Female 17 ½\xa0 – 18 ½” (44 – 47 cm) Weight 19 – 22 lbs (7 – 10 kg).

Yorkshire Terrier,not available,"The Yorkshire Terrier is a pure British breed, developed during the 19th Century to catch rats in the Yorkshire and Lancashire cotton and wool mills. The foundation breeds were probably the Paisley Terrier and the Skye Terrier which were brought to Northern England by Scottish immigrants looking for work in the mills. The Maltese Terrier is another possible addition to the early mix. The breed’s nickname, Yorkie, is now used more than its original name. Although placed under the Toy Terrier section of most kennel clubs, it is generally accepted that the Yorkie is a true Terrier. Yorkies make great companions, having a huge personality for their size, great character, and charming good looks. They are also very active little dogs, and like nothing better than a good walk of about 30 minutes, lots of play time and a few ratting sessions too.","He may be classified as a Toy dog, but your Yorkie is anything but. He is a Terrier through and through. Very playful, active and alert, especially when young, Yorkies have a good sense of humour and are courageous enough to want to play with the biggest dogs in the park. Being small, they can overdo it, and appreciate some quiet time each day to recharge their batteries. They are trainable to a good level, but can be stubborn. “I Did It My Way” should be on every Yorkie’s memorial!","Full of pride and self importance, with an upright bearing, your Yorkie loves to be noticed. However, don’t make the mistake of thinking he’s a lap dog – he isn’t! He may like to cuddle up on the sofa with you, but if he feels you are under threat, or there’s a stranger outside, he’ll turn into an instant guard dog. Yorkies do bark a lot, which can be useful at times, but they can become over-protective, so thorough early training and socialisation will stop this becoming a problem. Though intelligent and capable of learning a wide range of skills, it is in a Yorkie’s genes to be independent and not rely on human guidance, so you must be prepared to put lots of time and patience into their training. Your reward will be a faithful, entertaining little friend who exudes charm and character.","Yorkies should have an upright carriage with a “look at me” presence about them. The head should be small and flat, not too round in the skull, not too long in the muzzle. The nose should be black. The mouth should have a perfect scissor bite with well spaced teeth. The eyes should be medium sized, dark and sparkling with sharp intelligence. The ears should be v-shaped and erect.  The neck should have a good reach, shoulders should be well laid with straight front legs well covered with hair. The body should be compact with a level back leading to a medium length tail with plenty of hair, carried level with the back. Hind quarters should be strong, and hind legs straight when viewed from behind. Although tough little dogs, Yorkies have very delicate bones, and many have been injured or even killed in falls, in boisterous games with other dogs or owner’s clumsiness. Coat The ideal Yorkie coat should be of medium length, silky and straight.  One advantage is that it does not shed, except at bath-time. The hair being so fine, it needs daily grooming to avoid tangles and knots.  Some Yorkies, usually those of unconventional colour, can have woolly or cottony coats, but these need just as much attention.","The standard colours, recognised by the UK Kennel Club are black and tan, black blue and tan, blue and tan, and blue steel and tan. Colours not recognised by the KC look similar, but are referred to as steel blue, steel blue, steel blue and black or steel grey. The ideal is always that the darker colour does not mingle with the tan to blur the outline, and that the tan is a deep, rich colour at the ends of the hair, fading back to a paler colour towards the body. Yorkies do come in other colours, and coats can vary too, but beware of falling for a dog with a very woolly or cottony coat, because it could mean there are genetic defects leading to poor health.","Yorkies are independent! Always remember they are true terriers, and it is in their genes to work on their own without help from humans. However, with lots of patience and repetitions, they can learn many skills. Socialisation with people and other dogs is important right from puppyhood, because Yorkies can be overprotective of their owners which can make them aggressive and bark too much. If your Yorkie’s barking becomes a nuisance, the best policy is to carry on with what you are doing, and don’t react at all. He will eventually realise he was wasting a good bark on nothing!","If you intend your Yorkie to be simply a companion, it might be easier to keep the coat, ears and feet trimmed fairly short. Despite the fact that Yorkies do not shed their coats nearly as much as other breeds, which gives them the reputation of being hypoallergenic*, they still need daily brushing and regular baths. If you want to show your Yorkie, the coat should be trimmed to floor length to allow ease of movement. However, the traditional long coat is extremely high maintenance, and care can become a full time job, involving oiling the coat and wrapping it, as the hair is so fine it easily breaks. *More often than not, it is the dander (scurf) and saliva which causes asthma in sensitive people. Equally, sufferers can be immune to certain breeds, and not to others.","Most Yorkies can live a long, healthy life of up to 17 years, but a number of health issues can affect them. If you are buying a puppy, it is important to check with the breeder if tests have been done for any genetic defects, and if not, have them done before you buy. Yorkies are prone to chest infections such as bronchitis, can suffer allergic skin reactions to injections, or other skin allergies. Vets know that Yorkies sometimes have a poor tolerance to anaesthetic, so will be especially careful. Like many small breeds with small jaws, severe dental problems can arise, but can be avoided by regular dental checks by your vet, and regular brushing with toothpaste for dogs. Don’t use human toothpaste as it is too frothy and can be swallowed. Eye problems such as in-growing eyelashes can also occur, and skeletal diseases can also arise. Cushings Syndrome is common in older dogs, as well as Cushings-related Tracheal Collapse which produces a honking cough. This can also be caused by too much pulling on the lead, so it is always advisable to use a dog harness rather than a collar. Puppies, and occasionally mature dogs, can suffer low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) if left too long between meals. Yorkies, like a lot of small breeds, can be fussy eaters. A little and often of something he likes is the best policy. If you do your homework, making sure that your little Yorkie’s bloodline is healthy and strong, so should he be. Your Yorkie should give you many years of good company and lots of laughter.","('Toy Size: Small: Height 6 – 9” (15 – 19 cms), weight 3 – 7lbs (1.5 – 4 kg). Popularity: <h3 class=""darkred"">Also known as:</h3>\n    Yorkie Breed History: The Yorkshire Terrier is a pure British breed, developed during the 19th Century to catch rats in the Yorkshire and Lancashire cotton and wool mills. The foundation breeds were probably the Paisley Terrier and the Skye Terrier which were brought to Northern England by Scottish immigrants looking for work in the mills. The Maltese Terrier is another possible addition to the early mix. The breed’s nickname, Yorkie, is now used more than its original name. Although placed under the Toy Terrier section of most kennel clubs, it is generally accepted that the Yorkie is a true Terrier. Yorkies make great companions, having a huge personality for their size, great character, and charming good looks. They are also very active little dogs, and like nothing better than a good walk of about 30 minutes, lots of play time and a few ratting sessions too. Character: He may be classified as a Toy dog, but your Yorkie is anything but. He is a Terrier through and through. Very playful, active and alert, especially when young, Yorkies have a good sense of humour and are courageous enough to want to play with the biggest dogs in the park. Being small, they can overdo it, and appreciate some quiet time each day to recharge their batteries. They are trainable to a good level, but can be stubborn. “I Did It My Way” should be on every Yorkie’s memorial! Temperament: Full of pride and self importance, with an upright bearing, your Yorkie loves to be noticed. However, don’t make the mistake of thinking he’s a lap dog – he isn’t! He may like to cuddle up on the sofa with you, but if he feels you are under threat, or there’s a stranger outside, he’ll turn into an instant guard dog. Yorkies do bark a lot, which can be useful at times, but they can become over-protective, so thorough early training and socialisation will stop this becoming a problem. Though intelligent and capable of learning a wide range of skills, it is in a Yorkie’s genes to be independent and not rely on human guidance, so you must be prepared to put lots of time and patience into their training.

Alaskan Malamute,"APPEARANCE The Alaskan Malamute is the largest of the Arctic breed s, weighing up to 56kg and standing up to 71cm tall. Females are significantly smaller than males. The most common colour is grey and white or black and white. A white or grey muzzle, face, throat and chest is common. The Malamute’s eyes are a distinct light brown, surrounded by a dark eye-rim and pale fur, giving the dog an intelligent appearance. Malamutes are classified as a long haired breed with a coarse guard coat of sufficient length to protect a woolly undercoat. This dense undercoat acts as insulation against heat and cold whilst the guard coat protects from dampness and dirt. For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website","TEMPERAMENT Alaskan Malamutes are pack animals with very strong dominant instincts. They are an extremely intelligent breed and can be very stubborn and easily bored . These traits, when combined with their size and strength, can lead to destructive behaviour such as chewing and digging, particularly as puppies. Bored Alaskan Malamutes are famous for chewing through drywall, ripping the stuffing out of sofas, and turning your yard into a moonscape of giant craters! Although their appearance is often intimidating to strangers, Malamutes lack watchdog instincts and should not be relied upon to guard the family home. Malamutes however may not tolerate strange animals. They should be socialised early with other family pets and kept under close control when outside the family home. Malamutes are family orientated and aggression towards humans must not be tolerated. Generally a quiet dog, the Alaskan Malamute does not bark . However if bored or socialising with other dogs, the Malamute may howl quite loudly and incessantly.","HEALTH AND LIFESPAN There are three major health factors relating to the Alaskan Malamute. Hip dysplasia: A heritable disease which affects the joints of the hips. This is due to the size of the breed and poor breeding practices. Before purchasing a puppy make sure the parents have been screened and passed. Day blindness: Also heritable, this disease is characterised by inability to see in bright light although ability to see in decreased illumination is retained. Again, ensure that the parents have been tested by an ophthalmologist before purchasing a puppy. Nutritional disorders: Alaskan Malamutes are a rapidly growing breed. A balanced diet must be provided to the young pup. Poor nutrition will lead to bone disorders that will remain for the duration of the dog’s life. A healthy Alaskan Malamute will live an average life of 11-14 years.",not available,not available,not available,"GROOMING AND MAINTENANCE As a long coated breed the Alaskan Malamute requires regular twice weekly grooming sessions. For these you will need a soft slicker or pin brush to remove any knotting amongst the guard and top hairs. Followed by either a rake (preferably with rotating pins so it doesn’t pull and hurt as much) or a wide toothed comb, preferably with Teflon anti-static coating so it slides through easier to remove undercoat or to tease apart tangles or mats. As you groom your dog, spend a few minutes running your fingers gently through the coat. Feel for any lumps and look for grass seeds, bindii, sores or inflammed areas. Regular grooming is important for all dogs but especially older ones. If there are paralysis ticks in your area, it is imperative that you check for these parasites daily. Females will moult twice a year (1 seasonal and 1 hormonal moult) and males once a year. During moulting season, the dog should be groomed once daily. Desexed dogs will need less grooming due to reduced hormonal influences. Malamutes will adjust to most climates and should not be clipped. Alaskan Malamutes tend to eat less than other large type breeds. This is due to their slow metabolism, a genetic adaptation to working in harsh conditions with minimal food supplies.",
Australian Cattle Dog,"APPEARANCE The Australian Cattle Dog is a strong, compact and sturdy dog, enabling him to combine great endurance with bursts of speed and the extreme agility necessary in controlling unruly cattle. They give the impression of a dog that is tough, alert and capable of quick and sudden movement. They have a strong head and broad face with upright ears. It is normal for dogs to have an initial cautious glint or look in the eye. Cattle Dogs come in blue or red, with distinctive patterns of mottling and block colour. The dogs have short powerful legs and a rudder-like thick tail that helps the dog balance and turn when moving around quickly. The weather-resistant coat consists of a short, dense undercoat and moderately short, straight outer coat of medium texture. Height: Male 46–51 cm, Female 43–48 cm Weight: Male 15–16 kg, Female 14–16 kg For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website","TEMPERAMENT Australian Cattle Dogs are loyal, courageous and devoted and possess a natural aptitude in the working and control of cattle. Australian Cattle Dog herding cattle They are suspicious of strangers and will protect the family and possessions with their life.  They are not naturally aggressive but if provoked they will not back down without a fight.  Australian Cattle Dogs love nothing better than to be able to spend time in the company of their owners, doing whatever is asked of them.  Although they can sometimes be very stubborn or mischievous, an owner should always be firm without being cruel as the Australian Cattle Dog does not learn through harsh treatment. The Australian Cattle Dog is best described as intelligent, energetic and fiercely loyal. They have been known to bite a stranger and some can be quite unstable: biting people if they look at the dog or get between the dog and its owner. A good breeder will produce dogs specifically for their temperament with breed standards an important, but secondary, consideration.",HEALTH & LIFESPAN Bluey (1910-1939) - longest living Cattle Dog Cattle Dogs are usually hardy and healthy and do not have any significant health problems. A Cattle Dog called Bluey is credited as being the longest living dog ever. He lived to 29 years of age and worked sheep for 20 of those years. Most Australian Cattle Dogs will live for about 10 to 13 years.,"HOUSEPET POTENTIAL The Australian Cattle Dog can be very active and vocal at times so from the beginning, your dog should be taught that unnecessary barking is not allowed.  While not usually a fence jumper, the Australian Cattle Dog can jump, so if you have low fences then perhaps a pen or run could be built for the dog for those times when he is left home alone. This breed must be socialised with other animals and people from an early age and throughout their life.",not available,not available,GROOMING The Australian Cattle Dog is very low maintenance and owners say they need very little brushing and can be bathed once in a while.,
Australian Kelpie,"APPEARANCE Since its inception, the Kelpie breed has developed into two distinct strains; the original Working Kelpie and the more recent class of ‘Bench Kelpie’ – a type specifically created for the show ring and more often seen as a pet rather than a working dog. Unlike the Bench Kelpie, the working dog is not bred for colour. The black and tan is regarded as the truest colour of the Working Kelpie breed, though it may also appear in red, blue or fawn, with or without tan. Working Kelpies are slightly smaller than the bench type, which stands up to 51cm at the withers (like the Australian Cattle Dog). The typical double coat has a short thick undercoat covered by a hard, straight rain-resistant outer coat. There is a definite ruff around the neck and mild breaching behind the legs.The Working Kelpie’s coat is also more coarse than the bench type. Kelpies are athletic with muscular shoulders and a strong hindquarter. The head is slightly rounded and broad between the eyes. Unlike the Bench Kelpie, the Working Kelpie is maintained in ‘working condition’, with a very trim, muscular physique devoid of unnecessary bulk or flab. For the full Breed Standard, please visit the ANKC website","TEMPERAMENT Working Kelpies are tireless and hardworking and their intelligence is apparent to anyone who sees them in action. The dog’s desire to work amongst sheep is instinctive. Young, untrained dogs can be seen naturally mimicking the actions of the more experienced dogs, working their actions out for themselves based purely on hereditary factors. Kelpies are a very loyal breed, and are regarded as a ‘one man dog’. When selecting a new dog, stockmen may initially look for a pup which is naturally drawn to them. The stockman can then rely on this bond to be strengthened as the dog matures, making it easier to train the animal. As the dog matures and is introduced to sheep, stockmen will look for those animals which show a ‘willingness to comply’: wanting to work for their boss, not just for themselves.","HEALTH AND LIFESPAN The Working Kelpie is a very sound breed with an average lifespan of 12-15 years. Breed selection is not only based on temperament and intelligence but also health and conformation, unlike show dogs, which are bred to conform to a written standard (often to the detriment of the overall health of the breed).",not available,not available,not available,not available,not available
Belgian Malinois,"APPEARANCE The Malinois has a short mahogany coat with black markings. It has black erect ears and a black muzzle. It has a square build in comparison to the German Shepherd . The other varieties of the Belgian Shepherd are distinguished by their coats and colours. The Tervueren is the same colour but has long hair; the Laekenois is fawn and lacks the black mask and ears, and the Groenendael has long hair and is solid black. Weight: Female 25-30 Kgs, Male 28-34 Kgs Height: Female 56-61 cm, Male 61-66 cm For the full breed standard, visit the ANKC website .","TEMPERAMENT The Belgian Shepherd is an intelligent and attentive breed, wary of strangers but not timid or aggressive. They are protective of their families, but if left alone can become introverted and even fear-biters. They are slow to mature mentally, and are not considered mature until they are three years old.","Belgian Malinois will live for 12 to 14 years. Hip dysplasia is not unknown in the breed, but Australian breeders have done much to decrease the instance of this problem.",not available,not available,not available,"Belgian Shepherds require daily brushing and combing, for at least a total of 30 minutes a week, with special attention to the undercoat during the shedding season. Excess hair should be removed from the inner ear and between the toes, and owners should watch for tangles in the ‘pantaloons’ and behind the ears.",

Cavalier King Charles Spaniel ,"Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Tri-colour With a sweet rounded face, big brown eyes and soft floppy ears the Cavalier is the ultimate “cute” dog. There are four colours, Blenheim (chestnut and white), Tri-colour (black, white and tan), black and tan, and ruby (solid red). Weight: 5.9 – 8.2 kg (Male or Female) Height: 31 – 33 cm (Male or Female) For the full breed standard visit the ANKC website","TEMPERAMENT Cavaliers are affectionate and compliant, tolerant of children and come highly recommended by many vets. This comfort-loving breed adores cuddling in laps but he also has more athletic instincts than you might think. Indeed, he can be a runner and chaser. A fenced backyard or a leash are musts at all times, because many Cavaliers have an instinct to chase most things that move including low-flying birds or even butterflies, vehicles on busy streets etc. and so most Cavaliers will never become ""street-wise"". Because the breed is so people-oriented, Cavaliers become stressed when left alone too long and are best suited to a home where someone is around. A Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who is lonely will whine or bark or chew destructively. Most Cavaliers are polite with everyone and peaceful with other dogs and cats. As they tend to regard all strangers as friends, members of the breed will usually not make good guard dogs. Cavaliers do need a decent amount of exercise - a couple of long daily walks and a fenced yard in which to run.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN Responsible breeders are screening parents to eliminate known genetic problems such as luxating patellas (slipping kneecaps), eye defects and congenital heart problems . Cavaliers can often suffer from, most notably Mitral Valve Disease , which leads to heart failure . It is both a congenital disease and is inherited in certain lines of Cavaliers. Syringomyelia (SM) is reported to be ""very widespread"" in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel breed. Syringomyelia is a disorder of the brain and spinal cord, which may cause severe head and neck pain and possible paralysis. The average lifespan of a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is between 9 and 14 years.",not available,not available,not available,GROOMING The Cavalier needs bathing and a good brush for 15-20 minutes each week. When coming out of winter hair may be shed onto furnishings. The drop ears should be wiped clean and checked regularly to avoid infections.,
Chihuahua,"APPEARANCE The Chihuahua is a lightly-built dog, tiny and fragile with a large rounded skull and big dark eyes. There are two types, the smooth-coated and long-coated. They are usually less than 20cm (8″) tall and weigh between 0.9-1.8kg (2-4lb). There are two forms: the smooth-coated which has a soft, short, close coat; and the long-coated which has a long, soft, flat or slightly curly coat with fringed ears, feathered feet and legs and a ruffle around the neck. Coat colours range from white through cream, sable, sand, blue to black. For the Long Coat Chihuahua  standard, visit this ANKC page For the Short Coat Chihuahua  standard, visit this ANKC page","TEMPERAMENT They can become very attached to their owners and reserved around strangers, and especially around children if not used to them. Chihuahuas tend to be high-strung and prone to nipping, snapping and even biting when frightened or threatened or when defending his people or territory. While primarily a companion dog, some owners call the Chihuahua a ‘pocket watchdog’ which can be noisy if visitors arrive. Many older people enjoy and encourage this early warning system. Some of these tendencies can be helped through early socialisation and training. Unfortunately, too many people with Chihuahuas allow them to become little tyrants, displaying manners that would not be acceptable in a larger dog. Chihuahuas have a reputation for being spoiled and untrainable, but that’s often because people don’t make an effort to train them. Chihuahuas are just like any other dog: they need consistent rules and structure if they are to learn effectively.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN Tiny dogs often come with big health problems, and the Chihuahua is no exception. Many Chihuahuas live long, healthy lives, but conditions seen in the breed include breathing difficulties caused by a windpipe that collapses in on itself. Luxating patellas are an orthopedic problem. The patella, or kneecap, of most very small dogs, including the Chihuahua, can very easily become displaced, causing pain and lameness. In mild cases the knee quickly slips back into place on its own, but severe cases must be corrected surgically. Ask your veterinarian to examine your dog's knees regularly, especially if you notice him limping or ""bunny hopping"" while running. Chihuahuas frequently have what's called a ""molera"" , or an open fontanelle, which is a soft area under the skin of the forehead where the bony plates of the skull have not fused together. It may eventually close up and become hard, but in some dogs, the molera never fully closes. While many dogs can live a normal lifespan with a molera, some may have a condition called hydrocephalus (fluid buildup in and around the brain), which can cause seizures and even death if not treated. The Chihuahua's round, protruding eyes are one of his most distinctive characteristics, but they are prone to a number of genetic eye disorders as well as to frequent injuries. Teeny-tiny Chihuahuas? They’re cute, but they are also fragile and more prone to medical problems like hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Most Chihuahuas live 12-14 years.",HOUSEPET POTENTIAL,not available,not available,"GROOMING Chihuahuas come in two coat types: smooth and long. Smooth Chihuahuas wear a velvety, shiny, close-fitting coat and have a ruff — an area of thicker, longer hair — around the neck. They have a scant covering of hair on the head and ears. The tail should be furry, not bare. Smooth Chihuahuas shed, but they are so small that the amount is manageable for all but the most house proud. Brush them weekly with a rubber grooming glove or soft bristle brush to remove dead hair and keep the skin and coat healthy. The long-coated Chihuahua is the product of a recessive gene, meaning a puppy must have the gene from both parents for the long coat to express itself, so he isn’t seen in litters as frequently as the smooth. The long, soft coat is flat or slightly curly, and the dog has a ruff around the neck, fringed ears, feathering on the legs and a plumed tail. The hair on the rest of the body is almost as smooth as that on the smooth Chihuahua. Long-coated Chihuahuas are beautiful, and they’re easy to groom, but they do shed seasonally. Brush the longcoat with a soft bristle brush once or twice a week. Use a stainless steel comb to remove tangles from the hair on the ears, legs and tail. If you brush the Chihuahua faithfully, he shouldn’t need frequent baths. If he spends a lot of time on your furniture or in your bed, though, there’s nothing wrong with bathing him as often as a couple of times a week. Use a gentle shampoo made for dogs and dry him thoroughly so he doesn’t get chilled. Never let him sit around and air dry. Keep your Chihuahua’s big ears clean with a solution recommended by your veterinarian. Don’t use cotton swabs inside the ear; they can push gunk further down into it. Wipe out the ear with a cotton ball, never going deeper than the first knuckle of your finger. Trim his nails regularly, usually every couple of weeks. They should never be so long that you hear them clicking on the floor.",not available
Dachshund,"APPEARANCE There are two sizes: the Standard, which is 25-28cm (10-11″) and the Miniature which is 20cm (8″). Their lungs are large for a dog this size and they have a barrel-like chest. The Dachshund's unusually large and paddle-shaped paws were perfect for efficient digging. There are three coat varieties: the smooth, the long, and the wire, which when combined with the two sizes accommodates the six different types. There is a wide range of colours available in either solids, or lesser-known dapples (also called merles). Weight : 9 kg-12 kg. For a Miniature, the ideal weight is 4.5kg (10 lbs). For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website","Dachshunds are extremely sociable dogs and are not suitable for being left alone all day.  They want to be with you and your family as much as possible and also like to be on your lap or having cuddles on the couch, so if you want a dog for the backyard a Dachshund is not for you. They are just as happy playing and being taken for a walk or car ride, which they love, as they are cuddled up to you on the sofa.  Some Dachshunds have been described by their owners as couch potatoes, but it is important that they are exercised regularly to keep their weight down and also to prevent boredom and destructiveness. Dachshunds have a mind of their own, can be stubborn, obstinate,  have selective hearing and if you let them, they will rule the household. They are not hard to housetrain with the right training, but it can be said that this breed doesn’t enjoy getting wet, and there is certainly a consensus of opinion that when it rains they will not willingly go out in the garden to answer calls of nature! Dachshunds will bark and are territorial.  If a stranger comes to the door they’ll bark, if the doorbell rings they’ll bark,  if they can see someone walking past their house, they’ll bark, a bird flying into the garden, they’ll bark. Whatever they can see belongs to them.  Not all Dachshunds display this behaviour but you need to be aware of it. Dachshunds were originally bred to hunt badgers and some of them can have high prey drives, meaning the chooks will not be safe!   You may think your Dachshund has excellent recall off leash but if they see something interesting they will be off in a second following their instincts and will not come back until they’re ready.  This often leads to tragic consequences.   Dachshunds are better off being walked on the leash, especially in areas where there are cars as they do not have any road sense. Not all Dachshunds like big dogs and they have no idea of their size in relation to other dogs. They will happily take on a bigger dog to protect you or their territory, sometimes with tragic consequences.","HEALTH The extreme short legs of the Dachshund are caused by a dominant gene which produces a condition known as Chondrodysplasia ; this is where the cartilage of the growth plates grows at a slow rate and can weaken the backbone. This means the long spine might be vulnerable to back problems especially if the dog is obese , frequently uses stairs or is allowed to jump down from chairs or lounges. Intervertebral disk disease is a major clinical problem in the breed. However, by recognising the causes and consequences of the problem, owners may prevent a great deal of difficulties by restricting the amount of excessive jumping and managing the weight of their dogs. Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) is a term for retinal degenerations occurring in many breeds of dogs. The disease results in a degeneration of the light-sensitive membrane at the back of the eye – the retina – resulting in loss of vision, and often leading to blindness. PRA has been diagnosed in all varieties of Dachshunds but there has been a predominant incidence in the mini long-haired variety.",not available,not available,not available,"GROOMING Dachshunds are a low-maintenance breed. They shed, but not excessively. Smooths can be wiped with a damp cloth between baths to keep them clean. If you live in a location that is cold in the winter, your Smooth Dachshund may need a sweater when he goes outside. Wirehaired Dachshund Wirehaired Dachshunds require regular brushing, and they'll need to have their coats ""stripped"" two to three times a year to look their best. Longhaired Dachshunds should be brushed regularly to remove knots and burrs and prevent mats from forming. They need to be bathed more often than the Smooth Dachshund, and you must blow-dry them afterward for their coat to look good. Special attention should be given to the areas under the ears and between the pads of the feet.",
Dalmatian,"APPEARANCE The breed as we know it today has physical characteristics similar to both pointers and hounds, however the Dalmatian is used neither for scent work nor as a gun dog. Its primary use, both historically and currently, is as companion and guard dog . Much like the Pharaoh Hound, Greyhound and Whippet , the coat is short, dense, and fine. The balanced, strong and muscular physique, without bulk or coarseness, is also very much like that of the gundogs – the Pointer, Weimaraner or the German Shorthaired Pointer. The main characteristic which defines the Dalmatian is its spots. Born with white hair and small pigmented spots in the skin, the coloured spots develop at around two to three weeks and the nose will darken at about three months of age. The spots continue to form with age usually up to two or three months, developing into either black or brown, called liver. The spots should be round, clearly defined and not overlapping. Height: Males: 58-61cm; Females: 56-58cm Weight: 23-28kg. Females are invariably at the smaller end of the scale. For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC page","TEMPERAMENT Well-bred Dalmatians are loyal and loving companions and are eager to please their owners. They make excellent watchdogs. Although not yappy, they will however alert their owner if something is amiss. They are powerful, active and boisterous dogs that do need discipline. You can expect young pups to dig holes in the yard and chew up your plants too. At least until the dog has matured and learned some obedience. With an average working dog intelligence, the Dalmatian will enjoy obedience training and excels at agility classes. Dalmatians have a stable, outgoing nature which suits an active family. EXERCISE Most Dalmatians find an average to large backyard adequate, but they are a breed of great physical endurance, able to travel at a moderate pace for great lengths of time. A morning and evening walk is recommended to burn off energy and stimulate the dog’s mental wellbeing. Breeders warn Dalmatians have little road sense and need a well fenced backyard.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN A Dalmatian’s white coat and pale pigmentation will contribute to the likelihood of sunburn . The most susceptible areas, the nose, ears and eye-rims, will be less inclined to burn where more pigment is present. A metabolic defect unique to the Dalmatian breed can lead to liver and subsequent bladder problems , resulting in bladder stones. This is a hereditary disease and is best avoided by purchasing from breeders whose dogs do not possess the condition. Encouraging your dog to drink plenty of water will minimise the effects of the disease. In past veterinary journals, deafness was reported in up to 30% of the breed. Breeders say this figure is not representative of Australian lines. Deafness will usually show up in puppies by about four weeks of age. People considering buying a Dalmatian puppy should deal with a reputable breeder and always have the dog’s hearing checked. Another reported problem is allergies which may result in skin lesions. Paspalum grass is one known cause of these allergies. Dalmatians live for between 12-14 years.",not available,not available,not available,"GROOMING While they do not have a strong doggy odour, a fortnightly bath is adequate. When a Dalmatian sheds, the white hair is very noticeable and daily wiping with a rubber glove will remove most loose hairs.",
Dobermann,"The Dobermann is a medium to large, deep-chested dog breed with a sleek and sturdy appearance. The breed is muscular and athletic, possessing great strength and endurance. Dobermanns have traditionally had their tails docked (removed) soon after birth and, later, their ears cropped (trimmed surgically in order to make them stand erect). Much controversy has surrounded the practice of ear cropping and tail docking in dogs and Australia has thankfully outlawed both practices. Yet, 95% of images we found on the Internet proudly depict Dobermans that have been ""mutilated"" so clearly there's a long way to go before this is no longer considered a desirable look by owners especially in the show ring. Dobermanns come in four colours, black, brown, blue and fawn all with rust tan markings (sometimes small patches of white are seen). Weight: Males 40-45kg; Females 32-65kg Height: Males 68-72cm; Females 63-68cm For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website .","The Dobermnan is known to be energetic, watchful, fearless and obedient. A lthough considered to be working dogs, Dobermanns are often stereotyped as being ferocious and aggressive . As a personal protection dog, the Dobermann was originally bred for these traits: it had to be large and intimidating, fearless, and willing to defend its owner, but sufficiently obedient and restrained to only do so on command. These traits served the dog well in its role as a personal defense dog, police dog, or war dog, but were not ideally adapted to a companionship role. The Dobermann's aggression has been toned down by modern breeders over the years , and today's Dobermanns are known for a much more even and good natured temperament, extreme loyalty, high intelligence, and great trainability. For instance, Psychologist Stanley Coren ranks the Dobermann as the 5th most intelligent dog in the category of obedience command training, based on the selective surveys he performed (as documented in his book The Intelligence of Dogs ). HEALTH & LIFESPAN One of the most negative characteristics of the Dobermann is their short life span rarely living past 10 years. This can sometimes make them unsuitable for those who find losing a pet extremely traumatic. There are several genetic problems which can be clearly identified at an early age through mandatory health testing requirements and detection. 1. Von Willebrands factor – a form of haemophilia that can be detected by a DNA test 2. Hip Dysplasia – this can lay dormant in some dogs and X-rays must be presented and cleared 3. Eye problems – Ectopic and Entopic problems must not be detected by a animal opthamologist Although the National Dobermann Council has standard temperament tests, the Qld club makes these tests compulsory for their members. The tests are conducted by the club to weed out shy and nervous dogs who do not respond well to unfamiliar stimuli. Any aggression, shyness, or “stand offishness” is seen as incorrect behaviour for a companion breed. Dogs who fail the temperament tests may be deemed unsuitable for breeding. The following Dobermann problems are not clearly detectable until symptoms present themselves, at which stage the dog is struck from the breeding register. 4. “Wobblers” – a skeletal problem in which vertebrae fuse, the symptoms mimic hip dysplasia 5. Hypothyroidism – thinning of the hair along the flanks and sluggish personality 6. Diluted Alopecia – a recessive gene occurs in colour variations of blue and fawn and causes hair to fall out permanently 7. Heart Problems – recommended to have regularly heart checks and ultrasounds and an ECG once every two years.",not available,not available,not available,not available,"The Dobermann has a short, smooth hair coat that requires very little grooming .",
French Bulldog or Frenchie,"APPEARANCE French Bulldogs are a small, stocky dog with a roach (arched) back and compact appearance. The face of the ‘Frenchie’ is flattened although said to be less so than the British Bulldog. The biggest difference between the British Bulldog and the French Bulldog is the Frenchie’s bat ears which stand stiffly upright with the edges curved slightly forward. They are held erect by cartilage which begins to stiffen at 10 days of age. A short undocked tail is another essential feature of the breed. Colours include brindle, fawn, and pied (mostly white). Height: 30cm Weight: Males 12.5kg; Females 11kg For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website .","TEMPERAMENT Owners say the French Bulldog is intelligent, vivacious, deeply affectionate and clownish. They are said to be very reliable with children and good watchdogs. Most breeders say they are not yappy dogs and will usually only bark for good reason. This robust little dog will stand its ground if confronted by unfamiliar people.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN Not all Frenchies will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed. Among those to watch out for is a weakness in the back which can be aggravated by the dog jumping down from furniture, particularly when young. Other potential problems with the breed include luxating patellas (dislocating knee joints) which gives the dog a bowlegged appearance. Some lines suffer from elongated soft palate (extension of the roof of the mouth) problems with signs of respiratory distress, very noisy breathing, decreased exercise tolerance and heavy snoring, all common symptoms. Treatment of affected dogs usually involves removing part of the soft palate, allowing a freer passage of air into the lungs. French Bulldogs are very susceptible to overheating and must have shelter and fresh water available at all times. They can experience serious breathing difficulties in hot weather. There is a great variation in the reported lifespan of French Bulldogs but the average lifespan of a French Bulldog is 12 to 16 years if they are well looked after.","HOUSEPET POTENTIAL French Bulldogs have been bred as a house/lap dog. They are said to make good house pets, being compact in size, having a quiet demeanour and shedding only small amounts of hair.",not available,not available,"GROOMING Breeders report that minimal grooming is required. Although the coat rarely sheds, a soft brush or mitten brush will remove loose hairs when moulting.",
Finnish Lapphund,"The Finnish Lapphunds are a medium-sized “Spitz” type dog and range in size from 41cm to 52cm at the withers. They appear strongly built, an impression accentuated by their abundant, thick coat. Photo by MG Studios featuring L-R: Ryker from Theldaroy Kennels, Veikko or 'Squiggle' of Armahani Kennels, Ahsoka of Magpielane Kennels and Alleria or 'Wookie' from Caleebra Kennels. They come in  almost all colours though the most common is black with tan points. They also come in cream, solid black, brown as well as intricate patterns such as domino, wolf sable (agouti) and red sable. White markings  on the chest and feet are common, and more occasionally on the face and neck. For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website PERSONALITY Happy and affectionate , the Finnish Lapphund is naturally drawn to people. It is probably one of the most intelligent canine breeds around. Finnish Lapphunds are quick learners and easy to train and they also think before they act. Being a herding animal, tend to look at their owners as a flock that needs to be tended! Some can be barkers, particularly when stimulated by play or something exciting and this needs to be managed  through appropriate training. Finnish Lapphund Asta with Karri - Photo Credit: Finnish Lapphund Club of NSW Whilst you should always supervise children around dogs, the Finnish Lapphund gentle and laid back temperament makes it an excellent choice for homes with children. They also make excellent therapy dogs. EXERCISE NEEDS Though the Finnish Lapphund can adapt to living in an environment with limited space, they still need to be exercised regularly. Finnish Lapphunds should have at least 30 minutes of activity each day. A number of Finnish Lapphunds are active participants in a range of dog sports such as agility , herding , tracking, flyball , rally-o, endurance, dog sledding and even dancing! Finnish Lapphunds Nuppu & Mod - Photo Credit: Finnish Lapphund Club of NSW LIVING CONDITIONS The Finnish Lapphund does not have very special living needs. Despite having been bred to help herd reindeer, the Lapphund can be kept inside apartments or homes with limited space. The Lapphund is known to be able to adapt itself to different environments and circumstances. GROOMING REQUIREMENTS Male Finnish Lapphunds are known to have an abundant “lion-like” mane however one the best aspects of the breed is the low maintenance required for grooming. The coat’s double layers means that it is more “wash and wear” and is not prone to tangles or knotting like other long-haired dog breeds. A simple half hour of brushing once a week will usually be enough. Lappies will ‘drop’ their coats once or twice a year. HEALTH ISSUES Finnish Lapphund puppy (8 weeks) - Photo Credit: Finnish Lapphund Club of NSW The Finnish Lapphund is one of the healthiest canine breeds with an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years. There have been very few reports of Lapphunds afflicted with Progressive Retinal Atroph y (PRA) or Canine Hip Dysplasia . RECOMMENDED FOR Although considered a working breed, the Finnish Lapphunds do not require the same amount of exercise. Photo by MG Studios : Puppy Fenix (Caleebra Kennels) Whilst regular walks and mental stimulation are essential, they can be ‘couch potatoes’ during their rest times. They do need however to be part of the life of their owner and should not be an “outside only” dog so if you’re planning to be away at work for 10-11 hours each day, this is not the dog for you. A bored dog can be destructive and it is essential to start training early to ensure you end up with a happy, well-adjusted and obedient dog.

There have been very few reports of Lapphunds afflicted with Progressive Retinal Atroph y (PRA) or Canine Hip Dysplasia . RECOMMENDED FOR Although considered a working breed, the Finnish Lapphunds do not require the same amount of exercise. Photo by MG Studios : Puppy Fenix (Caleebra Kennels) Whilst regular walks and mental stimulation are essential, they can be ‘couch potatoes’ during their rest times. They do need however to be part of the life of their owner and should not be an “outside only” dog so if you’re planning to be away at work for 10-11 hours each day, this is not the dog for you. A bored dog can be destructive and it is essential to start training early to ensure you end up with a happy, well-adjusted and obedient dog.

The coat’s double layers means that it is more “wash and wear” and is not prone to tangles or knotting like other long-haired dog breeds. A simple half hour of brushing once a week will usually be enough. Lappies will ‘drop’ their coats once or twice a year. HEALTH ISSUES Finnish Lapphund puppy (8 weeks) - Photo Credit: Finnish Lapphund Club of NSW The Finnish Lapphund is one of the healthiest canine breeds with an average lifespan of 12 to 14 years. There have been very few reports of Lapphunds afflicted with Progressive Retinal Atroph y (PRA) or Canine Hip Dysplasia . RECOMMENDED FOR Although considered a working breed, the Finnish Lapphunds do not require the same amount of exercise. Photo by MG Studios : Puppy Fenix (Caleebra Kennels) Whilst regular walks and mental stimulation are essential, they can be ‘couch potatoes’ during their rest times. They do need however to be part of the life of their owner and should not be an “outside only” dog so if you’re planning to be away at work for 10-11 hours each day, this is not the dog for you. A bored dog can be destructive and it is essential to start training early to ensure you end up with a happy, well-adjusted and obedient dog.

German Shepherd,"The true colour of a German Shepherd is not known until the puppy coat is shed and the full adult coat has grown. However the German Shepherd Dog’s coat is generally a mixture of black, fawn and gold. Pure black German Shepherds are also available, but white is considered undesirable in show ring dogs. Weight: Males 30-40 kg; Females 22 – 32 kg Height: Males 60-65 cm; Females 55 – 60 cm For the full breed standard, visit the ANKC website .","German Shepherd Dogs have suffered an image problem which was in part deserved. Many years ago there were significant problems in the breed with temperament. Today however, as a result of the work done by the German Shepherd Dog Council of Australia , the temperament of these dogs is excellent. The German Shepherd personality is aloof but not usually aggressive. He's a reserved dog; he doesn't make friends immediately, but once he does, he's extremely loyal. With his family he's easy-going and approachable, but when threatened he can be strong and protective, making him an excellent watchdog. German Shepherds bred by breeders, members of German Shepherd Clubs affiliated with the German Shepherd Dog Council of Australia , are loyal, loving and intelligent dogs who are willing to do anything for the people they love to the point of giving their own lives. Although the dogs are good with children, they should not be left alone with small children because both dogs and puppies can be boisterous. German Shepherds are used in police work, including tracking and searching for guns and drugs. They are excellent at obedience work, make good companions, guide dogs and guard dogs. The dogs can also be involved in schutzhund, a sport where dogs attack on command.","German Shepherd Dogs can be prone to health problems including hip and elbow dysplasia . In Australia, the German Shepherd Dog Council of Australia introduced and controls a number of Breed Improvement Schemes that are designed to reduce the incidence of diseases with a possible genetic link, by selecting for breeding only those animals which pass stringent selection tests. The A-stamp Certificate system was designed to reduce the incidence of hip dysplasia , a crippling disease of the hind legs. A similar certificate system (Z-stamp) exists for elbow dysplasia . People buying puppies should ensure they view both A and Z certificates to ensure parents have been breed surveyed. The pups are breed surveyed through the local German Shepherd Clubs and the paperwork is issued by the Council. German Shepherds can also suffer from a variety of skin allergies - such as dermatitis or Hot Spots - which can be caused by flea bites , food allergies or allergens.","German Shepherds isn't the breed for you if you're away from home frequently or for long periods of time. When left alone they can become anxious or bored , and are likely to express their worry in ways you don't like: barking , chewing or digging . German Shepherds can be aloof and suspicious of strangers. To raise a social and well-behaved dog, expose your puppy to many experiences, places, and people. Obedience training, starting with puppy classes, is essential for getting him used to other people and dogs, as well as teaching him basic canine manners.",not available,not available,"The German Shepherd needs little grooming, however, during the seasonal change from winter to summer it is often necessary to strip out the dead, woolly coat. This should be done as quickly as possible with a rubber brush specifically designed for the job.",not available
Great Dane,"APPEARANCE One of the largest dog breeds in the world, the Great Dane can reach a minimum of 76cm (30"") at the shoulder and weigh upwards from 54kg (120lb). This is a tall dog with a moderately deep chest and a square appearance. The head is rectangular in shape with ears which are large, triangular and floppy. Harlequin Great Dane There are six recognised colours - Fawn, Brindle, Black, Blue, Mantle and Harlequin . Great Danes with colours or markings besides these six cannot be shown but regardless of colour, they all can make fine family pets. Be cautious of those breeders trying to sell you a 'rare' colour. The Great Dane grows into a massive dog which should be considered before purchasing the breed. A Great Dane can grow well over 6 foot in height, when stood on their hind legs, so he is capable of peering over any garden fence. Prospective owners also need to think about fitting both the dog and the family in the car, how much room there is for the dog to lay on the lounge room floor when the children want to play. Consider that a Great Dane will ‘counter-surf’ the kitchen with ease and a Great Dane dog door is big enough for an adult to get through... Height: Female: 71–81 cm, Male: 76–86 cm Weight: Female: 45–59 kg, Male: 54–90 kg For the full breed standard, visit the ANKC website","TEMPERAMENT Great Danes are territorial and most will bark at strangers on their property, but once introduced, are friendly and affectionate. Owners say they are loving and loyal, and adore human company. Despite their size, Great Danes have a sensitive nature and this can easily lead to anxiety issues if they are not given clear boundaries early on.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN Bone strength is vital for giant breeds such as Great Danes. Start with a balanced diet as puppies and stick to the diet sheet provided by the breeder. Danes do have a slower metabolism than most other breeds and even other giant breeds so the accepted practice is to stay with a food that fits the 23%-25% protein range, feeding a well-balanced diet, which generally consists of a premium adult dry dog food mixed with raw mince. Just bear in mind that a growing puppy can eat up to 8 cups of dry food a day . Carrying excess weight adds stress to bones and joints and particularly impacts as they grow old. An obese or even a chubby Great Dane is not a healthy one. Great Danes may be predisposed to certain health problems such as: Hip and Elbow Dysplasia Von Willibrands Disease Wobbler Syndrome Eye/hearing abnormalities (especially in predominately white dogs) Sports and/or weight injuries like cruciate ligament tears Thyroid abnormalities Irritable Bowel Syndrome Cardiomyopathy and other heart conditions Puppies and young adults can develop growing or bone problems which are sometimes associated with an improper diet. The most negative aspect of the breed is a short life span. Deal only with a reputable breeder and make sure you see certificates with low-risk ratings for hip and elbow dysplasia , both inheritable defects causing degeneration of the hip or elbow. Being a deep-chested breed, Great Danes are vulnerable to bloat or stomach torsion and it is recommended to feed your dog smaller portions several times a day. Also don’t exercise him immediately after eating or drinking. Cancers are now part of the world of canines across many breeds and they are more readily diagnosed and can be treated. Great Danes do have a slightly higher prevalence to cancers compared to some dogs and Osteosarcoma, especially in a limb, can be a huge hurdle to overcome. You should consider whether you could care for a Dane with an amputation or nurse one through surgery and/or chemotherapy.","HOUSEPET POTENTIAL If  you have the room, Great Danes are good indoors, with little hair shed and usually content to stretch out on the floor or lounge as they love lying at (or on) the feet of their owners. A Great Dane can live as an outside dog but cannot be people deprived. They will seek the company of their humans and if it is not available, may show signs of anxiety or destructive behaviour. A naughty Great Dane doesn’t chew the chair leg, it chews the table! They do require more food than a Labrador sized dog, vet bills and medications will also cost more as this is a giant breed. If you decide to bring a Great Dane into your home you will need to be realistic of the costs that can be involved in caring for him.

Hungarian Vizsla,"APPEARANCE Photo credit: Hubertus Vizslas Australia The Hungarian Vizsla is a slim, sleek, sophisticated-looking dog with a sensitive expression and thin, silky, drop ears . He has a short russet gold coat and the eyes and nose come in various shades of brown. Although sometimes described as medium-sized, most dog owners would consider the Hungarian Vizsla belongs to the large breed category. Height: Male: 56–64 cm; Female: 53–61 cm Weight: Male: 20–29 kg; Female: 18–25 kg For the full breed standard, visit the ANKC website","TEMPERAMENT Lively, friendly, even tempered and easily trained.  The Hungarian Vizsla has an outstanding willingness to keep contact with his master while working and it is one of his essential qualities. The good-natured Hungarian Vizsla has even been called the ""Velcro Vizsla""  because he is so tactile - he likes to attach himself to people, preferably in their laps or on their heads! The breed ranks low on aggression , destructiveness and snappiness, and high on playfulness. If you're interested in dog sports, your Hungarian Vizsla would probably be happy to compete. The Vizsla excels in conformation, field, obedience and agility . His superb scenting skills make him a natural hunter. Hungarian Vizslas have also been guide dogs, drug detection dogs, therapy dogs, and search and rescue dogs, and have competed in falconry, flyball , tracking, and hunt tests. Hungarian Vizslas are talkers: they will whine, moan, or make other noises to let you know their opinion on everything that's going on. Some can become recreational barkers if this bad habit isn't controlled early on. Being a retrieving dog, the Vizsla is mouthy and likes to chew. Provide him with a variety of chew toys and rotate them regularly so he doesn't get bored and decide to gnaw on your shoes or other expensive items.","In Australia, Hip Dysplasia - a degenerative disease of the hips - cases in Hungarian Vizslas have been reported though the incidence has been low. If you're buying your puppy from a reputable breeder, please ensure the parents have been x-rayed and have good hips before buying their pups. The average lifespan is 12-14 years.","HOUSEPET POTENTIAL Hungarian Vizslas love being indoors and, due to their thin coats, feel the cold in winter. Most quickly learn to be neat and quiet, although puppies can be a danger to your fragile ornaments!",not available,not available,"This smooth, shorthaired coat is easy to keep in peak condition.

Jack Russell Terrier,"APPEARANCE The Jack Russell Terriers are ostensibly different - slightly longer - to the Parson Russell Terriers who are taller and square. Ideally the Jack Russell stands between 25-30cm (10-12″) in height, a bit taller than a Maltese , and is slightly longer than it is tall. Although narrow, the chest is deep though the shortened legs should still allow for plenty of clearance. The eyes will appear alert, the jaws deep, wide and powerful and the coat is predominantly white with black, tan or brown markings. Today's Jack Russells are characterised by two-tone or tri-colour patterns of white, brown, and sometimes black. The Jack Russell Terrier comes in three coat varieties - smooth, rough and broken, and all require a minimum of grooming. Modern day Jack Russells are much more sturdy and muscled than their ancestors. Weight: 6 – 8 kg Height: 25 – 30 cm For the full breed standard, visit the ANKC website .","TEMPERAMENT The Jack Russell Terrier is a happy, energetic dog with a strong desire to work. This breed is most happy when given companionship and a job to do. Digging is normal for a Jack Russell, especially if he decides it is his job to free your yard from rodents! Hunting ability is bred into them; it is their nature. The desire to hunt combined with a high energy level makes training a must for the Jack Russell. You will never win a battle of wills with him! Early socialisation is one of the most important things you can do for your Jack Russell puppy. Introducing him to the world in a controlled environment is key to raising a well-behaved, happy and friendly dog. Socialising is familiarisation of your puppy with different people, children, other dogs, animals and getting them used to all kinds of environments, sounds, smells and situations. Although bold and fearless, the Jack Russell Terrier should remain a friendly and playful dog with children and their owners. An untrained Jack Russell may grow to be a nippy dog and any bored dog is likely to be destructive. Because of his origins, Jack Russells can be vocal and they also make good watchdogs. The breed’s fearless character can manifest itself when confronted with other dogs and any animal that resembles prey, including cats, hamsters etc.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN The Jack Russell is a hardy breed with few health and genetic problems. Some are prone to dislocation of the kneecaps, inherited eye diseases, deafness and Legg Perthes —a disease of the hip joints of small dog breeds. Most other health issues relate to injuries caused by the dog’s fearless and spirited nature. This is a strong, healthy breed with an expected long lifespan, about 14-15 years.",not available,not available,not available,GROOMING The Jack Russell is a medium maintenance dog with all type of coats requiring some grooming. Smooth coat Jack Russells actually require more brushing (weekly) whereas the rough and broken coats will only need to be stripped every four weeks.,
Maltese,"APPEARANCE This elegant dog breed is famous for the long silky white coat covering his body. Straight and thick, the coat falls all the way to the floor. Many years ago, Maltese came in many colours, but these days they are always white. But the Maltese is more than his coat. Completing the picture is a slightly rounded skull, shiny black nose, hanging ears, dark brown eyes surrounded by black eye rims and short straight legs. Maltese carry their heads high on their long necks, and their plumed tails carry over their backs. This gives them a distinguished, aristocratic look. Height: up to 25 cm for both males and females Weight: there's no restriction for conformation but a healthy weight range for an adult dog is 3-4kg. For the full breed standard, visit the ANKC website .","TEMPERAMENT Even though the Maltese are very small dogs, they tend to be brave and without fear. They are generally sweet tempered and owners will find their Maltese constantly by their side, whether they are working around the house or relaxing in bed. Maltese as one of the toy breeds don’t require a great deal of space which makes them ideal for those who have small backyards or live in apartments. Because they have a long history as companion dogs, Maltese require a lot of human attention and suffer from separation anxiety . If left alone for hours each day, they can bark and become destructive. No breed is perfect, and Maltese sometimes are intolerant of small children or other dogs, especially if they have been overly pampered by their people. If this occurs, they can become very protective, barking and even biting if animals or people are perceived as a threat to their relationship with their beloved human family. Maltese are not a good choice for families with small children, however, because they are so small and can be easily injured. Like all dogs, they must be taught their place in your home, and require early socialisation and basic obedience training. They are also notoriously hard to housetrain and some like to jump in puddles.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN As a rule of thumb, wait until your Maltese puppy is 8 months old to walk very far with him, because his bones are still developing. As with many other toy breeds the most common health issue relates to the leg joints. Patellar luxation (locking of the kneecaps), is not entirely uncommon and can progress to cause more serious osteoarthritis . This condition can usually be addressed with surgery. When purchasing your puppy, have a vet check it over thoroughly. The vet will check the leg joints and as a matter of routine will also check the heart for congenital heart murmur . Maltese are prone to gingivitis and need a diet that includes chewy food. Maltese will live to 14-15 years but it is not uncommon for them to reach 18 if kept out of the damp.",not available,not available,not available,"GROOMING Because he doesn't have an undercoat, the Maltese sheds little, and many people consider the breed to be hypoallergenic. But be warned, Maltese are one of the highest maintenance dogs. Keep the coat well out of the eyes otherwise constant tearing will cause a painful dermatitis. If neglected, the coat will also cause serious health problems such as skin infections, pain and restricted movement. If you’re not up to grooming daily, the coat can be clipped right back, about an inch long, ensuring that the dog stays warm. Even a clipped dog will need regular grooming. Unless bathed weekly and groomed daily, the Maltese long luxurious coat will mat, especially when the puppy coat is replaced by adult hair.",
Poodle,"The toy and miniature types are by far the most popular of the three types today. Toys stand under 28cm, similar in height to a Maltese ; whilst the Miniature may be about 10cm taller, like a Fox Terrier. The Standard Poodle is a medium to large-sized dog, standing well over its smaller cousins. The Poodle can be any one of many solid colours including blues, creams, whites, apricots, reds, silvers, blacks, browns. Any Poodle that is not a solid colour at maturity (2 years) is said to be ""mismarked"" and this may indicate it is not a purebred Poodle. Both grey and silver Poodles are actually born black and they will gradually fade to grey over a 2-year period. It is the Poodle’s coat that sets it apart from many other breeds. Thick, curly and dense, it has a woolly appearance rather than furry and doesn’t shed. If left unclipped, which is not recommended, this woolly coat would normally conceal the dog’s fine-boned form. Slender built with sharp, well defined features, the poodle’s frame used to be shown off with those elaborate clipping styles which once associated the breed with the well-to-do. These clips are now really only commonly seen in the show ring. For the full breed standards, please visit the ANKC website .","A well-bred Poodle is highly intelligent and usually very co-operative. It is easily trained using toys and training rewards to make the process fun. Its empathetic nature and joy in engaging with people makes him a natural for visiting people in nursing homes, hospitals, and schools and Poodles make wonderful therapy dogs. Poodles are active dogs, but the smaller dogs need less room and less exercise. Toy and Miniature Poodles are often the companions of people who are less active and can be extremely happy as lap dogs and TV-watching buddies. Despite their playful attitude, poodles are regarded as the second most intelligent of dog breeds (after the Border Collie ). They love human companionship and will often form close bonds with one member of the family, usually the provider. This can produce a loyal and easily trained companion, equally ideal for those living alone or with a family. However, an intelligent dog is an easily spoilt dog, and a spoilt poodle can be a force to be reckoned with. The breed should simply not be over-pampered and must be treated with an even-handed approach, maintaining a reasonable level of discipline and common sense. Of the three varieties, this is perhaps more so with the Toy, which due to its small stature, is prone to developing a nervous and unpredictable manner if handled roughly or antagonised, a problem most often seen when in a family with small or boisterous children.  Whilst Poodles make excellent watchdogs and will naturally alert you when strangers arrive at your home, they should quickly become calm and accepting if and when you tell them to be. Obedience training, at least to a level so that the dog understands essential basic commands, is recommended. Standard Poodle Roxy heeling - Photo credit: Linda Johnson, Giday Poodles Breeders generally agree that the Standard is the most stable of the three, though requires the most exercise. The Miniature is most common among families.","HEALTH AND LIFESPAN The Poodle is a fairly healthy breed but may still suffer from some various conditions which are common with many breeds of similar size. The process of miniaturisation can lead to problems of overcrowding of the teeth in the toy variety. Both Toy Poodles and Miniature Poodles may suffer from luxating patella - where the kneecap moves out of its natural position. This condition can be corrected surgically and the likelihood of its incidence can be determined by a veterinarian. Eye disorders, such as Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA) are known to occur amongst the breed, but can, and should, be tested for by breeders prior to breeding. Hip Dysplasia , a chronic condition affecting the hip joints, is also evident in the Standard Poodle. A responsible breeder would not use animals affected by these conditions, so be satisfied you are purchasing from a reputable breeder. The deep chest of the Standard Poodle may predispose it to bloat – a gastrointestinal condition associated with overfeeding or feeding at inappropriate times. New owners should consult with breeders to discuss dietary requirements. Healthy, well-maintained poodles will live a long life, around 15 years.",not available,not available,not available,"GROOMING If you’re after a low maintenance dog which requires little grooming, don’t choose a poodle. The fine, curly coat that worked well when the Poodle spent his time in the water needs to be clipped regularly, typically about every 5 to 6 weeks, depending on his owner’s preferences. If allowed to grow long, the coat will mat and it requires regular brushing at home, even with professional grooming. Those elaborate clips displayed on show dogs are not essential, and a simple ‘lamb clip’ is all that is required. Owners can learn to clip their dogs, however a professional clipper is recommended for the first year, until the dog becomes accustomed to the practice. Clipping will cost around $30 to $100, depending on the size of the animal and the establishment. This regular cost should be considered before purchasing the dog. Dental care is important, particularly for Toy and Miniature Poodles. Keep on top of it by brushing teeth with a dog toothpaste and having a veterinarian do regular dental checks. Any long-eared breed with a large covering of hair is also prone to a build-up of wax and grime in the ear canal, which may result in infections if not cleaned regularly. Trim the nails as needed, usually every week or two. They shouldn’t get so long that you can hear them clicking on the floor.",
Rottweiler or Rottie,"APPEARANCE The Rottweiler is a large dog, slightly longer than it is tall with a large frame balanced by a deep, broad chest and heavy muscling. Rotties are always black with clearly delineated rust or mahogany markings over the eyes, on the side of the muzzle, and on throat, chest, and lower legs. Traditionally tail docking was performed when the puppies were newly born within days but this practice has now thankfully been outlawed in Australia. The Rottie coat is smooth and short with an undercoat present on the neck and thighs. Wavy or curly coats are faulted and long coats are disqualifications for breeding and the show ring. The Rottweiler in motion is a picture of power and stamina with strong reach in front and forceful drive in the rear. A well-conditioned Rottie is a superb athlete. Height: Males 61-68cm; Females 56-63cm Weight: 42-50 Kg For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website .","TEMPERAMENT It is in breed temperament that the Rottie is often misjudged. A well-bred Rottweiler is calm, confident, and courageous with an inherent aloofness towards strangers and a reserved attitude in new situations. Combined with his fierce devotion to home and family, these characteristics can be subverted from their original purpose by poor breeding practices, lack of socialisation, and failure to teach basic good manners. Rottweilers are territorial and will not permit strangers onto their property or in their home unless their owner welcomes the person. Some Rottweilers will not even let people they know into the house if the owner isn’t there, which can be a problem if you need to have a pet sitter or some other person come in while you are gone. If the dog does not accept examination by the owner or by anyone chosen by the owner, such as a veterinarian, without either shrinking away or becoming aggressive, the dog does not exhibit acceptable Rottweiler character. Rottweiler owners without a strong grasp of the breed’s nature can find themselves in trouble if the dog has been badly bred or assumes leadership of the family.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN Rottweilers are one of the breeds most affected by Hip Dysplasia , a genetic deformity in which the head of the femur doesn’t fit properly into the hip socket. This condition can range from mild to severe. Severe cases are extremely painful and often require surgery to correct. Even with the surgery, the dog is likely to develop arthritis as he ages. Elbow Dysplasia and osteochondrosis (OCD) – a bone and cartilage problem – can also occur in this breed. Rottweilers can develop progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), cataracts, eyelid deformities, and other vision and eye problems. Rottweilers can develop heart problems , including cardiomyopathy and subaortic stenosis (SAS), a narrowing of the aorta that carries blood away from the heart. This usually shows up first as a slight heart murmur, but murmurs can often occur in puppies who have no heart problems as adults. SAS can lead to sudden death, even at a young age, so have your dog’s heart checked regularly. Rotties are also more susceptible than many breeds to canine bloat , a condition in which the stomach can turn and block, causing a build-up of gas. Unless treated very quickly, bloat can be fatal. Hip and elbow dysplasia are genetically carried malformations. Retinal problems are inherited, as is the tendency to bloat. Rottweilers are sensitive to high temperatures . Never leave any dog outdoors on a hot day without access to shade and an unlimited supply of fresh water.",not available,not available,not available,"GROOMING The Rottweiler has what’s called a double coat. The medium-length outer coat is straight, coarse and dense, lying flat on the body. The soft, downy undercoat is present on the neck and thighs, and its thickness depends on whether you live in a cool or warm climate. The Rottweiler’s coat sheds moderately and requires little grooming. Brush him weekly with a rubber hound mitt or soft bristle brush to keep the hair and skin healthy. In spring and fall, he will have a heavy shed, known as “blowing out” the coat and will need to be brushed more frequently to get rid of all the loose hair. With the gentle dog shampoos available now, you can bathe your Rottie weekly without harming his coat or only when he gets dirty. Clean the ears as needed with a solution recommended by your veterinarian. Wipe out the ear with a cotton ball, never going deeper than the first knuckle of your finger. Trim the nails regularly, usually every couple of weeks. They should never be so long that they click on the floor. And don't forget to brush the teeth frequently with a specific pet toothpaste.",
Samoyed,"APPEARANCE The Samoyed is medium-size dog with a thick white coat and a big, permanent smile on his face that reflects the happy-go-lucky nature of the breed. The Samoyed is actually a rugged, compact working dog of both dignity and grace. He is a double-coated breed with a softer undercoat and a harsher standoffish outer coat. The Samoyed coat can be white, cream or biscuit or a combination of any of the three. Any colour other than listed or blue eyes are faults in the Samoyed. The Samoyed is, in spite of what you may have heard, a breed that does well in all elements.  While they prefer the cooler climates; the Samoyed acclimatises well to the warmer climates.  Their dual coat protects them in both cold and heat. You will just need to  use the common sense approach as it applies to the heat and humidity factors.  The Samoyed is less active during the summer months and will want to go outside in the summer months in the very early morning. Males are noticeably larger than females. Females are 45-51cm at the shoulder, the males are 51-56cm. Their weight is in proportion to the size. The Samoyed being essentially a working dog , he should be strong, active and graceful. As his work lies in cold climates his coat should be heavy and weather-resisting. For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website .","TEMPERAMENT Samoyeds are active, inquisitive, quick-witted and mischievous.  They remain playful through to old age.  With a twinkle in their dark, intelligent eyes and their ever present  smile, the Samoyed has been called the dog that carries in its face and heart the spirit of Christmas the whole year through. The Samoyed is alert, full of action but above all displaying affection towards all mankind. The Samoyed has often been accused of being wilful and stubborn, and certainly he can be easily bored and distracted. However, his original environment demanded a very intelligent breed with an independent nature. He is easy to train, but dislikes repetition. He thinks for himself, and ""if you keep throwing that ball away, you obviously don't want it!"" If not kept entertained, the Samoyed will entertain himself - he enjoys chewing and delights in ""gardening"". At the very least, a Samoyed requires daily walking. Samoyeds are naturals when it comes to dog sports, and will thrive on the stimulation and adrenaline rush of activities like obedience training and agility . There is also a dog sledding competition held annually during winter. Breeders warn that without the stimulation of daily exercise and people contact, the Samoyed will become a shadow of its true self and will fall into a depressed state.  This can lead to unruly behaviour, as well as a tendency to escape from the yard.  As with all dogs, early socialisation and training is a must with the Samoyed to ensure it develops good social skills. Many Samoyeds are barkers, which makes them great as watchdogs, but as guard dogs, they are often found lacking - they will bark when a stranger approaches, but then show him where to find the silverware. The constant companionship with man through the years, has given the Samoyed an uncanny human understanding.  His guarding of reindeer, requiring always a protector, never a killer, has developed a disposition in the breed unique in the canine world. A Samoyed is totally trustworthy with children and develops a close affinity with humans. Due to their exuberance with children’s games, supervision is strongly advised with toddlers to prevent accidental knocking. A Samoyed’s main objective in life is to sleep by his owners. He needs to be an integral part of your family . They are a human-oriented breed, and want to be with their people inside or where ever their people happen to be at any given time.  The affectionate Samoyed will be your friend for life!  If you are looking for a dog to put out in the backyard to greet as time permits, you are looking into the wrong breed. An ignored Sammie equals a bored Sammie resulting in behavioural problems.","HEALTH Like all breeds there may be some health issues, like hip dysplasia, PRA, RD/OSD, cardiac and eye disease. Some dogs may be faced with these health challenges in their lives, but the majority of Samoyeds are healthy dogs. The Samoyed is a medium dog breed and has a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.",not available,not available,not available,"GROOMING His magnificent white coat has two layers, a dense, woolly undercoat, which is typically shed out once a year, and a silver-tipped harsh outer coat of long, straight guard hairs.  Grooming this lovely coat can be a pleasure, or a chore, for both dog and owner. Surprisingly, that glamorous coat stays fairly clean and requires far less grooming than most people expect. Weekly brushing is usually enough and mud sheds easily when dry. Little bathing is required and there is none of the ""doggy odour"" often found in other breeds. As a side benefit of the thick white coat, the Samoyed readily adapts to climate extremes - both cold and hot. However, the coat will eventually ""blow"" - once or twice a year the undercoat sheds in a spectacular way requiring many hours work with a stripping comb. A Samoyed will only smell if ill (normally from hormonal imbalance or gastric upsets) or if the under coast is left wet for long periods of time. For this reason when washing a Samoyed it is important to dry the thick under coat as quickly as possible, investment into a strong hair dryer or dog blower with a good supply of talcum powder is a great investment when owning a Samoyed.",

Shetland Sheepdog,"APPEARANCE It is understandable how the Sheltie is often mistaken for a Collie pup. Shelties are in fact quite small, standing around 37 centimetres tall at the withers, around half the size of a Collie. Though small, Shelties are regarded by their owners as a breed of great beauty. The refined appearance of the breed is accentuated by the elegant head and a mane-like frill of abundant, long hair which envelops the shoulders and chest. The most common colours in Australia are sable, ranging from a pale gold to deep chocolate with white trimmings; a tri-colour of black with tan and white points; and the blue merle, blue with tan and white points. Other colours less often seen are the bi-colours of blue with white points or black with white points. For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC page","TEMPERAMENT Shelties are an intelligent breed and very responsive to training. Though loyal to their owners, Shelties are known to be timid and wary of strangers if not encouraged to socialise. Once settled, a Sheltie puppy will quickly consider itself a member of the family and will happily follow its owners around all day. Because of their adeptness to training, many Shelties in Australia excel in dog activities such as the show ring, tracking, flyball , agility and of course obedience. Exceptionally attentive and responsive, Shetland Sheepdogs are easy to train if you have a calm voice and a light hand on the leash. Sensitivity is one of the hallmarks of this breed. Often they need only verbal corrections, and they wilt or become defensive if you jerk them around. Praise, gentle guidance, and food rewards are the way to go with Shelties. More importantly, Shelties need ""mental exercise."" These bright dogs cannot just sit in the backyard and do nothing. To be happy and well-behaved, they require mental stimulation such as advanced obedience, agility , herding, or challenging games you play with them, even if it's just fetching balls and finding hidden toys. These dogs have quick reflexes, which can make them overly reactive to loud noises and sudden touches. Indeed, quite a few individuals are highstrung, startle easily, and do not do well in an environment with frequent tension, loud voices, or too much rough-housing. Most Shelties have a soft, sweet temperament. They're peaceful with other animals and polite with everyone, though typically reserved and sometimes timid with strangers. To build a confident temperament, the Shetland Sheepdog needs more extensive socialisation than many other breeds. Shelties become unhappy when left for long periods of time without companionship, and unhappiness can translate to neurotic behaviors, destructive chewing, or chronic barking. The major behavioural issue with Shelties can be excessive barking , and some individuals have high-pitched, piercing voices.","HEALTH & LIFESPAN The Shetland Sheepdog is generally regarded as a sound breed so expect your four-legged companion to be around for 12-16 years. However miniaturisation has brought with it some health concerns, particulary inherited eye conditions such as Collie Eye Anomaly and Progressive Retina Atrophy , both of which can lead to blindness. Diligent Australian breeders do test for these conditions, as well as Hip Dysplasia , so they should not be evident in most progeny. Ask the breeder for confirmation that their dogs have been tested. Keep in mind that Shelties are also prone to getting quite fat, so watch how much (and what) you feed. Finally, don’t forget regular oral care from a very early age to avoid concerns.",not available,not available,not available,GROOMING,
Siberian Husky,"The Siberian Husky is an arctic breed with striking blue or brown eyes – or one eye of each colour. The skull is medium sized and should be proportionate to the body, slightly rounded on top and tapering from the eyes forward. The muzzle is medium length and with, tapering gradually to the tip which is neither completely round nor completely square. The nose is black for gray, tan or black dogs, liver in cooper dogs, and can be flesh-coloured in white dogs. Some dogs have a nose that has pink streaks, referred to as “snow nose.” The ears sit high atop the head, are triangular in shape with slightly rounded tips that should point straight up in the air. The back is long and straight. Siberian Husky - Photo Credit: Asryn Kennel The Husky's tail is covered in thick fur and is fox-brushed shape. It is carried over the back in a sickle curve when the dog is alert, and trails when the dog is relaxed. The coat comes in many colours including various shades of gray and silver, sand, red, and black-and-white, often with striking markings on the head that are not found in other breeds. Height: Male: 54–60 cm; Female: 50–56 cm Weight: Male: 20–27 kg; Female: 16–23 kg For the full breed standard, please visit the ANKC website .","The Siberian Husky has a delightful temperament, affectionate but not fawning. This gentle and friendly disposition may be a heritage from the past, since the Chukchi people held their dogs in great esteem, housed them in the family shelters, and encouraged their children to play with them. The Siberian Husky is alert, eager to please, and adaptable. Their intelligence has been proven, but their independent spirit may at times challenge your ingenuity. The versatility of the Siberian Husky makes them an agreeable companion to people of all ages and varying interests. While capable of showing strong affection for their family, the Siberian huskies are not usually a one-person dog. They exhibit no fear or suspicion of strangers, and will greet guests cordially. Theirs is not the temperament of a watchdog, although a Siberian husky may unwittingly act as a deterrent to those ignorant of their true hospitable nature. A Siberian rarely barks – they prefer to whine or moan and will hold their head high and produce a beautiful howl. If the howl persists the neighbours may get upset – they are a rather vocal dog. In their interactions with unfamiliar dogs, the Siberian Husky displays friendly interest and gentlemanly decorum.  If attacked, however, they are ready and able to defend themselves. Predatory instincts in the Siberian Husky are strong. While the Siberian is normally gentle and friendly with people and other dogs, owners MUST be aware that small animals in and around the home, such as rabbits, birds, guinea pigs and cats, are potential victims of their strong predatory instinct. Chewing and digging?  Siberian huskies have been known to do their share. Bored Siberian Huskies are famous for chewing through drywall, ripping the stuffing out of sofas, and turning your yard into a moonscape of giant craters. Digging holes is a pastime that many Siberian Huskies have a special proclivity for so if you take great pride in your landscaping efforts…  Don’t buy a Siberian Husky.","HEALTH Huskies are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they can be prone to certain health conditions. Breed health concerns may include crystalline corneal opacity, epilepsy , hip dysplasia, hypothyroidism, juvenile cataracts, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), nasal depigmentation, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and von Willebrand disease. The average life span of the Siberian Husky is 12 to 14 years.","HOUSEPET POTENTIAL To make sure you can safely invite a Husky into your home you will need to have: Six foot fences around your entire yard with proper latching gates.  Huskies can dig, chew, squeeze and climb their way out of even apparently secure yards, and have been known to learn to operate simple gate locks. Time during the day and especially the morning and evening to walk, play with and be a close companion to your Husky.  They are not a set-and-forget breed and need to be included in all the variety of your family’s daily life, every single day.  A family’s lack of time is the number one reason most Huskies end up in rescue. A commitment to training to bring out the best in your Husky, and manage their intelligence, exuberance, assertiveness and even affection using motivational training techniques. Lack of basic discipline is the number two reason most huskies end up in rescue.

They are by nature fastidiously clean and free from body odour and parasites. Once or twice a year the Siberian Husky sheds his coat, and it is then, when armed with a comb and a garbage bag, that one realizes the amazing density and profusion of the typical Siberian Husky coat. Some people feel that this periodic problem is easier to cope with than the constant shedding and renewal of many smooth-coated breeds. If you like fur all over the house and in the very air you breathe, then fine. If, however, you value neatness at all times, then… Don’t buy a Siberian Husky.",

It is essential that pups between 8-18 weeks are well socialised, especially with children and other dogs. Breeders warn, too, that the friendly nature of most Staffords means they go to strangers readily and risk being stolen for use in illegal dog fights.","Some Staffords can suffer from a few hereditary diseases that can be tested by DNA as a puppy, such as Hip Dysplasia (degenerative bone disease), Luxating Patellas (slipping kneecaps) and Entropion (an eye disease), but none are common in the breed. Staffies is known to be at a higher risk from mastocytoma (mast cell tumours) than the general population of dogs.",not available,not available,not available,Staffords are happiest indoors with the family; they shed little hair and are easily house-trained. Fortnightly bathing is adequate if the dog spends most of its time indoors.,
Weimaraner,"APPEARANCE The Weimaraner is a powerful-looking dog, well-muscled for strength and stamina and deep-chested for endurance. The coat is short, smooth, sleek, and solid-coloured, ranging from mouse-gray to silver-gray, usually with lighter shades on the head and ears. The Weimaraner head is aristocratic, with muzzle and skull being the same length. Eyes must be light amber, gray, or blue-gray; ears are fairly long and are set high on the head and folded over. The nose is dark gray and the skin pink (not white or black) inside the flaps of the ears and on the lips. Weight: Male: 32-37 kg; Female: 25-32 kg Height: Male: 63-68 cm; Female: 58-63 cm For the full breed standard, please visit the ankc.org.au","TEMPERAMENT The Weimaraner is a housedog however he’s not suited to apartment living. This highly active dog needs both a large, securely fenced backyard where he can run and an active family who can provide him with the exercise and mental stimulation he needs. Weimaraner competing in Dog Agility Weimaraners need a couple of hours of exercise daily if you want to prevent recreational barking , digging and chewing. You could play fetch and other running games, take him jogging or hiking, teach him to run alongside your bicycle, or get him involved in a dog sport such as agility or flyball . In the house, a mature, well-trained Weimaraner will be your shadow, from bedroom to bathroom to kitchen to den. Weimaraners are more prone than many breeds to suffer from separation anxiety and can become destructive and ""dig"" in your carpet or sofa in an attempt to create a secure nest. Weimaraners are highly intelligent, but they're also independent thinkers. This combination can make them a challenge when it comes to training. Be consistent and firm, but gentle. Among the tricks your Weimaraner may learn are getting ice from the dispenser in the door of your refrigerator, turning on faucets, and opening gates and doors.","HEALTH Weimaraners are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions: Hip Dysplasia: This is an abnormality of the hip joint. It may affect one or both sides. Dogs with hip dysplasia may or may not show any clinical signs. Although the tendency toward hip dysplasia is thought to be inherited, diet, rapid growth, and environment also are thought to be contributors to the condition. Bloat or Gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV):  This is a life-threatening condition that can affect large, deep-chested dogs, especially if they are fed one large meal a day, eat rapidly, drink large volumes of water after eating, and exercise vigorously after eating. Some think that raised feeding dishes and type of food might be a factor in causing this to happen too. It is more common among older dogs. Skin Allergies",not available,not available,not available,"GROOMING A Weimaraner is one of the easiest breeds to groom. Even when he has been running through mud, the dirt just seems to fall off him. Weekly brushing with a bristle brush should keep his coat and skin healthy. Weimaraners shed, but brushing will help keep loose hair off your clothes and furniture. Bathe when needed. He takes great pleasure in rolling in anything stinky, so this may be more often than would normally be necessary. All breeds with hanging ears are prone to ear infections. Check your Weimaraner's ears weekly and wipe them out with a cotton ball moistened with a cleanser recommended by your veterinarian. Your Weimaraner may have an ear infection if the inside of the ear smells bad, looks red or seems tender, or he frequently shakes his head or scratches at his ear.",
Whippet,"APPEARANCE The Whippet looks like a miniature Greyhound , sleek, lithe and built for speed. The Whippet is an amazing athlete and its acceleration ability gives it jack-rabbit starts, covering 183m in 12 seconds and being clocked at more than 59.5 kmh! They reach 44-47cm and their bodies are relatively small, with females weighing approx. 8 to 12 kilos and males 11 to 15 kilos. Whippets come in all colours – either solid (black, white, blue, red, fawn) or broken with white (parti coloured) and with or without brindle.  The colour range and markings means that there is a huge variety, but you can rest assured that the character of each and every whippet is the same. For the full breed standard, visit the ANKC website","TEMPERAMENT Whippets have outstanding temperaments, being friendly, affectionate and easy-going. They are said to be dogs which are very sensitive to the mood of their owners, and will behave accordingly. They do, however, love a chase and small fluffy animals may be at risk if a Whippet is off the leash! This means that basic obedience is a must for your puppy.  It is possible to train a puppy from a very young age NOT to chase, or to call him off a chase and to come back immediately on command. Whippets are sweet natured with people, easy to house train and enjoy sharing life in the house with the family.  They are smooth, short coated and require little maintenance aside from love, food and being almost completely lounge lizards.  They are, however, still sighthounds, and as such, will instinctively chase rapid moving objects.","HEALTH The Whippet is one of the soundest dogs seen by vets, and doesn’t appear to suffer from any major hereditary diseases. The major consideration in owning a Whippet is because they are thin skinned and lean without much body fat, they feel the cold. Whippets need a coat in the cooler months but when buying, ensure you ask for a coat suited to a Whippet so that the back is curved to fit the dog. Whippets are a very healthy, hardy breed which enjoy a long life (14-17 years). They love running however and collisions can cause injuries. Because of their speed a piece of broken glass or metal hidden in long grass can cause a serious injury. It is also extremely advisable NOT to let your whippet puppy run “out of control” until he reaches the age of 1 year old. By this stage his bone development will be “set” (rather than still “soft”) and a skeletal injury is less likely to happen.",not available,"SPACE & EXERCISE Whilst they will mostly be content to live indoors and share your life, they are able to take virtually any amount of exercise you can give them. They are athletic enough to jump, and skinny enough to squeeze through, so your fencing needs to be in good order and high enough to keep them in. Don't be alarmed - a 4' fence will keep most whippets in, and generally, they don't want to leave home, however, there have been the occasional whippet who will jump 1.8m if there is something tempting enough on the other side. Most Whippet experts will agree that the only reason why a Whippet would leave home is because they are either bored, lonely or unhappy and are simply looking for a better place to live.  All of the above can be remedied by obtaining another Whippet or a small quiet dog from a shelter to be their buddy.  Whippets do not enjoy being a lone dog.  They will love you to pieces but if you are missing for 8 hours the next best thing is a buddy to keep them company during the day. Also Whippets do not readily adjust to being an outside dog so it is advisable to organise a dog flap so they have access to a laundry or better still, the couch when you are not at home to let them in. The Whippet is not a breed that requires lots of exercise or a huge backyard to run in. They will fit in with whatever exercise you are able to offer, however they dearly love any opportunity to stretch out and have a good gallop. After all, they were bred to run and chase and they certainly do that at a very fast speed. Sighthounds can easily be distracted by any moving object, so if you let your Whippet off lead, ensure it’s in a safe fenced area. It is recommended that you use a soft collar that is broad in the middle and narrows to the side – either with a check action or martingale style. Whippets have long, narrow heads, and they can easily reverse and slip out of a normal collar. Bran the Whippet destroying the irrigation system... Whippets love toys and will spend hours amusing themselves with their toys. They aren’t destructive and often keep their puppy toys into their adult life. However, bored and left to their own devices this is what can happen to your irrigation system...","ACTIVITIES AND DOG SPORTS Whippets love to chase, so mechanical lure coursing can be great fun for them. They chase a plastic bag over varying distances, with some twists and turns. Whippets have become great obedience champions, but if the hard work and dedication of Obedience is not for you, then you might like to try Agility which is another strong suit of Whippets. You will train your dog to negotiate obstacles like jumps, ramps, tunnels, see-saws and even jumping through hoops. Another sport to consider for Whippets is Flyball which is a very fast sport and attracts many spectators. Dogs are in teams and race up, hit the board, catch the ball and run back to their owner.","GROOMING One of the delightful aspects of the Whippet is that it requires the barest minimum of grooming. With such a short, sleek coat, the Whippet is not a breed that has a ‘doggy’ smell. They love to be clean themselves and are rather cat-like in this aspect. Regular clipping of toe nails, teeth cleaning and the occasional bath or wipe down is all that is needed.  They are a clean dog by nature which makes them an ideal house pet. Yes, they have a fine, short coat, but all dogs will shed coat at some point in the year – generally change of season. When this happens, a brush through will remove most of the loose hair and you should have it over and done with quickly. Your Whippet’s teeth are essentially no different to your own and they need the same care and maintenance. Please discuss this aspect of your dog’s health with your vet. It’s a good idea to get into a routine for clipping toenails. Start early, when you first have your puppy, and set aside a time each week or fortnight to clip the tips off the toenails. If you do this regularly, and reward your dog, it will be an easy and pleasurable experience. Nail clipping is a fact of life if you own a Whippet because even if exercised on concrete or bitumen, their body weight is not heavy enough to wear nails down.  If you are at all squeamish about cutting nails, please visit your local groomer at least monthly to keep nails well trimmed as overly long nails can actually cripple the feet if left for any length of time.",
